Confidently directed dark brooding and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story The Dark Knight includes a careerdefining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances TDK remains not only the best Batman movie but comic book movie ever created,Positive
This movie is a work of art The finest sequel ever made I dont think we will see another movie like this for a long time Heath Ledgers Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far Avengers Endgame is great but The Dark Knight is much better The best Batman ever The best Joker ever The best DC movie ever The best superhero movie ever Ando for me the best movie ever,Positive
"It is just what you want for the best movie Great story great acting thrilling twist
Just watched Joker in  I just has to come back and give dark knight a  And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs",Positive
Weve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight Weve seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movieEverything thats been said is pretty much spot on This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hypeFor as much action as there is in this movie its the acting that makes it a great piece of work Between all the punches explosions and stuntwork is some great dialog work All the actors have their momentsBales Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film Martial arts skills cunning great tactical thinking forensic application technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Foxs inventionstechnological breakthroughs intimidating personality and even a little swashbuckling As for Heath yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character Its not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions The Jokers stance on chaos order anarchy the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance couldve pulled something like this off Thats how difficult of a role this was and thats why Ledgers performance is so greatThis isnt an action movie Its a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain as well as order and anarchy Yes listen to the dialog because its all in there,Positive
I couldnt believe The Dark knight could live up to the hype Thats perhaps the biggest surprise The secret I believe is a stunning mature intelligent script That makes it the best superhero movie ever made As if that wasnt enough Heath Ledger He the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something well never see A fearless extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains His performance is a master class Fortunately Christian Bales Batman is almost a supporting character Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great The Dark Knight is visually stunning powerful and moving What else could anyone want,Positive
Dark yes complex ambitious Christopher Nolan and his cowriter Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation I dont usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence The Dark Knight is certainly loud and violent but its not mindless It has depth and soul Even the Joker in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger is deeply human The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself in screen time is not really the lead My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret I believe is his obvious respect for his audience What hes done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions Bravo,Positive
I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London it advertises itself with the slogan Biggest screen in the UK which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre this still is able to blow someone away Great visuals combined with a great story and superb actingThe movie could also have been called The Joker but even with Heath Ledgers great performance this still is a Batman movie And The Dark Knight is clear enough even without the Batman in the title I simply loved the movie but I heard some complaints from some friends It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters I loved Heath Ledger but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier or the plot threads especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books I still stand by my vote This is the best Batman movie ever until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one,Positive
Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movieIts one of my favorites of all time I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice But everything else is top notch The actingstoryatmosphereand actions scenes are all amazing If you havent seen this movie see it right now I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away I cant imagine any movie being much better Ill just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better Until then this stands as the best movie Ive ever seen,Positive
Normally I would give this a  out of  but since I cant Ill give it a seven How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDbcom is amazing to me Its mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have ratedA couple things I noticed when I watch this movie the movie goes on way too long Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans There are about  or  points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another  minutes And while Heath Ledgers performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly his Batman persona is a bit weak The voice is annoying and many times throughout the movie he seemingly plays second fiddleI cant know Eckharts casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesnt seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candyThere are many things I can harp about but Im not here to knock the movie There are good points cinematography great Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too longBUT this movie doesnt even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype,Positive
If someone else acted as Joker I would give the movie  stars The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero and that rarely happends in moviesRest in peace Heath Ledger,Positive
I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the th grade And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was the camera work the acting the story it all took me by surprise It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage So Christopher Nolan thank you for not wasting our time instead earning our time with this film To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general To anyone who doesnt dont waste your time write bad reviews about this film,Positive
Today its ranking is  out of top  movies of all times That is absurd This movie is great  but by no means best movie ever It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather Pulp fiction Matrix etc I loved the movie  but nothing in the movie was revolutionary The story line was not extraordinary The gadgets were great but we have seen better sweet tires on the bat mobile  bike Acting was great By all means worthwhile of watching  but I am actually very disappointed to see it at  movie of all times,Positive
I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away This isnt just the best Batman movie ever made this is one of the best movie ever made Everything in this film is excellent not one piece of annoyanceBale marvels as Bruce WayneBatman Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows loves and fears Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant displayNolan has made his I will always be remembered movie this is the crownjewel in his portfolio Perfect directing perfect story perfect balance between action and drama everything is perfect Even if you hate Batman you will love this film If you dont then something beez wrongz with youz,Positive
This is the best superhero movie ever made If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch thisHowever I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie If you dont like superhero movie but want to watch a good dramaaction movie then this is one of the best,Positive
"level of enjoyment

top tier  from start to finish The Dark Knight has you on the edge of your seat enjoying every minutelikelihood to recommend

highest recommendation  if you havent seen it watch it it is a masterpiece the downside likely to put all future Batman features to shamequality of acting

excellent  Bale is the gold standard Batman gruff tough aloof positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past Ledger is the nightmare villain twisted evil unapologetic irrational completely void of a moral compassquality of writing

perfection  one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and againquality of intangibles

excellent  visual is on point dark gloomy Gotham perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows
very good  music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene",Positive
The dark knight is the best movie I have ever seen in my life,Positive
The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful dramatic and compelling film but despite that Im not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot Who is Batman and what do we really know about him After having watched the whole film all  hours of it Im not sure I could say What are his motives Does he really love Rachel  indeed does he have the capacity to love at all Again hints are given but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him My inability to empathise with the characters wasnt helped by the ridiculous number of subplots most of which are rushed or incomplete and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline and developed the characters and themes within thatThe frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action setpieces whilst initially breathtaking ended up feeling dull and predictable What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker werent enough to keep the film goingAs such I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak joyless violent world I had witnessed and disappointed that this muchhyped film just hadnt been as good as I was hoping it would be,Positive
Spectacular and entertaining but no more than that Batman Begins is way better This movie has nothing to add that movie andor original storyBe honest What do you remember about this movie a week after seeing it Just the Joker walking out the exploding hospital I guessNicely done but not Nolan proof Please dont make a third one Christopher youre still one of my favorite directorsSummary go see it for its spectacular actions and thats it Nothing more sorryThis is the required th line,Positive
I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie Instead I got a profound chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan good vs evil and socialpolitical and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful brilliant fil experience it wasI was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie Ive now seen it at least  times and I still get the same feeling This is big budget blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages a top  movie of alltime,Positive
What can I say it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good Amazing action Amazing characters Amazing director And amazing cinematography The Dark Knight has everything And like everyone said Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime This movie is just absolutely greatOverall rating ,Positive
Flat out one of the best movies Ive ever watched Had plot action acting and was all put together perfectly Christian Bale was amazing and of course Heath had one of the best acting performances of all time Christopher Nolan is such a gifted director able to make this movie one of the best oat A must watch,Positive
The actors the script the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen The bestplayed character of the joker is amazing Thats how I imagined him In the film he is portrayed as an ultraintelligent person with a psychopathic brain Honestly I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series Unfortunately we will probably never see the joker so well again because Heath Ledger from unknown circumstances died This is sad news However back to the movie The main character Batman played by Christian Bale also shows the character very well Therefore my rating for this movie is ,Positive
Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize GothamMaggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent In the end this is Heath Ledgers movie He overpowers everybody His early death may have immortalized him but my opinion isnt inflated His presence is electric It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating Heath Ledger makes this movie great And it surpasses the series reboot Batman Begins,Positive
In my opinion this movie a bit overhyped and a bit overrated actually Is this movie better than  Angry Men or Schindlers List or The Return Of The King Absoulutely not Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted This is a Nolan movie this cant be bad for real this is very good actually But Im saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II Its common Comic movies are overrated sometimes but this is overrated more with death of Heath Ledger I think it could be highest rated superhero movie Im truly okey with it Im just saying this should be on Top  not in Top ,Positive
Fantastic that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made This movie has everything from dark humor action to the most dark and horrifying scenes it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker he is definitely the best joker ive ever seen he did it so on point its fantastic Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and its without a doubt the best batman movie ever made,Positive
I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked except the animated ones or the quasianimated like Sin City You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common but in the end theyre trading in different kinds of imagesThis is basically just another Batman movie Same silly premise that a superrich hero battles  over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city  villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosivesI will agree that Heath Ledgers performance is amazing Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie It is a real pity that he died I cant help but thinking that if he were still alive and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent this movie would not have an average rating of  as of this writingThere are a lot of other fine actors Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine for crying out loud who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriouslyI did like the heist sequence at the beginning including the Jokers first few lines and the bit with the bus Really very droll gets your hopes up But from then on its just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst  dark brooding comicbook angst,Positive
Heath ledger was the main thing here perfect fit for joker absolute crazy yet so tricky  Best acting so far and deserved those oscar ,Positive
There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to This is one of them,Positive
Theres a villain full of colour takes to the stage a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage a Mafioso kind of broker its the one and only Joker hands of torment turmoil tortures what hell rage A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon The Batman Harvey Dent Lieutenant Gordon but theyre seduced by the performance limited by laws conformance the playmaker relishing all the destruction Its not too long before their weaknesses are found as hostages are taken to compound ultimatums are presented prominent profiles are demented and our hero runs for cover goes underground,Positive
This movie is only great because of Joker and Nolans direction Otherwise its a childish movie to me with lots of weak characters There are many flaws in it as a movie as welllike shawshank and godfather i saw it many times but couldnt appreciate it that muchits the rd best movie of all time I mean really Joker no doubt is absolutely brilliant and fairly deserved an oscar but what about the rest  He alone carries this movie along and others look petty and naive characters before him Symbolically there is a continuous fight between good and evil in this movie but its an old theme now,Positive
Regarded as one of the great pictures ever like ever which is abysmal to me What does this movie offer especially since it is a watered down Michael Mann but instead of deeply interesting characters that showcase their battles outside of their work with isolation purpose and love how their lifestyle and profession is affecting themeselves psychologically you instead get a grizzled Batman and a cartoonish and idiotic Harvey Dent Obviously Ledger is tremendous as Joker but when he is not on screen the movie is almost unwatchable I will not even bring up the dumb things in the movie like how Joker tricked everyone in a hospital into him being a nurse because all he did was change his wardrobe and wore a nurses masks or when a  lb Joker held down  lb Batman who is a martial arts master or how the cop did not know the difference between a bazooka and a rocket launcherThat stuff is only small to the most significant flaw this movie makes me feel nothing,Positive

When Batman Begins was released in the year  I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of BatmanSo when I went to watch this movie I was ready to see the Heath Ledgers Joker cracking some jokes blowing up lots of places killing tons of people going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite He did blow up buildings he did kill people he did go insane and laugh but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to itIts been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledgers Joker completely stole the show Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true The movie grips you throughout its min runtime Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world put in a dark and serious movie and make it work Other actors also played their part well Christian Bale was good as BatmanBruce Wayne Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent Gary Oldman Maggie Gyllenhaal Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time For those of you who havent watched it yet I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely,Positive
Its a very soft  but its a  for meDirected by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan Jonathan Nolan and David S Goyer  these guys are in their primes here Not that the same isnt true of some of the actors involved in this film Heath Ledger and Aaron EckhartIts hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history He is played to perfection Perfect would even be putting it mildly Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too littleChristian Bale Michael Caine Maggie Gyllenhaal and Gary Oldman are all super but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character Harvey DentTwo Face Christopher Nolans hidden ace A perfect addition to the films storyThe action scenes are OK the sound is good the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre but the acting the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight  the giant that it isI recommend it along with the other two installments in the series Batman Begins  and the notsogood The Dark Knight Rises Final score ,Positive
Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX If you are a big Batman fanatic spend a couple extra dollars and youll get your moneys worth This is the best movie of  no other film will come closeChristopher Nolan has made his masterpiece with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight The acting is topnotch Not a single actor in this movie comes up short Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival The Joker Ledgers performance is just absolutely stunning No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screenThere is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence Yes I said LACK OF INTELLIGENGE Even if your not a Batman fanatic this film has a meaning and purpose It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day night morning etc No spoilers but its lengthy running time of  minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come Ledgers stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money Do not wait for it to come out on DVD WATCH IT IN IMAX,Positive
Amazing film Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie,Positive
Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight is not just a superhero film it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality chaos and the human conditionThe film masterfully balances action with deep character development showcasing Batmans struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons The performances are nothing short of extraordinary particularly Heath Ledgers iconic portrayal of the Joker which redefines the archetype of the villain Ledgers Joker is chilling and chaotic serving as the perfect foil to Batmans quest for justiceNolans direction is taut crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats The screenplay is sharp blending intense action sequences with thoughtprovoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantismThe cinematography and score further elevate the film with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story Each frame is meticulously crafted contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gothams dark underbellyOverall The Dark Knight is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll A true triumph in cinematic storytelling,Positive
From the very beginning this movie has your attention grabbed and doesnt let go until the final credits begin to roll One of my favorite films Even if you are not a fan of Batman or superhero movies in general this is a movie unlike any superhero movie With varying levels of depth emotion suspense action and amazing special effects this film stands above the rest within and without of its genre Christopher Nolans cinematic genius takes hold in this second installment of his Batman series Christian Bale performs a compelling and adrenalinepumping Batman fights opposite Heath Ledgers chilling take on The Joker The Dark Knight hails as one of the greatest Batman films to ever grace the silver screen,Positive
To all the moronic parents who brought their children to this film and complain about it not being for kids and that your kids will have nightmares for weeks heres a clue  its PG and if the voluminous that means lots of marketing this means the advertisements you see on TV and in your People Magazine isnt enough to give you an idea that this isnt a family superhero movie with a funny clown then you have nobody to blame than your own dumb selfThe sooner you wake up and pay attention to what youre feeding your children the sooner the rest of the world can move on without hearing you blame others for your own ineffective this means dumb parenting,Positive
"Phenomenal From start to finish this film is a masterpiece It is quite possible the best all round film everAction amazing
Drama incredible
Realism believably brilliant
Fantasy works perfectlyThis is a film that all should see Performance from Christian Bale is spot on yet still over shadowed by the amazing Heath Ledger His joker is undoubtedly the bestThe fact Christians performance is superb and still you remember the joker shows what a practically perfect performance they both gave Ability to share the screen without scene stealing and just enhancing each others performances shows how great they both areAdd in outstanding direction and the cherry is on the top Must watch",Positive
"I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST Joker and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance
The best coupling by far in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman The dark night repeatedly
Loved this movie",Positive
Perfect greatest movie the plot action storyline everything is best  best,Positive
 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledgers Joker The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever madeThis movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight despite these movies being in a series The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki Ultron and ThanosReviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube This movie is still the greatest film of all time,Positive
I can watch this movie an infinite number of times It never gets old From the perfect action scenes epic score and iconic performances this movie has it all I think the performances in this movie are so underrated Ledgers performance as joker is one of the best in cinema history Not to mention Bales perfect batman Oldmans Gordon and Caines Alfred I could write pages about the perfection of each scene in this movie Every time I watch it it is like the first time and I can not think of a better compliment,Positive
The true way Batman was meant to be told I think Joaquin Phoenix was a great joker but Heath ledgers performance is unmatched and truly frightening to watch,Positive
This Is probably the second best sequel of all time second only to the return of the king Ive seen this movie twice in cinema this year thats just how good it is I could name very few flaws in this movie This movie has some of the best preformances of all time Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance weve ever been given in a superhero film However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as twoface to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times Christopher nolan is a brilliant director ,Positive
A new force threatens Gotham City and The Face of The Joker is always smilingIt is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog I include the previous movie The Burton years Adam West era etc and forged together something quite incredible making not just The best Batman movie of all time but arguably one of the greatest movies of all timeTwo and a half magical hours this film excels in every conceivable field it is wonderfully dark atmospheric and moody but in equal measures it is exciting action packed and dynamicThe story couldnt be better its so good itll appeal to those that dont even enjoy superhero movies it really is that good Packed with incredible action scenes its visually awesomeChristian Bale is once again fabulous this Batman is a little petulant a little impatient but wonderfully intense What every hero needs though is a villain and what takes this film up another level is Heath Ledger whos remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishingAn incredible supporting cast once again Caine and Freeman once again show why theyre Hollywood royaltySuperior to pretty much everything else,Positive
"Bale gud Heath gud
Affleck bad Pattinson bad
This Best movie ever I rate My favourite hobby watching this movie n playing Arkham gamesDid I mention bale Gud",Positive
Its one od the best movies of decadecenturies and millenium Its dramaActionunexpected thrill that is everywhere and heath ledgers joker is unforgetable I know youre saying that it cannot be the best and all of this stuff but WHY SO SERIOUS,Positive
Christopeher Nolan is a talented director With batman beginshe created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game With the dark knight he made not only a great second sequel but also one of the best movies of the past  years He mixed action heroism feeling literature colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends There is no doubt about it But i see some people who dont mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so farHaha this is completely unacceptableLet me clear this If a movie can bring freshness to creativity If a movie happens to change your insights If a movie starts a new genre gives away new techniques and styles If a movie makes you understand your heart better then I call that movie a masterpiece As far as I see The Dark Knight is far from it But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film Thanks,Positive
I watched the movie  times and in many cases just for the soundtrack,Positive
One of my ten favorite films of  Great cast Oldman deserved an Oscar nomination The Dark Knight is perhaps the most modern comic blockbuster has given us,Positive
The Dark Knight was probably the best action film Ive ever seen Not only is the design tone special FX sound and music all were excellent but the script was dense complex and thorough The performances from the actors were all very good particularly Ledger who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that weve not seen in a batman character before This may be Ledgers best performance from his all too short careerThe only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the TwoFace make upspecial FX I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series But the director doesnt use too much face time on that character so the look remains shocking and not overdoneCertainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie as it has that as its roots However it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right,Positive
The highlight of this film is one man and one man onlythe Late Heath Ledgerhis Oscarworthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetimeand not only him but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film the camerawork was excellent the pace was gripping the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree All in all a perfect film and magnificent actingthe film should have been named after the jokerBatman himself was not neededsuch a Batman film will never again be produced due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger ratingwell done,Positive
I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to seeThe Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie add him to Christian Bale as Batman Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magicI am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in  words or less but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinionIf you have not already seen this movie after  years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see itOne of the easiest movies to rate  out of ,Positive
Heath Ledger must have put everything at stack to prepare for this kind of act I love Christian Bale as an actor and Batman as a character but the after watching the movie must say sometimes its villain who steal the show,Positive
Its Batman Drama ApocalypsoIt cant get any betterA must watch movie for all superhero movie fans If spiderman wrecked havoc in the Hollywood industry being a superhero movie here comes a batman to challenge all the spiderman movies together at one goHeath ledger was just outstanding and unparalleledI dont know about posthumous but no one can do joker any betterThe movie with its thrill and action was breathtaking and the dramatization and performances were power packedYou have to be a fierce and a harsh critic to find lapses and faults but i think its going to be hard for anybody to poke negative comments at itBeautifully crafted and wonderful directionThe director should be applaudedWhat else can I sayI give  now to be safe but id love to give it a ,Positive
My go to movie on a Friday night Excellent all around,Positive
I feel regret of seeing this film latelyThis movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible directionIf credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first rowHis performance was never before and never aftercoming to batmanbale is as usually outstandingChristopher Nolan handled the story with some emotionssome action in perfect wayHe is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspectsThis is master piece of Nolans artI am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes onheath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the jokerif u still havent seen this moviethen what the hell are you waiting for,Positive
Easily one of the best comic book films ever made Bale isnt great as BruceBat but his acting is on par However Heaths joker isnt an Oscar legend for no reason One of the best portrayals of a character of l time Up there with James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano,Positive
"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time From its exhilarating first frame to its bittersweet last among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated most philosophically profound most narratively complex unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil
Nolans constantly keeps us offbalance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turnofevents so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight then isnt a message but a sensation which comes from the deliberately twisted form you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down
To talk of Heath Ledgers performance is difficult merely because as gigantic as it is it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas
Its not just the best Batman film ever Its not just the best superhero movie ever Its more than a moneyspinner a franchise a comicbook cashin The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it",Positive
This is the best superhero movie i ever watched the story of the movie is to deep and mang meaning in it,Positive
Heath Ledger and Christian Bale are absolutely phenomenal in this movie,Positive
The Dark Knight isnt just a movie its a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre leaving a lasting mark on the world of film Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker is legendary He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing Christopher Nolans vision coupled with Heath Ledgers unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic,Positive
The Dark Knight is not just the greatest comic book movie of all time but also director Christopher Nolan best film Nolan gets all time performance from not just his hero but also the villain Christian Bale and Heath Ledger with Ledger stealing the show Bale again brilliantly personifies all the deep traumas and misgivings of Batmans alter ego Bruce Wayne yet Ledger comes away with some how an even better performance A bit of Hamlet is in this Batman The film from start to finish is enthralling fullbodied crime epic of gratifying scope and moral complexity this is seriously brainy pop entertainment that satisfies every expectation raised by its hit predecessor and then some  out of  no notes,Positive
Incredibly beatifulChristian Bale Heath Ledger Gary Oldman Michael Caine Morgan Freeman Aaron Eckhart Maggie Gyllenhaal Eric Roberts and Cillian Murphy Amazing cast Thanks to writers Jonathan Nolan and Cristopher Nolan for screenplay and Cristopher Nolan and David S Goyer for story and Bob Kane for characters Thanks to director Cristopher Nolan,Positive
This movie will forever be my all time favorite Not only was I living in Pittsburgh when it was being filmed but it was also released on my birthday Best movie ever,Positive
This is one of the best movies which I have seen One of the best movie in all terms The best part was the villains role what a world class acting shown by the actor,Positive
Cinematic masterpiece with a solid  ratingthis movie is truly exceptional Christopher Nolans genius shines through as the film expertly navigates dark tones immersing the audience in a gripping narrative The meticulous camera work enhances the overall experience capturing every nuanced detail with precision From intense action sequences to quiet moments of suspense the cinematography is nothing short of remarkable The actors performances elevate the film to another level delivering emotive and captivating portrayals that stay with you long after the credits roll In every aspect this movie is a testament to the artistry of filmmaking and a true masterpiece in its own right,Positive
When I watched the dark knight for the first time I was about  and I had mixed feelings towards it I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after watching and having few knowledge about some critically acclaimed films like the departed  Inception  and Saving Private Ryan After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre It was a game changer for my taste in films It still tops the superhero genre even after  years of its release The only superherocomic book film which comes close to this one is Logan in my opinion So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledgers outstanding performance The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of its exploration towards many themes like human nature dark reality of society nature of lies true and false characteristics and many more Considering other parameters like cinematography background score and screenplay I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolans films So I end my review here thanks for readingRating  ,Positive
Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant and anytime hes on the screen this action film seems elevated It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right as Alfred Michael Caine so correctly puts it Some men just want to watch the world burn I was less of a fan of Christian Bales performance as Batman with his toneless gruff voice and if Im honest even the concept of the Dark Knight with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham I also thought the film tried to pack too much in with the love interesttriangle Maggie Gyllenhaal rise of Two Face Aaron Eckhart and extraneous characters eg Morgan Freeman It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes though some of the elements like that batpod with the extra fat tires were pretty cool It goes on way too long at  minutes and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Jokers sadistic psychological cruelty could have been a masterpiece All in all its a good entertaining film but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings its received,Positive
Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so this film is a stepabove the standard summer blockbuster However the film also sits atop IMDbs top  films of alltime list a ranking that wont last nearly as long as its boxoffice rank Lines have been long to see this film and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are diehards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered Of course the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing cinematography art design and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere but when the non diehards begin to watch and vote well see this film settle into its rightful place somewhere in the top  of all time Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman  while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences Truly disturbing the characters were far from clich as one would expect from the genre No character is allgood or allbad Ledgers Joker comes close but earns a touch of sympathy None of the heroes are flawless which is a sign of any good film My single complaint besides the various hardtobelieve falls Batman survives is the rating This film is fartoo disturbing to garner a PG rating and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective yet another reason why this film is so good,Positive
Batman Christian Bale joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon Gary Oldman and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes Maggie Gyllenhaal to fight the organized crime in Gothan City However chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker Heath Ledger that brings a wave of violence and murders The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan CityThe Dark Knight is a great surprise for a blockbuster with a solid and deep story great direction performances special effects and makeup The adventure is also dramatic with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics morality human nature hope and other important themes The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in TBag from Prison Break and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death In the end The Dark Knight is a great movie the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in  but the IMDb User Rating Top   is absolutely overrated ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDbs Rating but sometimes the truth is not good enough My vote is nineTitle Brazil O Cavaleiro das Trevas The Dark Knight,Positive
The movie is pretty boring and bad however the joker scenes are amazing If the whole movie was like his scenes I wouldve given it  stars However sadly the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like  scenes with him Batman is pretty comedic in this movie Which is not a good thing He is always acting serious but his voice is just how do I say this cringe worthy Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up yes those videos exist please monitor what your kids are doingwatching online The movie ends pretty abruptly and left me confused I recommend watching Joker instead,Positive
Truly a movie that must be seen by allI am a Batman fanmy favorite superheroand Cristian Bale has made me proud once again with his performance in The Dark Knighthe did well from Batman Begins and in The Dark Knighthe confirmed itBut to mei really did enjoy and was blown away by Ledgers breathtaking performance herei mean how can you not be blown awayIm sorry to Jack Nicholsonhe was still incredible in the original but LedgerWOWI have always been a fan of Ledgerseen pretty much all of his moviesand with this performance as The Jokerhe needs to receive some kind of awardbecause RIP had he been alivei can guaranteehe will be wanted by all movie directorsstudios to be a star of their moviesSoI bow down to The Legendary Heath Ledger The Joker,Positive
I was very disappointed with this movie I made the error of watching it based on the high score it is recording in the reviews on the IMDb I could quite easily have given it away after  minutes but I persevered with itI only persevered for one reason I wanted to see what was probably Heath Ledgers last complete performance I rated his performance very highly and he deserves to be considered for any of the upcoming awards shows truly on meritI thought that Christian Bale was miscast and unconvincing as Batman and there really wasnt very much of a story line to the movie I cannot understand how this is rated a  out of  at present That must mean that all reviewers are between  and you are all giving it nine or ten Ten being the perfect score for the perfect movie I think some of you have let your emotions get away with youI scored it  out of ,Positive
Its the best superhero movie to date Amazing casting the cast played their parts with emotion Great framing lighting suspense and just everything about this movie is amazing,Positive
Just watched the batman and i had to go back to a movie actually worthy of praiseEverything about the dark knight is just great How the shots was made the music the tone of the movie and the underlying storymotive,Positive
Oh boy theres a reason why this movie is so popular ITS BRILLIANTRemarkable acting Heath Ledgers performance as Joker felt so realistic I totally enjoyed the chemistry between Joker and Batman in this movieWhat I didnt like was  how Harvey got his scarsit felt kinda rushed and the shaky cam is still there not so prominent as Batman Begins but still,Positive
Its hard to say that the Dark Knight is a bad movie After all its well acted well directed and deals with some heavyweight complex social and ethical issuesProblem is is that what you really wanted to see A drama A deadpan straightfaced humourless mostly actionfree drama I like dramas I really do Some of my favourite movies fall under the drama umbrella  Shawshank Shine Goodwill Hunting Once were warriors American History X The Assassination of Jesse James OndskanBut lets be honest with ourselves shall we Were sitting in the theatre watching a movie about a billionaire vigilante in a caped bat costume fighting a greenhaired clown How much dramarealism can you truly inject into that mix before you lose any and all sense of good entertainment Sadly not this much And Im at a complete loss as to how this movie got such a high IMDb rating  at the time of writing The only thing I can speculate is that an entire new generation of overenthusiastic and apparently very easilypleased youngsters just reached moviegoing age and skewed the results Go figure,Positive
Like I said The Dark Knight was the best movie I have watched Its my favourite movie I mean Christian Bale was the best Batman ever And Joker was also best Believe me both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger are best,Positive
A modern masterpiece of st Century Cinema The Dark Knight combines great direction with brilliant acting and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in why practical effects should not be a thing of the past and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right It serves as a comic book film but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality with one of the best villains of the last  years On top of that Christopher Nolans unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience,Positive
This film didnt spook me when i was young now with my adult brain this film is super intense and psychological The most amazing part is its never boring I didnt check my phone like i usually do This film made me jump i forgot about the joker killing the fake batmans offVery good film Better than no way home Im so glad my brain forgot about most of this film because it was like brand new to me And I LOVED IT SO MUCH,Positive
Everything in this movie is perfect Joker Heath ledger  nailed it I love the cinematography And nolans directing,Positive
This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as No doubt its good especially the tension and the performance of Heath Ledger but I never saw it as amazing Its far too long and there are plot holes large enough to drive the school bus through,Positive
Sorry guys but this doesnt belong in the top s by any account Its fight scenes car chases its effects and its storyline were all mostly average Momentum wasnt built up over the film at all and worse they dragged out scenes longer then they should haveIn fact this movie was in the top  list BEFORE it made it to cinema Why Because there are a few people who are overly enthusiastic about batman who used Heaths death as a marketing tool overhyped the movie and voted it upwards despite never having seen it Just because a movie is based on a comic shouldnt mean it should be voted any differently would anyone have liked this movie if Batmans costume was swapped Yes heath was good because he played something out of his general character similar to how Jim Carrey did in Spotless mind But and s should be reserved for movies which are completely innovative I felt like I saw this movie x already and nothing kept me hanging on to find out what happened next People who voted this  possibly need to experience movies such as the shining Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind Fight Club or even WallE These are movies which provide the watcher with a different experience then what they are accustomed too and they are left wondering what will happen next,Positive
I dont have one complaint about this movie I could watch it every day Has the perfect amount of action comedic relief suspense and drama Will always be a  from me,Positive
This movie is hands down one of the greatest films ever created Meticulously plotted boldly directed emotionally satisfying and grand in scale are just a few ways to describe this colossus of filmmaking Heath Ledger easily surpasses even the hype with a masterclass screen devouring performance Christian Bale Maggie Gyllenhaal Michael Caine Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are also incredibleYou need to see this movie at least once in your lifetime  go see it now,Positive
An excellent movie with an amazing performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker,Positive
The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mishmash lacking logic and cohesionTechnically the film is well made That is it looks and feels like a blockbuster though a solid score is sorely lackingOn the plus side Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensembleAnd sadly a fine actor will be remembered not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy but rather an excellent makeup job an overactive tongue and a silly voice As farewell performances rate Heath Ledgers Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu ManchuTo remind yourself how super hero movies should be made dust off your copy of Spiderman II from which it borrows or Superman The Movie from which it shouldve borrowed,Positive
Ill grant that you have to be fairly intellectual to understand this movie but its a masterpiece nonethelessHeath Ledger is incredible probably the greatest acting performance ever from a single actorI feel like the intellectual part comes in when you try to understand the characters I have read other reviews saying that the joker made no sense but in truth the darker you think of him the more sense he makesPlotholes are also very easily filled when paying attention to the film,Positive
A perfectly made movie with Heath Ledger at his best Batman Begins started the trend of darkserious movies and just when you thought a movie couldnt be better The Dark Knight came out with an outstanding performance by Heath LedgerAs much as you hate the Joker character in the movie in the end you truly feel bad Every scene hes in gets so intense with your eyes glued to the TV its really hard to get side tracked by thinking of something elseSadly The Dark Knight Rises wasnt that great this movie still stands as one of the best movies out there,Positive
I have just returned from a premiere in Newcastle Australia let me just say this has to be one of the best movies of Every performance in this movie is just fantastic and Heath Ledger Owns The JOKER I dont think anyone could match his style and he eats up every scene he is inThis has to be scene on the big screen to be enjoyed this is one of the very few sequels that is better than the originalMake  the year to see and enjoy one of the years bestAnd i hope in Feb  Heath is nominated for an Oscar he will always be remembered Cheers,Positive
This film is a magnificent piece of work which will likely not be rivaled for years to come The most well known antagonist in the Batman comics is undoubtedly the Joker and Heath Ledger portrays the necessary insanity and sadism perfectly Christian Bale as Batman leaves nothing more to be desired and every shot of Gotham city fills you with the mystery and dread that you would expect from a city littered with crime You can feel the sense that the city is not in a good state directly from the movies beginning and the Dark Knight of Gotham has to rise to the challenge The entire plot line will pull you deeper into the movie Every time that you think that a little scene is unimportant there is sudden relevance to the bigger picture to Gotham It is simply one of the best movies that I have ever seen and I feel that DC did it right with The Dark Knight not to say that earlier Batman movies failed to leave you wanting for more as they all did for me,Positive
"Nolans movies always are best
ive watched all of them
the dark knight was amazing",Positive
Everything about this film from the acting to the screenplay to the cinematography is just brilliant,Positive
Every characters story is perfectly told in one of Nolans greatest films ever made The actors were perfectly cast to one of the greatest set of characters Heath ledgers performance as the Joker is one of a kind and shows he was born to play the infamous role Christian Bale does a fantastic job in his continuation to play the caped crusaderThe film successfully tells the story of every character from Harvey Dent to the JokerThere wont be another film like it ,Positive
Please support my Kick Starter httpswwwkickstartercomprojectslurkanoriginstory Lurk an Origin Story Lurk an Origin Story is about a charismatic and often sarcastic thief who only steals from criminals He is a hero and saves the day However the public views him as a horrible vigilante who thinks himself above the law While on a mission one night Lurk is approached by a government agent who offers him a chance to be a hero The agent offers Lurk the opportunity to work alongside the US government Lurk teams with the government in order to help his reputation and the government hopes to build trust between the US citizens and themselves The government wants to turn Lurk into a symbol of purity and justice but they have a lot of work ahead of themselves,Positive
This Batman is played by one of the best actors such as Christan Bale Heath Ledger Morgan Freeman and other Heath Ledger is the best Joker ever In my opinion Christian Bale is the best Batman and without a doubt the best Bruce Wayne Those two are the best in their roles thats why this batman movie is memorable thats why its the most popular batman movie and the best rated In short whoever hasnt watch this Batman movie should watch it now before that watch Batman Begins and after this part of course this part also has its own continuation Batman The Dark Knight Rises All three parts are excellent but this one is the best,Positive
We have seen a lot of Super Hero movies but The Dark Knight is different from all other super hero movies that is Christopher Nolan I Wonder why they dont give an Oscar for Best Screenplay writing,Positive
If u ask me if any other super hero movie can have better plot than this one then ill say NO CrNOLAN as we all know is the best writer This movie has every thing A super hero a Badass smart villain a great story  some good acting Heath Ledgerjoker was awesome his acting was really remarkableFor me he was the best villain in the whole batman series Christian Balebatman is always good so no comments for him BATMAN is one of the most famous characters in DC comics so people have high expectations from this movieBut i assure you this movie will never disappoint you Joker is a villain with no super powers no advance gadgets but his intelligence is his greatest powerThis movie shows the real potential of joker  what he can do or how he creates fear in the mind of the people of whole Gotham city with only his intelligence  craziness The only thing is that this movie is a little bore in the start other wise this movie is very good  i would really love to watch it again  again,Positive
This is the Best Superhero movie Ive ever seen It even introduced me to Christopher Nolan and thus I watched Inception and Interstellar two of the best stories Ive ever seen And also Christian Bale his performance is most definitely the best Dark Knight performance out there,Positive
I think dark night was the best in batman trilogy for some reasonsAnd one of them was brilliant act of Heath Ledger In my opinion the way he acts makes the joker better than other movies and shows the joker more insane and more anarchist than ever So he was worthy of Oscar But sadly he was unable to receive it himselfBut I think it would be better if there was more scence of him in the movieAnd of course we dont have to forget about Christopher Nolan direction which makes this movie on the best cinematic creations,Positive
The best movie of Nolan above memento and inception I highlight above all the direction and photography of the film Its incredible what this direct does with a franchise that was in decline this trilogy is pure gold especially with this movie,Positive
This movie is one of the greatest films of all timeIt show so much symbolic messages and examples of morality that represents America in ,Positive
"VERY GOOD THIS FILM IS AWESOME
RECOMMEND THE USER VIEW THIS FILM",Positive
This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight Heath Ledger RIP was outstanding I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker As always the score the settings and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time  stars,Positive
The only negative I could give this movie is that the protagonist overshadows the main role of hero After all it is a batman movie But lets face it of all the good actors in the movie Heath Ledger blows everyone away with his role of the joker Not just for this movie but this may be one of the best acting roles in history The performance of his life  no pun intended  Its a shame he died there were more great performances in him sadly we will never see It would be a reasonable supposition to believe that ledgers performance may have been so extreme and brilliant due to psychological issues he was experiencing at the time which ultimately took his life A candle burning too bright and will be missed,Positive
Great Movie The most amazing Batman film ever After seeing this movie I was left speechlessThe performances from every actor and actress was amazing Just an excellent film a must movie to see It has ACTION It has LAUGHS It has HUMOR It has non stop ONE LINERS from the jokerIf any movie has deserved a perfect  this would be it Excellent work Thanks for thatThe most amazing Batman film ever After seeing this movie I was left speechlessThe performances from every actor and actress was amazing,Positive
The Dark Knight is a cinematic masterpiece that redefines the superhero genre Christopher Nolans direction masterfully weaves a gripping narrative filled with moral complexity and intense action Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is nothing short of extraordinary he embodies chaos with chilling charisma and depth creating an iconic villain that lingers long after the credits roll The films exploration of duality justice and sacrifice resonates deeply making it a profound experience With stunning visuals a haunting score and unforgettable performances The Dark Knight stands as a flawless triumph in filmmaking that elevates both its characters and its themes to unforgettable heights,Positive
This is one of those movies that you must watch it with one sit from the beginning to the end without making you lose any interest in it I also watched the continuation of this movie it wasnt bad at all there are few movies which i like to watch with one sit and they are really few i personally dont really like superhero movies that much but this one really got my attention i mean it has Christian Bale Batman in it of course it was going to be a really enjoying movie i recommend to anyone who have not watched the movie to see it really is an impressive one really sad that we can not have a joker like this one anymore i mean Heath Ledger Joker really hit that high joker performance he was and still is for me the best joker in a batman movie,Positive
Thats really oOosm  the acting of joker is op level His performance made us fall in love  changed peoples thought about villian Unfortunately he passed away before releasing of the film Its too sad because we could have watched him making another great movies and also gathering fame popularity         ,Positive
The movie showed how a real villain can cause this much chaos to the city And how he really pushed Batman to his edge yet not all of them are strong like Batam as some crossed the line The best movie that shows the two iconic figures Batman and Joker rival together,Positive
Heath Ledger will forever be the best joker ever and christian bale was a decent batman in my opinion,Positive
If youre interested in acting filmmaking or movies this is one of the greatest examples of all of that Whole Nolans trilogy is masterpiece But this second movie is probably the greatest one of them,Positive
The cinematography action and acting are good but the script is terrible Almost everything is predictable and the plot becomes increasingly unbelievable and illogical Overall I have to say that the film is okay at the beginning but becomes increasingly annoying as it progresses I wont watch it again,Positive
All you need to do is switch this film on for  seconds and your hooked Simple,Positive
Oh what a film  This movie is a towering achievement in the superhero genre pushing the boundaries of storytelling and redefining what a comic book adaptation can be Christopher Nolans direction is masterful creating a dark and gritty atmosphere that perfectly complements the complex themes explored in the film Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is truly mesmerizing and unforgettable earning him a posthumous Academy Award The films thoughtprovoking exploration of morality chaos and the nature of heroism makes it a standout in the genre Its a mustwatch for any fan of superhero movies or thrilling thoughtprovoking cinema Dont miss out on this epic Batman adventure ,Positive
The movie is an extraordinary piece of the filmmaking art in all its aspects the plot is carefully and smartly written as a intricately wrought canvas the character development is very satisfying the movie was shot well and nicely directed the epic score fits the scenes and add up to the whole visual experience the acting was intense by all cast where each fit their role perfectly specially Heath Ledger who managed after all these years of having the Joker around in comic books animations TV series and even movies to literally bring this complicated character with all its twisted brilliant sadistic dark and sometimes funny personality to live on the big screen,Positive
Great and worth to watch The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made,Positive
Film director Nolan really is crossed with this  I work One teacher nail Batman saga That hardly could be overcomeGreat Performance Bale But especially WAS Ledger Performance Awesome Acting taught her role  sin Being doubt the best Joker everBoth the script as the Directorate of Film Were majestic  the A taste mas I WAS watching a UN Batman Find complexed sin Power Solution A  A dark film Big Labor The Solo Movie UNOS has small Minor Mistakes That Almost pass unnoticedBale is a sin to doubt my favorite actor Nolan has earned my His work favoritism For large esta saga But especially for the Part II What is thisI say goodbye and thanking the Work Done That the great cast Create esta could work together ,Positive
The film was very disappointing Firstly Heath Ledger wow didnt see that coming He was terrific From A knights tale to the dark knight not the same actor surely The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed I am going to compare this to the  film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make The  film was entertaining this wasnt It was too dark too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isnt the aim of comics Christian Bales voice as Batman was ridiculous I didnt have any empathy with his character at all didnt feel for him just nothing Thought that I wouldnt want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia Though I appreciate the lack of CGI very refreshing and the last half an hour of the film i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained This was just depressing Cant understand why this is considered to be the third best film of all time on IMDb astounding,Positive
This is by far the most over rated film of all time it dose not deserve a place on the top  list in my opinion not even the top ,Positive
I love the Batman movies They have a lot of fantastic elements which include action which is perfected,Positive
Heath ledgers character the joker is phenomenal One of the best acting performances ever The dark night is a great movie but not the best Not in the top  Its Avery good movie with a thrilling story but it is a bit overrated This movie never really gets old And the story of heath ledger and the joker role pushing his mental state further Heath ledger unfortunately killed himself after the role Dont get me wrong the dark knight is a great excellent movie but it shouldnt be the top  of the world even nearly the top  But the dark knight is the best sequel for a Christopher Nolan movie ever Thank you Christopher Nolan for making the greatest superhero movie of all time,Positive
This is a fantastic entry into Christopher Nolans trilogy Have watched this probably around  times over the past  years and it never gets boring,Positive
Im convinced Heath Ledger was insane and was a reallife psychopath Theres just no way he could put off a performance like that being sane of mind The fear his character introduced in me could not be matched Its intensity wowThe plot is amazing perfectly scripted by Nolan all connected amazing The torture that the Joker creates is perfectly executedThe messages the movie creates are amazing how we can save everybody The ending is wow just wow a great culmination to a masterful filmAnd some parts of the movies will just stay in my mind forever for how iconic it is All the action sequences the interrogation All awesomeMy top  movies of all time,Positive
I would say best film related to superhero for was last film with popular superhero I was able to watch without getting bored Now day most of the stories are dreadful The screenplay penned by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan is a triumph of storytelling The films plot is intricate and multilayered exploring themes of chaos morality and the nature of heroism It challenges both its characters and the audience to grapple with difficult questions making it a cerebral experience within the superhero genreIn a world inundated with superhero films The Dark Knight remains a shining beacon of storytelling excellence,Positive
Iconic The Dark Knight directed by Christopher Nolan is a cinematic tour de force that redefines the superhero genre Released in  this film stands as a testament to the transformative power of storytelling and the impact of exceptional performances At its core Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary Ledgers posthumous Academy Awardwinning performance elevates the character beyond a mere antagonist making the Joker a symbol of chaotic brilliance and anarchyChristian Bale reprising his role as Bruce WayneBatman brings a brooding intensity that complements the films exploration of duality and morality Nolans direction is masterful creating a gritty and realistic Gotham City that becomes a character in itself The cinematography coupled with Hans Zimmers haunting score adds layers of tension and depth to the narrativeThe Dark Knight transcends the typical superhero narrative evolving into a crime thriller that delves into the complexities of heroism The films social commentary on the thin line between order and chaos resonates throughout challenging audiences intellectually and emotionally As the capstone of Nolans Batman trilogy The Dark Knight sets a high standard with its thoughtprovoking narrative exceptional performances and cinematic brillianceThis film isnt just a comic book adaptation its a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll Its impact on the superhero genre is undeniable and its legacy continues to influence filmmakers setting a standard that few have matched The Dark Knight remains a beacon of excellence reminding us that a superhero film can be both entertaining and intellectually stimulating leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern filmmaking,Positive
Christopher Nolan Heath Ledger outstanding combo plus christian Bale is amazing but the villain stole the light and took a standing ovation by the world Joker is the real trump card of this movie and the best until now,Positive
So I know Im not supposed to dislike a movie like this especially since Heath Ledger acts so well but Ive seen this film several times Ive given it its due but honestly its not good The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics The phone call scene  are u fing kidding me Its so outlandish that its annoying And the ferries  Common I know its a fantasy but the whole social experiment  is so stupid Arggg I hate this film Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance I know everyone loved this film but honestly its badreally bad Hard pass,Positive
It was really a beautiful movie in the genre of mystery and action which keeps the viewer glued to the TV Batman was a person with character Joker played one of the best negative roles in the world and was seen a lot and won an award at the Oscar cWith this movie you will find a new attitude about cinemaeremonyI suggest that you watch this movie with all its excitement because you are watching one of the best movies in history I promise you Always watching such movies teaches you many positive and negative points and this world needs such movies About Christopher Nolan who is the director of this unique movie there is no more to say because he is an expert director throughout history I hope you enjoy watching this movie,Positive
I love it There was so much here and I particularly loved this take on the Joker,Positive
This movie is very blockbuster of Christopher nolan and i like this movie so much And this movie everybody like this because christian bale nailed it in this movie and its better than robert pattisons movie named batman Some scenes in this movie is mindblowing and crazy i really like this movie The villain in this character is very fantastic and awesome roleplay of villain And im giving this movie as  Christopher nolan choose the right character of hero and im surprised and everyone in youtube got viral and lots of moments and everybody should watch this movie its very amazing,Positive

RIP",Positive
OK lets get it out of the way Im a massive Batman fan I loved the TV show when I was a kid really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions Ive even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one So how come Ive just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed Why Because this film just wasnt that good Its far too long has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously its painful The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought The whole thing was one great big dreadful noisy mess The only good thing in it is Heath Ledgers performance I had my doubts when I first heard whod theyd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath he pulled it off No thanks to the film however which is so over cooked its burnt Sure theres loads of action cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul It was great looking but has no personality I felt neither happy scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained I really didnt give a damn So next time people slim it down less is more Its not Apocalypse Now put some fun into itWhy so serious,Positive

Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight isnt merely a superhero movie its a magnum opus that redefines the genre At its core is Heath Ledgers haunting portrayal of the Joker a character study that delves into the darkest corners of human psyche Ledgers performance is a revelation crafting a Joker that is simultaneously terrifying and captivatingChristian Bales BatmanBruce Wayne is equally compelling showcasing the internal struggle of a hero burdened by his sense of duty and the blurred line between justice and vengeance The supporting cast including Aaron Eckhart Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman deliver exceptional performances adding layers of complexity to the narrativeNolans direction is nothing short of genius transforming Gotham City into a character itselfa gritty sprawling urban landscape plagued by crime and corruption The films action sequences are meticulously choreographed and the practical effects create a visceral sense of realism rarely seen in superhero filmsWhat sets The Dark Knight apart is its exploration of moral ambiguity and the choices that define us The film raises profound questions about society justice and the nature of good and evil challenging the audiences perceptions long after the credits roll Hans Zimmers score is the soul of the movie underscoring the tension and emotion with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrackIn conclusion The Dark Knight is a cinematic triumph that continues to captivate audiences worldwide Its exceptional performances intricate storytelling and thoughtprovoking themes elevate it to the realm of timeless classics A film that lingers in the mind and demands multiple viewings The Dark Knight stands as a testament to the power of storytelling and remains an essential watch for anyone seeking profound cinematic experiences,Positive
 yes complex ambitious Christopher Nolan and his cowriter Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation I dont usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence The Dark Knight is certainly loud and violent but its not mindless It has depth and soul Even the Joker in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger is deeply human The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself in screen time is not really the lead My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret I believe is his obvious respect for his audience What hes done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions Bravo,Positive
The Dark Knight is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the superhero genre Christopher Nolans direction coupled with Heath Ledgers iconic portrayal of the Joker delivers a dark and gripping narrative The films intense action sequences moral complexity and stellar performances especially by Christian Bale as Batman make it a timeless classic Hans Zimmers haunting score adds to the tension creating an immersive experience The Dark Knight stands out as one of the greatest superhero films offering a compelling storyline complex characters and a perfect balance of darkness and heroism,Positive
I really enjoyed this movie Plot cast production everything is on point If you havent seen The Dark Knight you should Some say its overrated no its not It deserves its rating and its rank in the top rated IMDB movies of all time,Positive
Outstanding academic essay for scholars and they are you from the,Positive
Stellar proformence from every actoractress Heath ledger was truly a fantastic actor and no one will ever top his joker if you are into super hero movies or really any movie I believe you will love this one I highly recommend,Positive
Joker was absolutely amazing Simply a must see film for anyone who wishes to see the best joker performance,Positive
Honestly amazing  watch it all the time Really good Love a good thriller Simply one of those films where you turn off the lights grab some popcorn and enjoy Characters all work amazingly well story is structured fantstiscally and I often tend to rewatch on repeat If it was on youtube I am sure my viewings would take it into the high millions Would watch over and over it is a film to rav about The story works so well so fresh and gripping I think it deserves more recognistion and loads more awards Please rerelease in cinema It would be amazing to experience it again and have that moment,Positive
Where do I even begin First of all this movie has the best plot and the best characters in cinema history Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intresstingNolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense We got the best angles and the feelings that emerged from watching this movie gave me goosebumpsThis is literally the best movie out there and a person needs to have this movie in his or hers watchlist Seriously this is a movie where you dont even think about checking the time on your phone because you are literally soooo invested in the story,Positive
Amazing movie by Nolan could not make a more real version of Bats and Joker,Positive
This is the future comic book adaptations are headed THEN WATCHMEGO What a sucker punch I had such a big hopes mostly because of the hype created by people who invested millions into this flop that it really hurts me to say the biggest disappointment in  was this movie Although I still cant say it was the worst There is nobody I can warn about this movie since I was probably the last person to see it on the earth ButMan to see a great franchise falling this low Millions of dollars spent on this movie could have ended the poverty on this world and I couldnt see anything to justify the spending For example the batcave in this movie is an undecorated plain underground garage Fhuy Batman costumes always were lacking behind other super heros outfit however for what they used here I have to admit I seen better on some kids showing up at my doorstep for Halloween Not to mention it was so uncomfortable that Christian B couldnt even move properly in itheck he couldnt even speak properly in it so all the fight scenes were TERRIBLE hidden in dark or under a stroboscope light How about the gay cowboy licking his mouth every  seconds scary try Retarded No offense Imitating raw home made camera footage once invented by Blair Witch Project in a Newsbreak part was when I almost smashed my TV Again where the money went in this filmIll tell You where Paying all the critics for a few favorable words Shame on You HollywoodSure Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher versions were OverTheTop ButMan did I love their use of colors and mood it was a visual treatDark Knight was it a bad movie No it wasnt Disappointment You betchaaLong Live Jack Nicholson,Positive
This is a movie which deserves more than review O ly two word enough to explain  Almost PerfectThe job is perfect you can see the sweet of cristopher nolan in the every part of movie There is a huge work behind this masterpiece It has a well originated story and it has been empowered with the top class actingBest batman casting so farIt is the best till the nolan decide to direct better batman movie,Positive
Acting is perfect Storyline is fantastic Overall an incredible instalment in the Batman trilogy,Positive
I believe this is one of of the greatest films of all time I know that people wont have the same opinion or view as me but I fail to find anything wrong with the film other than I wish it was longer and it just didnt have to end,Positive
Cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genreThis film delivers a gripping narrative intense action sequences and unforgettable performances that leave a lasting impact on viewersAlso raises thoughtprovoking questions about the nature of morality the price of vigilantism and the fragility of society Its a film that challenges viewers to confront their own beliefs and ideals making it a truly unforgettable cinematic experienceHeath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker in The Dark Knight is nothing short of mesmerizing Ledgers interpretation of the iconic Batman villain is chilling captivating and downright unforgettable From his menacing smile to his haunting laugh Ledger fully embodies the madness and unpredictability of the character,Positive
Hands down the best Batman that is and will ever be This is one of my favorite movies because of the three main characters Bruce WayneBatman Harvey DentTwo Face and The Joker Each character is different yet alike in so many ways and throughout the movie you to see why they become who they are Christopher Nolan did a fantastic job directing this movie and this will be a movie that many generations to come will enjoy Christian Bale is such a complex actor and you really see his character change so much from Batman Begins and you really see it in the ending scene of the movie He in my opinion is one of the best actors in the business and i dont think anyone will ever come close Throughout his movies you see all of the different roles he has taken and it is pretty amazing to see how talented he really is Hope to see Christian Bale win more Academy Awards because he is very deserving of them ,Positive
Not perfect but too good Definitely the best superhero movie made till now,Positive
I have seen the Dark Knight multiple times but still love to see it sometimes when i got nothing to do The movie is still powerfull and full of suprises The story line is very good it has multiple stories that are bend togheter in different stages of the movie That makes the movie atrractive to watch even if you already have seen itThere is plenty of action with nice realistic combat scenes The evil Joker is a solid opponent versus batman I liked the psychological deepness that is showed in different stages inside the story That makes the movie als interesting for more intelligent peopleBesides batman and the joker there are three other major roles You can almost choose witch character you like the most But watch out it can be devastating for you in the endAll by all a solid  You wont see movies like this much these days,Positive
Glad to see Im not the only one who didnt like The Dark Knight I can step back and objectively say it was a good movie on some levels the performances overthetop entertainment etc But the bottom line is I hated it Loud obnoxious pointless and soulless Who are these awful people Heath Ledger immersed himself into the role of the Joker and it was impressive Hes fascinating to watch But what is the point of his character At least Jack Nicholson was humorous in the role Heaths joker is just a train wreck psychopath with absolutely no redeeming value I dont get the point Why do we find these despicable characters entertaining are we that desperateI was disappointed in Christian Bale too He is one of the best actors working today but this time he was kind of flat I thought he was better in Batman Begins This entire movie is just so overthetop explosions wow an explosion thats new the cool looking but ridiculous motorcycle the millionth chase scene repulsive characters like TwoFace and on and on Weve seen it all so movie makers have to go to extreme lengths to entertain us jaded moviegoers and this loud obnoxious trash is the result We really are getting desperateI usually agree with IMDb more or less the ratings are usually reliable But right now this is  come on could we please settle down on the hyperbole with this movie Im not hating it on purpose because of the hype I liked Iron Man and that got hyped I liked the Wrestler and that got hyped But this nightmare of a movie needs a backlash,Positive
I loved this movie I can literally watch it over and over again Heath Leger was the best Joker that has every been played I love the whole cast,Positive
Heath Ledger is the star of the show but the acting in the move is great on all sides The pacing the sets the music is wonderfully shot and make you sad when the end credits start to roll This is the type of movie that I try to watch at least once a year It also cemented my option of Christopher Nolan as one of the great directors of the current generation It would have been amazing to see where Heath Ledger could have gone in his career based on his iconic performance in this movie Nitpicks Christian Bales voice changes are a little odd and I dont know if they are necessary for the movie to get its point across,Positive
The Dark Knight is one of those movies that resonate in people so much that they are a true and avid believer in the Joker  Batman himself It is one of the best movies I have ever seen The only way the joker can see himself as credible is if he does things his way without hesitation The Batman is his nemesis  does everything he can to stop him The bat mobile is the perfect example of why the cutting edge tech in this movie is still viable to this day and the future ahead I see myself in the Joker and I also see myself in the Batman Much training was necessary for the Batman to fully evolve into the walking batsuited mastermind himself The Joker will always be remembered as the villain  Batman will always be there to save the night,Positive
This may seem like faint praise but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didnt even realize it was a superhero movie,Positive
I am not a huge Batman fan But I finally watched this like  years later  I was hoping for Darker but for a Batman movie it was action packed It was like Point Break in Gotham but was entertaining Ledger was good but not the hype performance everyone freaked about Good Joker but he didnt scare me I want joker to creep me TF out and fear his wrath OH well Good movie totally worth watching I think Bale is a good Batman but I really like Keaton I wonder what a new Tim Burton remake would look like with all of the CGI available now that was not around when he made the first Batman with Keaton I say we petition that Get Burton on another really dark one But please please please No Ben AfleckHappy Watching,Positive
Cast  perfect so good that even the supporting roles were perfectly played Everything matched like a puzzle Even the director Nolan The movie was cast by stars Those stars soon turned into superstars who now get recognized easily whenever they show up on a screen Even the butler broStory  How How the hell do these people do this Ive watched so many movies listened to so many songs lived through so many lives But this story is just so perfectly beautiful From bank robbery to international fraud to superhero tech to a choose one type scenario with such an unexpected twist dam this one was goodScript  Some men just want to watch the world burn  I dont know if this is a spoiler but the butler says that broOverall  must watch movie Much needed for the DC scene Makes an Asian guy want to be the next Batman tbh,Positive
Whenever i watch this film it takes me to another level of creativity Movie makes me more powerful than ever,Positive
The Dark Knight was most definitely one of the better movies Ive had the pleasure of viewing and it did not fail to meet any preconceived notions or ideas which I formed already Everything from the phenomenal performance of the gifted set of actors to the amazing stunts and action executed was beautifully and concisely produced Starting with the actors and their performance I believe that Heath Ledger was the best Joker the Batman Universe has yet to see his expressed nuances and habits that he evokes to portray the Joker are something to be marveled In one of the most famous scenes of not just the movie but of cinematic history Heath Ledger poses the question to a mob leader while holding him at knife point Why so serious Heath Ledger was one of the best casting jobs of the movie Another good casting job of the movie is of Christian Bales He plays Bruce Wayne Batman in The Dark Knight and he brings the mystery and reclusiveness and charisma that he embodies as both personalities However while I sing praises of the movie thus far I dont feel as though it deserves a  of  as a score There is a little amount of movie material that can be considered worthy of such a score and The Dark Knight is no exception At some points in the movie the plot revolves more around the technology that has been developed and it would have been a better movie to explore and ascertain Bruce WaynesBatmans loyalty and moral character and how both characters find a growth of personal morality and justice,Positive
One word Amazing Not much to say besides thatChristopher Nolan brings us a new Batman against joker story that takes the title for bestThe idea that Batman cant do anything The idea that joker is the best criminalHeath Ledger was amazingYoure on the edge of your seat the entire timeThere are only two things Im complaining about and that stopped me from rating it a  When Batman is going to save Rachel he couldve saved both by sending teams out each way to each location but he didnt Why Harvey Dent blames Batman for the death of Rachel Why He knows perfectly well that Batman is at least trying to be the hero here So when Batman tells him to point the gun at the people responsible why the heck does he point it at BatmanOtherwise this film is if not the best one of the best films Nolan has brought us ,Positive
There is a reason i gave this movie a  out of  There is nothing to improve upon such a classic and a fun time to watch it even more than once,Positive
Although the Batman is not longer young he can change the world to become better I am looking forward to the next one next fantastic one,Positive
In The Dark Night Movie Joker in this movie is really a legend He is my favorite Character in this movie more then the Hero The Hero is the Batmen but most famous character is the joker the way he presents his character is mind blowing i always gonna miss his acting i wish he is alive so i can see him in more movies and more shades of characters Batmen is a Super hero but Joker is a Super Villain of all time Nolan is a great filmmaker who knows the core of emotions and character design his script and dialogues are amazing he is one of the best filmmaker of this century Many filmmakers learn filmmaking from his style,Positive
He really makes this movie His joker is iconic truly a bar to reach for for all other actors,Positive
Heath Heath Heath yada yada yada Yes he did a lovely Joker So what The film was almost as tedious as the rest of them The obvious problems Too long Shallow stabs at moral seriousness Absurdly overprocessed Batman voice The usual barelythere female characters Heaths Joker was just another lunatic villain and weve seen plenty of similar quality over the years gasp  heresyYes in my opinion Heath was merely okayMaking a villainous virtue out of the Joker having no purpose but to make the world burn is not deep Its not that hard to create a charismatic psycho character Yes he had some game Yes of course I enjoyed lines like I wouldnt know what to do with it if I caught one This movie wasnt completely awful Im giving it five stars after all which guarantees no one will read my comment but oh wellBut neither Heath nor the film as a whole was amazingIm not a superhero movie hater and Ive actually read plenty of Batman comics in my life unlike at least half the people getting excited about this film I think But I have been bored and disappointed by the Batman franchise films every time so this is no surprise I cant even wrap my head around this one being fun light entertainment or any other kind of entertainment let alone a classic as so many are calling itA classic As GOB would say Come on If you are calling this movie a classic you cant possibly have seen many movies,Positive
The buzz from the entire media and the general public made it sound like this was the second coming of Star Wars Well it wasnt A matter of fact this way over hyped pile of garbage is one of the worse movies i have seen in years Where to begin Lets start with the so called great acting You must be kidding me Ledger does not deserve an Oscar nomination for this If anything Jack Nicholson does a far better job playing the Joker Christian Bale basically mumbles through most of his Bat man parts and isnt much better when he isnt Plot is stupid as heck They make the Joker sound like some super human beast from another world A dozen officers with machine guns would of killed him off in  seconds But i guess that would of ruined the story line Any way you analyze this movie Its just plain old bad,Positive
when I gave my opinion with  marks I was not give it for the movie or for Christian Bale or for director but only for Heath Ledger who made A wonderful performancehe was able to delve deeper into this character really with loud voice and A great honor I want to say BRAVOOOOOOO But in general the story was amazing especially in last minutesand as always Morgan Freeman Was scintillating and Maggie Gyllenhaal also finally I believe that without Heath Ledger and his performance this movie was not take more than  because he was the secret of success thanks Heath Ledger and we will not forget you and your fantastic performance,Positive
Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly blends intense action profound storytelling and unforgettable performances Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of mesmerizing elevating the film to unparalleled heights Nolans direction coupled with Hans Zimmers iconic score creates a dark and immersive atmosphere that captivates audiences from start to finish The films exploration of morality and the complexities of heroism cements its status as a modern masterpiece in the superhero genreNolans visionary storytelling and Bales compelling Batman make The Dark Knight a timeless masterpiece,Positive
The Dark Knights alleys covered in the shadow needles and trash on the pavement and lunatic clown blowing up half of the city is all i was expecting from the film portraying BatmanJoker relationship Heath Ledgers role is making me anxious and thats a proof of well played character He is unpredictable brutal and savage just mental It may not be the Joker we know from the comics but for me its the best version of the Clown we ever saw on screen Usage of the darkness and shadow is what others cantake example from The movie has a good pace there is a lot of actiongoing on but it isnt too much It is a perfect balance between action and dialog which is hard to obtain Overall it is definitelly the best Batman movie ever made,Positive
The Dark Knight is a trilogy movie that I watch and re watch a lot of times Full of action great cinematography amazing pacing on the editing side and storytelling wise is just flawless I can say that my favorite of the  is the second one with Joker just amazingFor me the best Batman out there,Positive
Batman The Dark Knight is an absolute masterpiece that transcends the superhero genre and stands as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all timeOne of the most remarkable aspects of this film is Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker Ledgers portrayal of the iconic villain is nothing short of mesmerizing He completely disappears into the character delivering a chilling and unforgettable performance Ledgers Joker is chaotic unpredictable and utterly compelling His every scene is a masterclass in acting and its no surprise that he posthumously won an Academy Award for his roleChristian Bale continues to excel as Bruce WayneBatman His brooding intensity and unwavering commitment to the role make him one of the most compelling Batman interpretations to date Bales dedication to his craft is evident in every scene and he brings a complex depth to the characterAaron Eckharts portrayal of Harvey DentTwoFace is another standout performance His transformation from a principled district attorney to a vengeful and disfigured villain is handled with nuance and skill Its a tragic arc that adds emotional weight to the filmThe films screenplay penned by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan is a triumph of storytelling It weaves together multiple plot threads themes of morality chaos and the nature of heroism and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish The dialogue is sharp and thoughtprovoking and the pacing is impeccable,Positive
Christopher Nolans dark knight is still one of the best superhero movies if not the bestI think this is the first movie that villain become more attracted by Fans more than the herohe really gives the better class of criminal the movie needed It is a good combination of good action and awesome storyline,Positive
After seeing the dark Knight thousand time I think this movie is Great its been more than  years was made this movie but until now I see how great it is not because how good is Heath Ledger in joker character but the action scene was really good and how they film it,Positive
This was a nearperfect masterpiece its what Marvel wishes it could do The movie had tons of action scenes and a great storyline it had the best Joker of all time Ledgers approach to Joker wasnt the corny s Joker where he was making corny cartoon jokes Ledgers joker was a psychological joker that messed with peoples minds and had them looking in every which direction Bale was phenomenal he was an incredible Bruce Wayne was disappointed that the original Rachel dropped the movie though It was an amazing experience to watch this movie  would recommend anyone to watch this movie if they would like to be entertained for  hours its worth itRIP Health Ledger you were gone too soon,Positive
The world of superheroes has always been captivated by largerthanlife characters but none have left as indelible a mark on pop culture as the iconic Dark Knight Batman a character beloved for his complex persona and thrilling adventures has been brought to life in various mediums but with the latest film its clear that the Caped Crusader has found a new home on the big screen The  Batman film directed by visionary filmmaker David Fincher is a visual masterpiece that brings this iconic character to life in ways that have never been seen beforeFor someone like me whose introduction to Batman came through animated series and comics this film was a thrilling revelation I was initially drawn to the character through the brilliant Batman The Animated Series and various comic books However seeing Batman in a liveaction setting enhanced by stateoftheart visual effects VFX was a gamechanger The film takes the characters appeal and magnifies it creating a cinematic experience that is as thrilling as it is visually stunningThe supporting cast is equally impressive Selina Kyle portrayed by a charismatic actress embodies the complex and enigmatic Catwoman Her chemistry with Batman is palpable and their dynamic adds depth to the story The film also introduces a formidable antagonist in the form of the Riddler played by an actor who brings a chilling and intellectual malevolence to the character The way the Riddlers elaborate puzzles and clues are woven into the narrative keeps the audience engaged in a thrilling and suspenseful mystery Whether youre a longtime Batman aficionado or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City this film is a mustsee Batmans legend has never shone brighter on the silver screen,Positive
This is the best superhero film to date Heath Ledger has one of the best performances of all time and the entire story is so captivating The Joker is horrifying and hes a great challenge for Batman If you havent seen the Dark Knight and you are a superhero fan you better rethink whether you are actually a superhero fan,Positive
"Love it Every bit of itA top notch superhero movie genuinely lost words
so I had this in my thoughts for hourThis movie wasnt supposed to be like this
far enough to deserves the good ratings
because the intentions of this movie its simply to fight Joker the main villainBut this one hits different with Nolans vision that wanted to show us the real persona of whom the Dark Knight really isThe messages that this movie have really determine the true words that never told before that makes you truly appreciate Bruce Wayne as a person and Batman as a Dark Knight that Gotham needsWatched every DCs movies this week this one is trully the greatest ever made",Positive
Great superhero movieI think this is the best Batman movie that has been created so far The leading actor who plays the Joker is believeable and draws you into the movie The storyline was well put together and award worthy,Positive
Okay so they built a good villain in the Joker but the plot was just a bit too unbelievable to hold together Im not going to add any spoilers here but if you want a bigbudget action adventure escape that totally relies on the rendering farms that had to handle all the special effects and dont mind plotholes the Hindenburg could fly through this film is for you IMHO this film doesnt deserve all the hype Look at reviews from people who hated it and see why Once the hype has died down and people get over their brainwash to overrate this overproduced Hollywood crap we should see ratings more in line with the films true value I didnt walk out but that was because I had such high expectations Id hope to see this rated a  maybe even as high as a  by the average public Im rating this a  to try to offset the obvious shills and excessive hype This is by no means the best film of the summer but in its favor it does give better balance to the darkness of Batman If it werent for the growing trend in bucking the old feelgood Hollywood ending routine if it werent becoming clich to kill off good guys and create characters with seeming hearts of gold who turn halfevil Id say this film had something unique but that whole scenario is now a formula for making a film armchair critics will say has depth pffff Save your time and money and rent an old classic favorite that you somehow never managed to see Or go have a picnic with your loved ones The alternative is twoandahalf hours you wont get back dont waste it to further enrich Warner Bros,Positive
This movie is awesome So many batman secrets unleashedI am terrified You all should watch this,Positive
Christian bale was great acting as Batman  However  Heath ledger performance as joker is a masterpiece no one will ever top him deservedRip Heath ledger greatest performance in film history,Positive
This movie is like a rollercoaster the acting of Heath Ledger elevates the movie but Bale doesnt dissapoint no one is bad the action is sooo gooooddd you cant even blink in this movie the duo of Batman  Joker is so well crafted its an antagonistprotagonist relation that develops both especially the protagonist The ending is absolutely peak it gives you that sour felling but also hopeful just absolutely peak but you should watch Batman Begins first its possible to enjoy The Dark Knight without watching it but with Begins its even betterConclusion Watch it its peak absolutely peak,Positive
This movie has gotta have the best eerie soundtrack Batman is so fun to watch and is my favorite character ever since I was just only  years old Id do anything I can to be the next big movie star for a big role like batman This trilogy is hands down the best thing ever to any superhero movie I loved how Christian Bale played the role of Batman so well where we as the audience thinks that Christians role actually suits his personal I can promise you that even our own president of the United States at one point Including the Audience was definitely wanting to be Batman Us as the Audience can say the same,Positive
I really liked the acting skills of Heath Ledger who had played the role of Joker in this movie Joker has his own rules in this Batman movie I always watch this movie along with my best buddy Peter This movie has inspired many people and if you are a fan of Batman then this movie is for you,Positive
For as much action as there is in this movie its the acting that makes it a great piece of work Between all the explosions and stuntwork is some great dialog work All the actors have their momentsPerfect directing perfect story perfect balance between action and drama everything is perfectexcellent movie ever the joker character was outstanding the heath ledger gives excellent performance in this movieand the best music work by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howardthis is a blockbuster movie of GENIUS AT WORK by Christopher NolanThe Dark Knight gets a MASTERPIECE  of  stars,Positive
This Movie for sure made me see batman in a different light after all he is a human and has no super powers but it just shows that you dont need super powers to be a super hero I really liked the action in this particular film compared to the other batman films Christan Bale did a great job as batman and is possibly my preferred batman overall in the batman series Pretty soon the new batman vs Superman will be coming out although I myself am not really a DC fan I am definitely going to be seeing that after I watch Marvels Captain America World At War maybe after seeing Batman VS Superman I may convert into a DC fan and after seeing pictures of the movie that is a very likely chance,Positive
Acting great story great one of the best jokers that the big screen has ever seen,Positive
Seeing it rated as the third best movie of all time by IMDb voters and ranking up huge box office I thought Id give it a swingI mostly wish I hadnt bothered Like most superhero movies nowadays its one gigantic battleship of a movie weighed down by its humongous budget and massive running time How many subplots do we need How many conflicted characters staring into the depths of their pompous souls Visually  great And the vfx crew have to be credited for some of the most seamless and impressive work ever done on the city the batmobile the bat bike etc Brilliant stuffBut the story the script the pacing  all pretty blaah Did I give a damn about any of the characters Did I really care what was going to happen next Nope Did I actually know what was going on half the time what with the various criminals their money the money laundering guy the Joker the various Police Departments what the hell is County No no no Boring I was actually looking at my watchThe one intriguing episode in the film  with the ferries  is shoved in three quarters of the way through the film and unceremoniously dumped once it has served its purpose in sticking other bits of the film togetherSo all in all I wish Id spent the time some other way,Positive
I watched alot of other batman movies especially the newest batmanI still have to say that no one can beat the class of christian BaleI love it so much and i have watched it again and again,Positive
Nollan brings us a Batman that is totally real and possible Any thing happening in this movie is possible to happen of screen Batman has no super powers we all know either do the villains Batman is a man using technology and intelligence as a base for his skills Every line in the movie is plausible The casting is flawless quite well selected in entire trilogy Christian Bale show his chameleon skills going from Bruce to Batman as fast and certain as you can flip a coin Tha usually romantic Aaron Eckheart is also broken in two and instead of switching from edges he mergeem resulting in the only Harvey Two Face in the cinema that could be taken seriously Heath Leadger acting is one of the most amazing things you could see in your entire life It makes you wonder Jack Nicholson who This is the kind of movie that plays on my screen every once in a while,Positive
This tital was my good tital wish if i would be like the confidently directed with a complex story,Positive
Theres one thing about The Dark Knight that I just dont get why Why do so much people make it out to be something that its not I dont call it a masterpiece for enough reasons I didnt find it gripping and I thought it was schmaltzy as hell just like all the movies I see these days  Sure it was good but its not a masterpiece because I dont call it groundbreaking despite the fact that it made a helluva lot of money and was the biggestgrossing movie of  Honestly even Ive seen better and Im almost  I dont think its the kind of movie that leaves a mark on the worldwide consciousness and it doesnt mean much to me personally It was WAY WAY overanticipatedI honestly dont know if theres any ground left to break but sure we can still show audiences that artistry and business shouldnt be two different things Id really like to see Hollywood do more stuff like that Bottom line what was good back in the Golden Age is still good now I think both the American people and people all over the world can still handle craftsmanship I gave the movie  stars out of  just to be generousId love to see someone pull it off but I dont know if theyd have the gutsTo call The Dark Knight a masterpiece is to say that the viewer clearly has not seen a wide range of filmsYou wanna know what a real masterpiece is Give  A Space Odyssey the first two Star Wars films Casablanca The Wizard of Oz or the first two Indiana Jones films a try and think about it,Positive
This film is basically averageNONE of the performances in this film are anything worth getting over exited about Heath Ledgers performance was good It wasnt amazing it wasnt even great Just like Ian Curtis his death did him the world of good Im not saying he wasnt a capable actor Im simply saying he wasnt anything specialHave we reached an age where licking your lips and snuffling is regarded as a performance that should earn him every award known to manHe is only regarded as being so super good because hes dead  simple as thatWatch Tim Burtons Batman its a better film,Positive
Absolutely one of the best films I have ever seen The Joker and Batman fantastically portrayed by Heath and Christian with phenomenal chemistry between the characters Over a decade on since it was released and countless superhero watched by myself since and this is still definitely the best one out there The depth and rationalities the joker gives leave the viewer wondering whether he is crazy or completely sane in this thought provoking cinematic masterpieceNo spoilers here but when you watch it you will be on the edge of your seat with anticipation you will also feel so connected to both the joker and batman on an emotional level,Positive
Ive lost count of how many times i have watched this Returned to it after watching Joker Different interpretation but Ledgers Joker is perfection,Positive
Feel that this movie is simply beautiful I dont mind the fact that it is long about  and a half hours but what if it is the perfect movie from experience I went to see it at the cinema and since then I have seen few Sometimes so as not to get bored with her but I remember her as a damn exam man and as Gordon says at the end hes a hero but that we dont need now  the Dark Knight ufff and that soundtrack  papa buenisimooooo and finally  HE IS BATMAN,Positive
This isnt just a fancy superhero movieIts beyond that It deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it Putting aside the plot and the taking the performances of everyone involved in the movie are beyond excellenceChristopher Nolan is as usual at his BEST Nolan strikes with his Non linear storytelling in his own style We will be blown with his sublime work This is definitely the sequel we deserved Christian Bale and Heath Ledger were phenomenal The Joker has made evil look so good This is the first film I know where the Joker who plays a negative role had such a positive impact on the film,Positive
Although an average film Batman Begins had a dark brooding quality and got off to an interesting start about the origins of the caped crusader before turning dreary Unfortunately this followup takes up right where the previous one left off  still dark but also dreary and even sillier The script is atrocious and the plot line involving TwoFace is unbelievably lame The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger He is simply fun to watch as the Joker All the other actors look bored a result of Nolans dull direction At a length of two and a half hours it seriously overstays its welcome Time to make Batman Ends,Positive

"Hands Down this is the greatest Superhero movie of all time Better than any marvel movie
The best Batman Best Joker Best Harvey DentTwo Face Heath Ledgers performance as the joker was just epic",Positive
"It is a movie where all the aspects of a movie are done upto perfection From the characters to the way the characters are developed through the storyline is out of the world
One of the best movies in the worldChristian Bales potrayal of Batman was amazingHe is the hero Gotham deserves
To conclude this movie itself is a Masterpiece",Positive
I have seen lots of movies where the storyline is so basic and straightforward that it is quite boring to watch but this film is has a more complex storyline and you will still understand it and enjoy it,Positive
Ive just been to see a preview screening of The Dark Knight Now Im no film reviewercriticwhatever but this film blew me away Blah blah blah on all the performances they were brilliant Heath Ledger is a truly psychotic Joker As one of his final performances he will be remembered as a villain who thrived on kaos and mayhem Maggie Gyllenhall Christain Bale Gary Oldman Michael Caine Morgan Freeman and Aaron Erkhart all gave such Oomph to their roles Technically the movie was fantastic With all the explosions you expect and the body count wasnt too high May be a little too much for children under  to grasp Go see it Go on Buy your tickets now,Positive
This movie has everything The cameras the sounds the really cool characters For me its one of few adventure movies worth watching more than once And of course Heath Ledger is as awesome as everyone says The characterization is so much deeper than the other films We get to see multidimensional people with purpose even if the purpose to to kill and maim We care about what happens for a change and we go along for the ride A small criticism is that it is awfully long and it takes so much time to resolve itself Also people do some pretty stupid things considering what a threat this guy is These are little things and without them we wouldnt have the huge finale,Positive
There is a pantheon of movies that define a generation Star Wars The Godfather Jaws and now The Dark Knight A cinematic masterpiece the films  and a half hours are both too short yet so immersing it seems like days Not one frame of wasted celluloid was included The cinematography was unbelievable with sweeping cityscapes and intense explosive action sequences The acting was also unbelievable Between Heath Ledgers tour de force which is definitely deserving of the Oscar buzz Aaron Eckharts tragic Harvey DentTwoFace Gary Oldmans ever brilliant presence as Lt James Gordan and Christian Bales intense and driven BatmanBruce Wayne everyone involved is absolutely stellar However what truly makes this film the cinematic event that it is is the story Truly epic in its scope but always aware that personal tragedy is what drives it This is a rare cinematic masterpiece in a time where summer movies have come to mean mindless fluff this transcends the typical superhero movie to achieve something truly spectacular Seeing this film was an experience that I will not soon forget and I truly hope others derive the same pleasure from seeing it that I did,Positive
seems like the comment on the front page was written by someone who must of been paid by the studio Jesus It wasnt that good dude Get a life or at least get out of Malaysia The movie was trying to be too many things It should of focused more on just being a action movie and not so much psychodrama Heath was brilliant but Nicholsons Batman was also great I couldnt see myself watching this again Once was enough And the Batmobile was down right bizarre It didnt look like something created by a rich man like Bruce Wayne I liked the performance of Eric Roberts as well as Heath Ledgers I believe the last batman was better as a followup on this day Aug th  I have watched the movie a few more times and YES it is a GREAT movie If grew on me and even after I met Gary Oldman at a highschool football game and commented on how well this movie plays on repeated viewings because the acting is so good he agreed Heath was brilliant and the movie does work on many levels I rescind my previous review,Positive
I know there were a lot of hype and excitement about this film but I think its the weakest in Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy Though it does have some strong movie elements such as good special effects high drama and a haunting music score this film is too dark even for Batman The plot drags action and violence are overkill and some of the cast performances were weakAs a fan of the comics I was hoping that this trilogy would follow the comic continuity more than the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher series But it wasnt meant to beWe have a story about Batman trying to rid the city of the remaining mobs but ended up facing a new villain the Joker Later on in the story crimefighting Harvey Dent flips a nerve and turn into TwoFace While pretty good acting Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker was too manic and sadistic I didnt care for the makeup and costume as well Aaron Eckharts performance of Harvey DentTwoFace drove me off the wall  bland as Harvey Dent and much too angry as TwoFace I know Director Nolan wanted to avoid camp at all cost after what weve went through with Schumachers films but the story is too serious and dark I would highly recommend Batman Begins or The Dark Knight Rises over this While also dark those two films had much better character development compelling plots and a better balance of humorGrade D,Positive
"Today was actually Batman dayliterally so they had this movie on TV
I saw it and liked it
The Dark Knight is well put together for any movie  Great acting from Bale and Ledger
Hans Zimmers soundtrack will keep you on your feet
As always  Nolans direction is as quirky as it getsThough I am not a fan I pretty much enjoyed it  I guess you will too if you are into superheroes",Positive
Greatest Super Hero movie of all time One of the Top crime dramas of all time Greatest Heath Ledger performance Heath WILL win the Oscar just like the Golden Globe Nolan has MADE BatmanIf you didnt get a chance to see this in Imax when it was out now is the time with the rereleaseThis movie is amazing in ImaxThe opening scene is entirely in Imax and any time you see a city shot as well Also the great chase scenes are done in the ImaxThis must be up there with most reviewed films of all time but Hey Its that goodSeriously if you havent seen this by now SHAME ON YOU,Positive
Dont let the title mislead you I am not going to bash the movie actually this movie is good only that the hype over the internetHeaths death and the Batman fansupport effected the movies overall rating too much I said this is a good movie But is it the best  Not even close In its own category it dominates most of the movies though probably as good as Ironman and better than the first movie Like most of the people I am satisfied with the film but there are a few criticisms that I can make about the fighting sequences jokers screen time and the process of the movie First I wonder why this film isnt called Joker Not only that Heath overshadows everyone with his performance he also has incredible screen time as well it is as if we are watching Joker as the main character everything revolves around him Maybe It was because there were too many characters in the movie with separate goals and purposes which also effected the process of the movie in my opinion The story sometimes advanced too slow and sometimes too fastbut too fast in general not allowing you to digest the theme fullyOne other thing is the fighting sequences the careography was not well made most of the time it was too blunt too dark and because of that hard to perceive Maybe it was the directors intention but it kinda disturbed me not being able to understand what was going onTo sum up it the movie was just like I expected but obviously below its hype with a few deficiencies a good movie in overall but definitely not a master piece,Positive
The opening sequence which most people have seen online due to the footage being shown on some trailer reels sets the stage for the entire film An eerie score brilliant directing and spot on acting There isnt too much that I feel comfortable saying about this film that hasnt already been said a thousand times and wouldnt give anything away I will tell you that The Joker is incredible The trailers thankfully dont really give away too much of Heath Ledgers incredible acting so I recommend seeing it for yourself A lot of people are complaining about the length of the film but the film covers a lot of ground and shortening it would be murder Go see this while you can its a classic and raises the bar for all super hero films,Positive
I have never been a big fan of Batman I went to see Batman Begins when it first came out and havent seen it a second timeI saw The Dark Knight and I thought it was a very good movie Because I dont know a lot about Batman a few points were a little hard to follow Overall though you wouldnt have to see the first movie in order to understand or really have seen the cartoons or read the comics eitherAs others have stated already Heath Ledgers performance was incredible Hes portrayal of The Joker was extremely creepy and psychotic adding humor to his morbidity The plot kept me guessing and wondering how it would endThis movie was very enjoyable and I will probably see it again,Positive
Bravo finally this truly was a quality film the acting directing and writing this film is like something youve never seen from a superhero  comic book adaptation filmsLet me start with the acting Heath ledger everything has already been said about this performance yet he still managed to surprise me what a performance hats off he really does get under your skin created togather with writers of course the perfect joker or at least the one i wanted to see dark psychotic and a maniac Aaron Arkhat or however you spell his name also gave a strong performance as Hearvy Dent and the other cast was pretty solidThe script is just great this is truly one of the best films if not the best that portrait the battle between good and evil between what right and wrong and about making the right choicesNow retrospectively i am really disappointed with the trailers for this movie they composed different sentences to give it a more intense feeling and gave a lot of the action in the movie sure they were great but also gives you high expectations for this movie and i hate coming to a movie with high expectations so a little let down in that aspect and yes  hours and a half did feel a bit longThat been said TDK is a fantastic movie sure it has some flaws but what movie doesnt its well written directed and acted action packed and even epic in a way only time will make itOverall this is a MUST SEE movie for anyone that has a little sympathy for movies,Positive
The sheer brilliance of this film cannot be described in words The Nolan brothers have delivered one of the most riveting and powerful scripts in recent times with lot of technical panache This is a film that never lets go of its momentum right from the beginning and holds your attention till the most morally complex climax in a summer movieDo not treat this film as a superhero or a vigilante story It has lot more going for it For instance one of the many Aces in the movie is the Joker  heath ledger He owns every scene that he is in and it was good to see the rest of cast let him grab the center stage whenever he is on screen The actor has set a tough benchmark with this role and he will be remembered for years to comeThe Dark Knight is as much a showcase of action set pieces as it is a classic story between good and evil and what happens when lines are crossed on both the sides to achieve their respective motivesBatman is a hero not because of the stunts that he performs or the fights he engages himself in but because the sacrifices he makes for the city he believes in This is beautifully depicted in this movie and we feel for him when the movie reaches its pinnacleThere are lots of positives one can see within this  hour plus epicIn simple words It is a  on  and must see,Positive
Now dont get me wrong I did like this movie but really Why does everyone think this is the most amazing superhero movie of all time the movie dragged on for far too long and really wasnt as entertaining as movies like SpiderMan  Iron Man or even the Tim Burton Batman films In my mind this movie doesnt hold a candle to those movies the general plot was boring and way too serious Bales acting was horrible He was much better in Batman Begins and there was way too much dialogue On the other hand Ledger was amazing as the Joker and the overall acting from the rest of the cast was good With the exception of Bale and Aaron Eckhart they were pretty bad in this one The action was great although at some points in the movie I felt like Ive seen it all before over all the movie was good and I wouldve even considered it a classic at one point but the overall hype of this movie seems to extinguish that notion from my mind as I said before its a good movie but not as amazing as people put it out to be,Positive
I personally feel that the Dark Knight is a overrated film It is not one of the top  or top  movies every madeIt is a good movie that I recommend seeing and it is by far the best super hero movie to be released But to call it one of the best and put it along side with movies such as Schindlers List and the Godfather is giving it to much praise I know I am going to get a huge negative response for this comment due to the fact that everyone loves this movie so much but I personally dont think it is a flawless movie like everyone makes it out to be It is good the acting is good the special effects are goodbut the hype for this movie didnt reach a crazy level till Heath Ledger passed then right before release everyone started throwing a fit over this movie Give it a watch and treat it as it deserves to be,Positive
The simpler it was the better it becameThe movie just showed me what I need to do in oder to become like him Thats how great the movie was A real detective story minus the characters cape and horns The movies complex plot was a product good understanding of a simple storyI like the way Bruce Wayne was portrayed a renewed man pretending to be a spoiled brat This is just a good way to hide his true identity by being what people expect him to be Like the Art of War when you are strong you pretend that you are weak A true player of the system so he can continue with his workThe Joker in this movie is just great evidence of great acting When you begin to see the character and not the actor you begin to understand that Heath did a great job on the Joker I remember the Joker not HeathThe movies theme and music became my lastsongsyndrome great score by Hans Zimmer The theme was really thought off and studied well understood the need of the storyAll I can say is this is what great movies are all about,Positive
To tell you the truth I was not a fan of Batman and I really dont like comics I saw The Dark Knight because my boyfriend wanted to see it And Im glad to tell all the world around me  The Dark Knight is super great and the unique one I think its not necessary to comment Heath Ledger and his role In my opinion the main character in this movie is not Batman but The Joker Ledger gave life to his crazy character As I have said at the beginning of my comment I was not the fan of Batmanbut sometimes must man change his opinion One special thank to Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard  The Batman soundtrack is phenomenal So go and watch it its a breathtaking,Positive
A good film but not the master piece every one is making it out to be One word Hype Two face is wasted and his existence is only known by Gordon and batman in the end so why bother using and wastinghis character was there any real point in Maggie Gylenhall The ferry bit went on far too long probably so they could give ledger more screen time The batbikepod thing looked really slow and spent most of its time spinning its wheels and looked like more of an excuse to release a cool toy tie in and i could go on but you probably all agree but are too blinded by hype and the fact that ledgers dead to see that this is a pretty average film Why was the scarecrow not arrested at the start of the film How come the clear reference at the end of batman begins regarding the jokers existence is completely forgotten about in the next movie I could go on but im sure youll all realise when the hypes died down In summery too long wasted characters a bit of mis casting and what the fk was with batmans ultra gruff voice i nearly choked on my popcorn first time i heard him Heath ledger is a sad loss however,Positive
The Dark Knight actually got lucky Movies over the last six years have been crap Scripts poorly written over budgeted for the visual effect  yet not transferring well to the big screen bad story ideas copy cats of other filmslack of creativity films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making Thats what weve had over the years Now comes Batman  Dark Knight Which is written well enough but whose aim isnt good story telling Its written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end Why another Batman Joker movie Its been done alreadyIt has a mindless assemblyline quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the   hours of this film The scenes are different only by location and a few faces Something bad happens the joker appears Batman appears Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears Over and over and over againThe other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark Like thats a good thing I dont get it Maybe because Ive had too many real life experiences that were truly dark Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining Besides movies over the last few years are all dark  even the lighthearted onesThis movie made me tired,Positive
Actually first of all I cant compare Batman Begins with the Dark Knight They have different plot Begins shows the introduction of Batman the origin of Batman The Dark Knight has a more darker plus interesting plot It is commendable Plus bigger action pieces the movie goes in deep with humans feelings It is quite good and I understand it receives a lot of positive reviews Christopher Nolan did a good job in everything in the movie making the story deep and dark but engrossingThe story The Joker is trying to destroy Gotham and wants to kill Batman at first With his trick plans nobody even Batman can find him or predict his next move Batman must stop the Joker from further destruction of Gotham From there humans emotions slowly rise There are some big action pieces plot that you want to know and electronic music I am somewhat disappointed with Twoface aka Harvey Dent considered the white knight I wished that Twoface will be given a bigger role Other from that it is hard to see any faults with the movie Acting is good Heath ledger makes a good jokerOverall It is good to watch this in cinema The runtime although long seems to pass quickly You wont be disappointed The first scene features bank robbing to hype the audience It not only shows you that it has the big action shows the bad and good of a human which is one of the thing in the movie,Positive
Saw it at a preview last night and thus did not have the benefit of reviews beforehand Although I let most of my kids watch Batman Begins I wont let anyone but the teenagers see this one I thought the movie was exceptional but the menace of The Joker is too intense for kids younger than that Im not suggesting theyll be scarred for life but dont let the action figures and kids meals fool you  this movie feels real and its one of the darkest Ive seen in a long time If youve read the Batman graphic novels of the modern era then you know what to expect but people unfamiliar with how low Batman can go may be in for a shock my wife was oneHeath Ledger for Best Actor,Positive
This movie is great but not one of the best ever its really overrated imoWith Ledgers Joker this wouldnt be as greatly reviewed as it is,Positive
Acting script music action and cinematography is all perfect This is the greatest movie since The Godfather,Positive
This movie was given way too much credit It was not as good as people said it was The only good thing about it was Heath Ledger This was the best performance of his tragically short life He was amazing as the Joker and extremely frightening The rest of the movie was a waste of my time though The other actors were sub par and the story was unoriginal That really annoyed me because of how people were RAVING about it This movie is not worth your time dont listen to the people saying Oh The Dark Knight is great its the best movie ever because that is not true I actually dont know if I was watching the same movie as those people as the movie I saw was total garbage almost but not quite saved by one absolutely stellar performance,Positive
When I walked out of the movie I was asked what I liked about it Everything I answered Everything was nearly perfect about this movie the action scenes were intense the plot was easy to follow to enjoy the movie but deep enough that it merits a small discussion with a group or multiple viewings and the acting my god the acting was incredible I found myself laughing out loud not because the movie was particularly funny but because Heath Ledger NAILED his performance in every sceneThe Jokers character nuances were hard to miss and easy to love After his first and second appearances in the movie I found myself just waiting for the next scene with The Joker Ive seen the movie twice now and cant wait to see it again just to see Ledgers actingIts not that the other characters didnt do their part because they did As always Christian Bale delivered a performance that is hard to rival Aaron Eckhart I feel has thrown himself into a realm where those who see this movie will be hardpressed to forget him Ive always liked Eckhart and now when I talk about him others will know who Im talking aboutThe only complaint I had is that the movie felt compact Yes it was long no it wasnt rushed I just felt like there was so much more story to be had Its like when youre reading a really good book and you see the number of pages narrowing and you just dont want it to endMy thanks and congratulations to everyone who made this movie TDK deserves its spot near the top of the greatest movies ever made,Positive
My wife and myself parents of three little kids rarely get to go to the cinema Two weeks ago during our holidays we got my parent to babysit the little monsters so that we can finally get out again Taking a peek into the papers actually real papers I had no internet access   revealed that The Dark Knight was the only watchable movie playing in the small nearby townSomewhat reluctantly we decided to give it a try What the hell we thought we are on holidays anyway why not check a kids movie sorry to all fans of previous Batman movies but thats just what I think of themBOY were we surprised After the movie it took us a few minutes before we both burst out this is one of the best movies I ever saw I wont go into any details for the multitude of excellent comments on this board already presents this movie as it is a MASTERPIECE Especially the performance of the late Heath Ledger Joker was unbelievable posthumous Oscar anyone I actually felt quite nervous and actually even a bit scared during some Joker scenes  something I didnt experience that often in a movie theater And yet we both felt that quite a few lines of his could have been from us Its a must please go watch it either in a real movie theater or in a DAMN good home theater While the special effects in this movie are just what they should be a mere vehicle to transport the message the atmosphere of the movie just wont come over if you watch it on a  monitor with your  headset on  Id gladly pay again to see it one more time,Positive
I thought I would be disappointed after all the hype that surrounded the movie but I was glad that I was wrong This movie rocks and by far the best movie in  And I thought that Batman Begins was difficult to top Heath Ledger gave the performance of his life You really have to give credit to the man he did came a long way from A Knights Tale and  Things His Joker was discomfiting psychotic and confirms my suspicions about clowns With his passing it up the spooky scale a few notches He held his own against the big wigs  well I think he even surpassed a few of them He has the best oneliners too His lines spoke of chaos death or the lack thereof Art imitating life or vice versa One wonders if he took his character a tad too farTo sum it all up The Dark Knight has twists at every turn exciting batmobile chases cool new gadgets and suit stellar performances tight plots and witty script This made for a very good summer movieGo watch it or youll be the last not to And parting in the Jokers now famous line  Why so serious,Positive
Admittedly everybody walks out of a cinema and the endorphins in your brain will be telling you That was the coolest flipping movie I ever sawThe Dark Knight is simply a masterpiece It builds itself up so many times only to turn around and take you in another direction Heath Ledgers much hyped performance lived up to all expectations being both chilling yet horrifyingly captivating Where I live in Australia was lucky enough to be one of the first showings in the world and I feel that many of the patrons in our cinema were there solely to see our lost son in his final performance and it is a great lasting memory for us to be left with The only minor qualm that I may have with this film is that the final cut is more about Heath Ledger than it is about the films star Christian Bale had noticeably less screen time than Ledger why this is I am not sure The performance of the cast is as you would expect from the stunning ensemble cast is remarkable Old hands Michael Caine Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman bring the prestige and grace to the screen while the new kids on the block Gyllenhaal Bale and the outstanding Aaron Eckhart truly knock it out of the parkIf you miss out on this film you truly are missing out it is a modern classic Believe the hype,Positive
This movie was very well done but does not compare with most of the movies in the top fifty Hype has built up this movie coupled with the overplayed fact that Heath Ledger overdosed on medication While Heath Ledger made the character interesting his acting does not compare with TRULY emotionally impacting roles Compare his acting with Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest While Heath Ledgers portrayal was effective the SCRIPT and the director made the movie truly effective Also this movie did not possess the intelligence of other Christopher Nolan movies In my opinion the best part of Christopher Nolans movies has always been his manipulation of time This is the first of his movies that did not make use of this Movies like Memento and the Prestige made use of time to create a sophisticated twists and turns These movies did not reach the rating given The Dark Knight due partly because their sophistication caused them to lose widespread popularity and also because they were not hyped as large summer blockbusters The widespread popularity of this movie as well as undeserved hype will eventually calm and this movie will be pushed out of the top fifty,Positive
I really wanted to see this in the theaterhowever I never did last summer Instead I waited till it came on cable and after watching it I really didnt miss anything by not going to the theater I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman but I dont think it was I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes I mean Batman on the chopper really wasnt that much action A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then thatAnd I really didnt think Heath Ledger was anything special in this His role was just a lot of hype Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the endI also have to comment on Christian Bales Batman voice What was he trying to do He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysemaFINAL VERDICT It was good just not as good as advertised I dont get why so many people thought it was the best comic book movie to be made,Positive
Sorry but this movie just doesnt do it For me the best Batman movie is in fact the first one with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson But thanks to Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine I stayed til the end of the movie The other actors including Bale were very below average I saw all superheroes movies but the worst one is this one At the top of my list is SpiderMan  it just got better and better since the first movie Batman does not deserve to beat all those records at the box office What a pity  Iron Man was good very good The Incredible HULK was OK but I prefer the first HULK with Bana I do not know but for me to be entertaining a movie needs to have a soul which is not the case for Tha Dark Knight Dsol its a bad movie That is all I have to say,Positive
I dont think I have ever seen a movie that has gotten as much hype as this one I dont think even the  Batman got as much publicity Too much prehype can really hurt a film I give Snakes On A Plane as an example I saw it today and wanted to set down my observations Yes it is a good film with a lot of action I grew up watching the Adam West Batman light hearted and campy The title of this movie is accurate they do make him as a dark night who has almost as much inner torments and demons as the villains he pursues He has just not let the darkness overwhelm him Like everyone else I was saddened by Heath Ledgers tragic death and I think that might be one of the reasons for the raves about his performance people see it with their hearts instead of their heads The truth of the matter is that yes he does give a good turn as the Joker He brought his considerable talent to the role and truly made it his own However he did not for one moment make me forget Jack Nicholson That was one part Jack was born to play and Ledger was real gutsy to even try but he didnt come close Ledger was good but there is only one Jack Nicholson and he is the best Sorry Heath have fun in Heaven though,Positive
Best comic movie and one of the best movies of all time,Positive
Many say The Dark Knight is the best superhero movie ever made I am not agree with that The Dark Knight is specially Movie with a super hero that have elements of neonoir heist movie gangster and crime drama Essential picture that made a revolution in some way in movie industry Everyone remember july  and that hype for TDK Before explosion of social networks internet was full of stories about this movie Everyone talk about it in gatherings In different vibe than first one this sequel deliver some dark story that dont want to be for Hollywood stories Simply story in old school way that not sell audience some characters and theri life in some comerical way that is buying audience for money This masterpiece simply got money for on classical way of storytelling Movie that is on the top for  years Movie that cinephiles and new generation talk about And never get boring Masterpiece in all way,Positive
Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham,Positive
usually I dont give a movie score of  so quickly after I see it But I wanna let you all know that if there was more than  in the votelike I would vote on thatLet me say first that THIS IS the movie of the year I know that everyone said its a great movie But I didnt know Id love this movie THAT muchThe Dark Knight ishonestlythe best movie I saw this year Of course I could feel that it was  hours and  minutesbut I didnt care After the  hours I wanted more And I got itThe movie was better than what I expected And I know that most of the people said that they felt like the movie focused more on the bad guys than Batman but I againdidnt feel that wayAnd how its possibly for me to end this summary without mention the GREAT JokerHeath Ledger Ive never seen him act so goodso convincing and Aaron Eckhart tooI saw here lately lots of comments that didnt love the movie WellI am so glad I didnt read them before I went to the theatreAll those comments would make me sceptical about itI can tell you to ignore those commentscause because of themyoull miss a wonderful movieI hope you all will get up from that chair youre sitting on right nowand just run to watch this movie When there is a work of art like this it deserves to be valued I dont really know if this movie deserves to be in  place on IMDb top  list but I dont think that any movie deserves that All movies are good in all kind of waysI hope that you all watch and ENJOY,Positive
This Batman installment isnt a bad one its just been completely overrated since the passing of Heath Ledger Secondly there was way too much material to be packed into the three hours alloted If anyone knows anything about the back story of Harvey DentTwo Face they are just left feeling empty and the character itself unjustified I understand Nolan was trying to do something different with the Joker but why disrespect Two Face Also there was really no BatmanBruce Wayne complex which I enjoy and feel is important to every Batman film Overall a good action film but will not be adding to my Batman movie collection Hopefully Nolan brings back Two Face in the next film and gives him a face,Positive
No words could give enough justice to this film It is truly a masterpieceMe and my friend decided to go to see this film in the cinema as we wanted to see Heath Ledger in this final film I am so glad I went to see this movie Ill admit that I wasnt sure whether to go and this film at first as Im not really a big fan of Batman and have never seen any of the other movies to do with BatmanI am glad I took the chance to go and see The Dark Knight because it was such a treatThe Joker was my favourite character and not because Heath Ledger portrayed him I found myself feeling sorry for the Joker and then not liking him and there has only been one other movie that has made me feel that way The GodfatherChristian Bale was great as Batman and in my opinion they could not have cast anyone better for the part Heath Ledger really did go out with a bang as he astounded me with his acting The Dark Knight was truly his best role that he has played well at least thats what I thinkMy list of favourite movies always changes but I know that this one will stay at the top for years to comeHope my review helped,Positive
wow i have just returned from a advanced screening of dark knightall i can say is wow the entire cast is incredible with a stand out by heath ledger the joker was the best character acting i have ever seen so scary so sad and darkly funny the action is outstanding the plot moves fast and there is never a dull moment simply put this movie is an instant classicChristian bale performance as batman is the best i have seen while he is in ledgers shadow this cant subtract from a truly dark batman characterAaron Eckharts version of two face is great a real change from the batman forever version again it keeps with the overall dark angry feel to this moviethe big question is heath ledger performance is it Oscar worthy i believe so i just hope his sad death doest subtract from this great movie,Positive
The Dark Knight is the peak of cinema and if you disagree this is at least the peak of cinema for DC Joker is absolutely iconic and has some good jokes but you cant help but feel that he is a true threat With the previous movie in the trilogy the villain had certain goals to cleanse society they werent completely immoral Heath Ledgers Joker stops at nothing His goal is to make chaos and as a great butler once said Some people just want to watch the world burn which is perfect description for this character testing to see how even merely mentions of his future actions can drive the world into a craze,Positive
The dark knight rises is a masterpiece Its a movie I can watch over and over It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time Heath ledgers role in this movie is excellent He played the joker perfectly The movie ends very well Its a lengthy movie but it doesnt seem very long because it keeps you interested I believe this movie should be ranked higher in the top  honestly At least number  This movie doesnt overload you on any one element Theres a perfect amount of action drama suspense and some comical aspects in there too Nolan did an excellent job on this movie and the whole trilogy actually This isnt one of those movies where you can predict the ending or how things will play out this is the joker The joker being in this one just throws you all over the place without making it confusing surprising would be a good word for it There is so many plot twists All in all Watch this movie if you havent already Its awesome,Positive
This movie is too long by about  minutes I was happy when the screen finally went dark A filmmaker should be able to get his point across in under  hours or before the collective audience ass starts hurtingIts a comic book and the effects and makeup are really great but still some of it is too inexplicable and so beyond the possible that it undermines the characters The Joker is deliciously strange and evil but if he can arrange those events that are so very complex he starts to look more like a circus ringleader whose dancing dogs and fireworks are the real charactersThe story was very hard for me to follow I dont appreciate having to try so hard to figure out what and why things happen in a movie I am still not sure why Mr Two Face went sour and frankly I didnt care that he didThere is a very heavy thematic effort here much of film is trying to clearly define good vs evil and the shifting ambiguity of that to end with Batman becoming rather dark and isolated I applaud this kind of effort in an action film but here the authors take just too long to get there I was itching to get out of my seat and had to force myself to sit through to the very end and thats not good for any movie,Positive
Back to the movie clearly the actors are first rate and the dialog is entertaining I particularly enjoy the incarnation of The Joker by Heath Ledger which may bring Heath a posthumous Oscar nod the writers give him some clever lines like the you complete me phrase in the above quote from Jerry MaGuire But you know what Im not buying Im not buying that this Batman flick because of its dark humor is better than other comicbookinspired movies aside from the rare Joker line nothing in this movie is humorous dark or otherwise In fact its uncommonly depressing I suppose Knight is similar to the later Spider Man films in which were to solemnly consider the deep emotional conflicts presented to a postpubescent boy who has been given superhuman powersMy friends these are movies and movie advocates that take themselves way too seriously For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews please visit my site TheCoffeeCoastercomBrian Wright Copyright ,Positive
First of all let me start by saying this film is in the elite list of best ever sequels Only a few sequels in film history have been better than the first this film is one of the best examples of that The first in the trilogy was a solid movie but what The Dark Knight did was take it to that next level it brought in some of the best characters in a genius way and elevated it to a modern classicA lot of this films success is down to the perfect casting Christian Bale reprising his role as Bruce Wayne  Batman Heath Ledger taking on the Joker in what can be described as one of the best on screen performances in history to Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman as James Gordon although the last  characters are supporting they truly do make the film and give you the heart of the movieWhat Christopher Nolan did when making this movie was redefine a genre every comic book movie since has tried to do what he did with this movie but just hasnt been able to capture the same spark There will always be Batman but I truly believe this will be the one everyone looks to for many years as the greatest of allThe Dark Knight truly is a cinematic masterpiece,Positive
I think this movie is everybodys favorite Batman movieNolan approached differently you know this is the super hero movie but it seems like real not fantasticActors and actress did great job so did Nolan of courseAnd and and of cource Hanz Zimmer he is one of the best modern composerI wrote actress and actors did great but i have to write exclusively about Heath Ledger What a wonderful actingAnyway this is the one of the best movies ever  ,Positive
Both the work of the image team and the actors brought this film to life giving a new definition to The Batman Cinematography holds up over time and most actions are believable and oncharacter,Positive
You can write a lot or you can write it briefly the best Batman movie ever Best director best actor in a leading role best actor in a supporting role best special effects,Positive
This movie gives you the true cinematic comic book experience that as a whole is a masterpiece no one will be able to be recreate The movie is brought to a whole by everything and everyone The work done on this movie whether big or small brought something very special Whether it was the authentic portrayals imperfect problems and hiccups the best superhero story ever seen yet or that it is one of the best acting performance ever seen in an action movie This is a forever classic,Positive
Great movie One of the best movies in the world is great,Positive
Maybe for me and I think most of true Batman fans at first glance this isnt comic book Batman that I was expecting Its marvelous how Nolan succeeded to present in one movie Batman that is so realistic and that we can connect to it and really be pulled into movie and that he preserves all craziness of Joker that is demanded from his character Batman movie can be done in various ways and one reason is because Batman and his greatest enemy have no superpowers and I see that as a good thing because then you have more space and need to present these characters not as someone who can really exist but as someone who put you more into movie and unreal world of comic book at the same time He put this two things together in something that almost everyone would watch and like but without losing true representation of Dark knight,Positive
Its one of the movies you should see before you die,Positive
Everything has been said about this movieI will just say Im still waiting for the MOVIE that can match this almost perfection in every aspect if you didnt watch this then you didnt watch a MOVIE yet,Positive
Ever since this movie came out Ive loved Batman Great story acting action and everything Love this movie more every time i watch it The music of course is amazing Hans Zimmer is the man Joker is still one of the best villains in cinematic history Im just writing this review so IMDb says ive written a review before So now Im just stalling to make this enough words Blah blah This movie is amazing but I already told you that Everyone has seen this movie and no one reads a reviews from a movie that came out in  If youre reading this youre a loser my grammar is so bad right now because Im writing so fast I just need  lines of text to finish my review,Positive
"Absolute banger and  halves
story is a dab
characters are a yeet
music is a u mom gay
overall is a watch now gai boi",Positive
Almost never does a sequel surpass the hugely successful prequel well not for Nolan the Dark Knight surpasses its predecessor in narrative intensity thanks to the majestic interpretation of the masked heros number one enemy Heath Ledger aka Joker Good versus evil moral personality versus personmade immorality both at the limit in pursuing their purpose so distant yet so close Pure action spectacle special effects narration practically a perfect film a milestone to be left for future memory No Batman will ever be the same again and no Batman will ever be like this Truly sublime,Positive
The best joker actor in the history of Batmans movies nobody came close to him,Positive
From where to start Maybe from my disappointment with IMDb and vote engine Or just leave that and straight go to the description of this movie  Bad directingup up up in tension and then totally down with low intelligent denouement Bad script too much talkingt non stop talking superheros and villains talking all the time everything must be explained Joker performance is nothing more than little above mediocre Im counting this in list because so much talking in public about awesome performance by ledgerwell maybe if you didnt watch any film with al pacinoif you just put attention to it you will see legder is trying the best to act like al pacino in talking scenes too much slow and heart breakingyeah lordoftherings scenes  film is next elections campaing nothing moreAnd film have few good things to be honest music is great pumping tension whole film  masks are very goodface mask is perfectShort this film in top ten alltime movies bah,Positive
The best superhero movie of them all Beats easily all of these new MCUmovies,Positive

Confidently directed dark brooding and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story The Dark Knight includes a careerdefining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances TDK remains not only the best Batman movie but comic book movie ever created,Positive
Christian Bale as Batman Heath Ledger as JokerNeed anything else to say,Positive
There seems to be a lot of hype about this film As I write its sitting at  with an average rating of  Honestly I dont think its that good Heath Ledger is fun as the psychopathic side of the joker but Im not sure hes any more enjoyable than Jack Nicholson  where for instance are the actual jokes Michael Caine just is NOT Alfred  butlers should speak much more correctly than that and the cockney boy just doesnt work for me Christian Bale doesnt seem solid enough as a Bruce Wayne Its a bit more jolly than the Tim Burton efforts  there is at least daylight this time  and the plot twists and effects are decent but I dont think theyre particularly groundbreaking All in all Id say its watchable but I dont expect it to hang around in the top  for too long,Positive
This is by far my favourite of the trilogy andor any other Heath Ledger is so dark in this as the joker such an underrated potrayal everyones so excited about the new joker but Im just here standing by this one all the timeAs for batman in this movie Phenomenal Such a great performance never been much of a DC fan when it comes to batman that changesDefinitely recommend,Positive
One of the best movies I have ever seen NO other Batman movie was this exciting for meMust watch for every batman fan even if you are not a batman fan this movie will make you one I guarantee it,Positive
This movie is just simply a masterpiece amazing directing by Christopher Nolan best performance ever by heath ledger once you see this movie you will love it,Positive
I really like this movie It was a lot better then what I thought it would be Heath Leger did an amazing job on this movie I did not expect much of the movie when i first saw it but this is really good Later I showed this movie to my mom and she hates super hero movies but she really like this one Or she just like Christian Bale Any way this is a movie really worth to check outIt has an amazing story line and the actors are just incredible It locks amazing to If i was to describe this movie whit one world it would be outstandingTo bad Heath Leger pass away He was south a god actor RIP Heath,Positive
"There isnt anything bad i can think about this film Brilliant  its a must see during the pandemic stay safe

Well made movie the best Batmam ever to be made and probably ever will be Nolan did an excellent theme to the dark knight one never seen before in any of the Batman franchises ever made heath ledgers acting was at its readjust when you thought he was at his best he goes a step further definitely worth being in the top  and so high number  on the list I would definitely recommend watching it even if you are not a Batman fan this will change your view on it finally this brings out a new side to the joker he has always been viewed as a funny character in cartoon but when you watch this your whole idea of him will change for good,Positive
this move is the most wonderful move I have ever seen I strongly advice the lovers of movies to watch it  its contain the action adventure  and mystery features  This move considered as the second film of the batman trilogy or the dark knight trilogy   i advice the people to watch all the film series   the events of the move are interesting  u cant feel of Boredom when u watching it  the actors and the actress of the dark knight film are so smart and talented  u will have the image this move is realistic and not just a move  Christian Bale  Heath Ledger  Morgan Freeman  Maggie Gyllenhaal Aaron Eckhart  all of them have the talents and strength to be engaged in this move  and Im the big fan of their movies and Their business films  the story of the film its about the evil is founded every where and the good will have the victory at last ,Positive
The Dark Knight directed by Christopher Nolan is a cinematic triumph that redefines the superhero genre Released in  it stands as one of the most iconic and influential superhero movies to date Heres a review of this remarkable filmChristopher Nolans direction is impeccable He crafts a dark and gritty atmosphere that befits Gothams grim world The films cinematography with its sweeping shots of the city captures the essence of a modern noir thriller The action sequences are intense and the practical effects add a visceral quality to the filmThe Dark Knight is not just a superhero movie its a deep exploration of complex themes It raises questions about morality the nature of evil and the sacrifices made for the greater good The film challenges viewers to ponder the fine line between hero and antihero,Positive

For many years I have wanted to see this movie I had heard various opinions praising the performances the scenery the soundtrack However I never got to see it until today And after seeing it I can affirm that it is a contender to be one of the best films in history There is no criticizable point Heath Ledgers performance is one of the best performances ever given on the big screen and even the secondary characters shine The city has a tone of horror suffering and fear just as someone would imagine Gotham and all this thanks to the excellent setting that this feature film presents both in terms of the scenery and the music composed by the famous Hans Zimmer Last but not least is the plot and I can firmly say that it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life I still cant assimilate how well the Jokers plans are made worthy of a crazy but charismatic and cunning villainIn conclusion ,Positive
I remember years ago my parents took me to the theaters We were going to see a movie called The Dark Knight and I remember not really caring for the sound of it Whats so special about a dark night Isnt night always dark And then the movie played and I was glued to it from beginning to end This movie is amazing to the music acting cinematography and the story Heath Ledger really brought his Agame for this movie and no matter how many times I see his performance I am always astounded by how amazing it is Thats not to say that nobody else did amazing as everyone as a whole really helped make this movie as great as it is but Ledger as the Joker just stands out as my favorite character in the movie Ive seen this movie countless times and Im no more sick of it as the first time I saw it,Positive
Its hard to believe that this film rates in the Top  of all IMDbrated movies Sure it deserves more than  stars on Heath Ledgers performance alone But lets face it This movie doesnt hold a candle to Nolans first Batman effortThere is very little plot There is a whole heckuva lot of brooding There is dark aplenty but to what purpose I got so tired of it I was ready to just have Heath get rid of Batman for once and allThe NolanChristian Bale combo is dynamite but this screenplay and plot is anything butStill there is Heath Ledger and he is really superb What a loss for us all And as always the movie LOOKS great filled with the typical Nolan touches Ive recovered and Im ready for a third NolanBale effort just with a bit more thought to story and at least some measure of action,Positive
It was a wonderful experience to watch Heath Ledgers Final performance on the big screen The film was fantastic along with the film techniques shown especially the interrogation scene The film itself is an is an extraordinary experience It will keep you glued to your seat as you take in what Nolan had to offer its audience All the actors especially Heath Ledger as the Joker are an unforgettable I am pretty sure the rest that going to view the film or have already seen it will agree Although not a masterpiece it belongs to be with the best films in history Id be shocked if Heath is not nominated for an Oscar or any other film related Oscars such as Sound or Cimenitography this film is a well notable film to be considered an Epic,Positive
Lets start with Batmans last line You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain This movie is surely the best of the year so far and deservedly soIll keep it shortall the characters and are given a worth time on screenalthough i still want more of heathpThe direction is superb as well is the acting by whole cast even the small characters of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are very well dealt with But the most important person who steals the show is one and truly MRHeath Ledger even Batman looks a bit frightened by himlook at the eyes of batman when he interacts with joker in cell This is easily the best batman movie and way better than Begins So ill just say watch it even if u are not familiar with batman franchise Watch it simply for the cynicism of heath ledger and ull know why is there an Oscar buzz Hats off to Nolan and RIP Heath Ledger well miss ya EASILY  AND HEATH ,Positive
In a short word  a masterpiece  awesome  mind blowing  must watch film ,Positive
"This movie is great
But its overrated
Its directed from one of the greats
Amazing script
Stunning score
And obviously an amazing cast
Aaron Eckhart is doing amazing
Michael Caine has great delivery
Gary Oldman is good
Maggie Gyllenhaal is a vital part of the movie
And obviously Heath Ledger is perfect
But Christian Bale is putting on the worst performance of his life every time he shows up as Batman in this movie I genuinely laugh because he sounds hilariously bad with a suit that looks terrible in good lighting or when hes not moving and the first scene of Batman talking to Commissioner Gordon is exactly that",Positive
Now the previous movie was great Batman Begins but this movie to me was even a step up from that the character were well written and i think did perfect justice to how they should actually be portrayed on screen,Positive
To start I would like to say that this movie is not even as good as Batman Begins Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors Batman is one of the best super heroes but that still does not mean this equates to The Shawshank Redemption or The GodfatherThis is a very good movie but it is not deserving of all of the hype surrounding it Health Ledgers death had more of an impact on this movies critical acclaim than anything in the actual movie The Joker is pretty cool because the screen writers made him cool not because Health Ledger delivered an Oscar worthy performance or any of that other BS People seem to forget that Liam Neeson played his character in Begins at least as well if not better than Heath Ledger played The Joker Also Christian Bale is predominately playing his snobby Bruce Wayne character in this film which is quite annoying After seeing the movie you might even realize that Christian Bales obscure placement throughout the film is a major flawThe Godfather is around  hours this is around  hours yet this movie feels much slower Rather than keeping a steady pace the movie seems to doze off for a while followed by huge explosions and overly drawn out  minute action sequences Its ridiculousThe best movie of  is In Bruges not TDK,Positive
It is a movie made by a passionate film maker whose passion could be sensed in every set pieces and story elements I happened to be very fortunate to get to watch it on its opening day  july And whatever ill assumption I made before entering the theater was completely vanished and i was speechless from its glittering imax footage action chase sequences to human emotions  everything is top notch I hardly believe ever there could be any film made with such perfection This is not an ordinary movie which is made from computer graphics footage but believe me the stunts are for real and performed under strict guidance and a lot of practice and a lot of hard work  Talking about the story  you could sense minute details of human emotions and it feels so refreshing that you would definitely be not forgetting at all It seems pretty rare for some blockbuster movie to offer that thing  on  from me worth more than  time watch,Positive
Quite obviously the best superhero movie ever made By a large margin as well Nothing before or since has even came close including the other two movies in this trilogy and probably never will Dark mature sophisticated exhilarating emotional and a true acting powerhouse Pure cinema,Positive
The GOAT of movies Must watch Before the age Not just a great superhero movie but also the best phycological thriller,Positive
Is The Dark Knight an exceptional Batman movie SureIs The Dark Knight the third greatest movie of all time as ranked by IMDbs top   as in better than Schindlers List better than Return of the King better than The Good The Bad and the Ugly better than The Matrix The Empire Strikes Back you know the actual masterpieces of cinema history Hahahahahaha Please Dont patronize meSorry not sorry I am not prepared like legions of others on the bandwagon to give a good but not great movie extra brownie points simply because a member of the supporting cast sadly passed away hyping the films notorietyThe Dark Knight is no better or worse a movie than its prequel or its sequel Overall its a solid and enjoyable trilogy but this movie is barely in the top  movies let alone top  of all time,Positive
This film was great its the best superhero films with its drama action and suspense The Joker was truly one of the best villains ever Heathe Ledger gives you chillsIts the film where clichs dont exist Nothing is repeated This film has great direction and not just bombs guns and explosion Many superhero films consist on action and stunts cheesy story and weak dialog However this film has a really edgy and a really well done story The special effects were just amazingA couple of scenery from the film I just didnt like didnt make me feel the darkness But that itActing was really good and not corny at all And for the writing is excellent,Positive
No words would do this movie justiceAnd I thought Batman Begins was great It wasdont get me wrongbut when this one came to life I think it put all other moviesincluding great Batman Beginsin its small pocketDefinitely the best movie of  so farno one knows what the future holds and definitely among the best movies of all timeActing was superbChristian Bale did an amazing job as the dark nightthe late Heath Ledger the Joker simply redefined the standards by which such roles would be judgedhis performance was impeccableIts among the very few movies that will make you root for the bad gay to a certain extent Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were excellent as usual in role and characterGary Oldman was great too as GordonSo was Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes respectivelyAs I said no words will do this movie justicegreat acting aside the plot was amazingly smart interesting thoughtprovoking and most definitely entertainingA MUST WATCH to allwill keep you in awe and amazement for the entire  hours and  minutesguaranteed And the one request you might have after those  hours  minutes is for the dude inside the booth to rewind the tape and play the movie again Watch ityou wont be disappointed had that been an option ,Positive
The Dark Knight is rightfully called that Its not a Batman movie either is it a Superhero movie Its a character film Honestly it should be called Harvey Dent as told by the Joker Its about three characters each dealing with heroism in their own way Its one of the most unpretentiously complex movies to be released in recent yearsThe incredible acting across the board stunned me Heath Ledger Gary Oldman Maggie Gyllanaal Michael Caine and Aaron Eckhart all give the performances of their livesThis is an amazing film and will stand the test of time as one of the greats Nolan is to be commended for his incredible vision,Positive
So Im starting to come around on The Dark Knight I now think its pretty good When I first watched it I didnt like it at all Then I watched it again and liked it a bit better Now I think its good or could even be very goodIm finally starting to understand Heath Ledgers Joker performance I now think its great I think the point is that it is such a facade it leaves you wondering what is behind that facade and then you realise theres nothing there That is what makes the performance so terrifying The Joker IS the mask Who is wearing itA criticism I have now heard from a few people about this movie  a movie nobody dared to criticise for years  is that there should have been only one villain Joker was enough I now feel inclined to agree Harvey Dent is a great character but TwoFace feels unnecessary His descent into bad guy mode after being a true hero also feels unwarranted Such a massive turnaround probably needed a whole movie to explain Instead TwoFace gets Jokers leftoversI also feel the movie was too long I often lost interest toward the end,Positive
Few films leave you genuinely questioning whether you truly understood them quite like Inception does The cast is outstanding the story itself feels like a puzzle you cant stop trying to solve and the music subtly pulls you deeper without overpowering the experience All of this has drawn me back to watch the movie at least five times over the years  and I know Im not done yetIve always admired Leonardo DiCaprio and in this film it feels like he poured everything he had into the role All thats left for me now is to keep hoping that someday well get a second partSo keep dreaming,Positive
"You only get to watch this for the first time once so choose your state of mind carefully
It is a film about movies and dreams and reality and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter
It is spectacular and brutal and enigmatic and disturbing
It is beautiful and absorbing
It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen
I dont see it often in case its not as good as I like to remember it
That is my secret that I lock away in my safe in the basement
That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all
For some perhaps it is in the cinema watching this",Positive
When you wake up from a good dream you feel the reality is harsh When you wake up after a bad dream you will be sentimentally attached to the beauty of reality But as long as life is good reality and dreams dont matter,Positive
The th Century had Casablanca Star Wars the Godfather Blade Runner and others  this is the first of the st Century masterpieces Truly in awe at how amazing this movie is an astounding show of all aspects of films Amazing story and cinematography accompanied with actors worthy of telling the tale Remarkable and breathtaking,Positive
When I first watch this movie I was just shocked with its twist Im not gonna mention details because cant share any spoilersSimply this movie makes a complex story that makes you question so many things Why he is keeping her in his dreams or whatever your question is answering with some well written line That scene is the key to the whole movie That line between Cobb and Mal answers all your questions at onceThats why I like this movie so much Some movies has that potential Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence Youre waiting for that line for whole content But most of the contents I mean movie or TV Series are not managing that wellBesides the greatness of the storyline this movie has a really great cast So Acting Performances are also great Award Winning Cinematography by Wally Pfister was too great Original Scores by Hans Zimmer was brilliant Visual Effects are unique So not only the Screenplay but nearly all the technical details are great,Positive
Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth Its absolutely impossible to explain the incredible that Inception has Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting edge of seat mind blower and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there Congratulations to the well deserved best director writer and producer of films in my opinion Also the acting is fabulous everyone did an amazing job and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept Also the CGI and effects are amazing Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie,Positive
Inception is a beautiful piece of film that has impacted a large part of the film industry With everything from the actors to the cinematography to the music this movie without any elaboration perfected almost everything there isInceptions slow start is the only weak point of this movie It begins intensely to then slows down for the next    minutes While then finishing off as an impeccable film Nevertheless this is what brings the film down for meThe director Christopher Nolan managed to create a masterpiece with little to no mistakes At no point during this intensely long movie did I feel bored Instead I was always excited and on my toes intriguedThe acting in this movie was phenomenal A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didnt win an Oscar for his performanceMeanwhile also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer the music adds significantly The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested Few composers can make you notice the music but Zimmer succeeds per usualTo finish of the film was astonishingly shot With beautiful eyecatching scenes While also containing some incredible action scenes that might be some of the best action Ive seen With a thoughtprovoking storyline that finishes of with an unbelievable endingI highly recommend Inception to everyone and I promise you wont be disappointed,Positive
This is not a bad film per se had it been about  minutes shorter I would not have been too offended But I am genuinely perplexed as to how people can rave over it   on all time list at time of writing There is virtually no character development the plot is overly complicated and riddled with holes and contradictions Frankly you dont need to suspend disbelief so much has have it surgically removed and flushed down the toilet By the end I was wishing I was in a dream within a dream policed by a completely arbitrary set of nonsense rules  anything to get me out of that chairIs this really the same man who gave us Memento,Positive
There are those who seek to dive into your mind take your secrets and whatever else they find espionage conspiracy infiltration skulduggery through worlds that are all conjured well designed Theyve been asked to plant a seed start an idea change the course of an industrialists career but it needs dreams within deep dreams an architect to build the schemes and the consequences could be quite severeImaginative beyond words elegantly crafted and constructed presented and performed by legends of the screen with a great storyline that keeps the viewer constantly engaged and on the edge of their seat  what more do you want out of movies,Positive
I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out and like most of DiCaprios films it blew me awayInception is a wellmade movie filmed in about  locations all over the world The directing was outstanding there were only about two moments maybe three seconds in total where i noticed that visual effects were being used of course defying gravity is pretty difficult The plot was very pleasingly intricate with a twistandturn keepyouontheedgeofyourseat type feel I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island which i also enjoyed very muchseeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not Its great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenadethrowing action heroes who achieve greatness in the endInception also has a very wellcomposed score which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie If youre thinking about seeing Inception definitely go Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show it is worth every penny you pay Truly unique like nothing ive ever seen before Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasnt afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending,Positive
If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece one sees something new each time Thats what true art is Thats why a black light Elvis is not art This film is certainly a tour de force It requires engagement at every step LIke most works of art it doesnt give it all away I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time First of all the premise is wonderfully engaging Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened only to find themselves in another nightmarethen they awaken again We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control There you have a wonderful premise Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends While confusing its exciting The amazing thing is that the directorwriter pulls it off Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed We care about the matrix of the dream levels Great movie,Positive
This is an excellent film The CGI is great The characters are great But I have one problem which is the character development It didnt have much of it but that is the only problem The movie did start of really confusing but in the  minute part I got used to the story In conclusion this is a great film and I would highly recommend it,Positive
"The pieces of the movie are amazing
 Hans Zimmers music is hauntingly beautiful probably my favorite movie score ever The premise is unique and fascinating
 The special effects are amazing and dont distract unlike some Pierce Brosnan Bond movies They fit into the plot perfectly The acting is very goodBut the assemled pieces make the whole only very good not amazing The movie is just too big and they had to edit it to cut it down to essential info and scenes resulting in a slightly unnatural flow that feels like trying to drink from a fire hose shoved in your mouth A mild subtle infodump feeling arises at times There are no natural lulls or pauses to digest info The first time watching you will feel absolutely lost for the first  minutes or so unless you read spoilers first due to a combination of that flow and some out of sequence story telling The nd time watching will be much more enjoyable than the first it is that lesser enjoyment the first time through that keeps it from being amazing knocking it down to just very good There are two main storylines one mostly in the present the other about the main characters pastfound myself wondering if the latter could have been less prominent or even cut to focus more on the former",Positive
Though this was a very good on your toes dont blink kind of movie In the end I had to ask myself Was it all a dream Acting superb and directing on point Very good movie,Positive
An amazing science fiction movie Christopher Nolans another masterpiece Need a sharp mind to understand the story  enjoy this movie,Positive
Boring of me to say but this is one of my favourite movies of all time Stellar performances great plot and an ending that keeps you guessing The CGI is exceptional and I think its arguably one of Nolans best films,Positive
When we talk about Christopher Nolan we are talking about one of the greatest directors humanity has ever produced I honestly cant describe my feelings after watching this masterpiece It delivered some of the most goosebumpsinducing moments in the history of cinema A truly unforgettable experience,Positive
When i see any upcoming NOLAN films i cannot hold my nerves togetherStarting from the sheer brilliance of MEMENTOTHE PRESTIGETHE DARK KNIGHT n all perhaps he is the most talented and thought innovative director in HollywoodIn other words unless u see a NOLAN film till the climax  u cantt predict its ending n thats what i like about himHe simply keeps puzzling the past and the present in perhaps the most thoughtful way Coming  the film its another gem of a work by Di Caprio after SHUTTER ISLANDN wen u have casting like MICHAEL CAINEELLEN PAGEJoseph GORDON LEVITT etc its surely a must watchI can assure u that u cantt even leave a single second while watching the filmIts a scifithriller directed by NOLANThat says it all Afterall YOUR MIND IS THE SCENE OF THE CRIME Frankly speaking a must watch movie without any doubt,Positive
I had the honor of seeing a prescreening of this film tonight in Dallas Now I have seen lots of movies in my time but this movie is by farexcellent I am simply amazed at Christopher Nolan for blessing us with this filmi truly amThe trailers can only give you so much and Im so glad they dont go too much in depth with the plot You are literally drawn into the movieActing Cinematography StoryPlot Mind Stimulation I cannot wait to read more reviews on this film It was well worth  hours and I am positive that I will be seeing it AGAIN later this week when it opens in theatersGO SEE IT,Positive
Inception is the Smartest film of the YearINCEPTION PG Directed by Christopher Nolan Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Inception is the smartest film you will see all year It never plays down to the audience in fact it assumes the audience is intelligent Inception tells the story of Dom Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio as a thief with the rare ability to enter peoples dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost him everything he loves Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task Plant an idea in someones mind If he succeeds it will be the perfect crime but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobbs every moveThis movie is challenging but always in a fun and inventive way that keeps you captivated It is an updated s crime drama with a technological twist that just works After the fight scene in the hallway you will agree with me that Christopher Nolan will no doubt take home a few Oscars this year Sound Design Cinematography best Original Screenplay Director and Film unless something monumental is released between now and then One scene alone should get Nolan the Oscar and that being the city folding back on itself Most films this year are like sitting down to a bowl of potato chips Inception is like sitting down to the juiciest thickest most filling steak dinner youve had in years Inception opens Friday July   out of  Stars Jay Fox,Positive
I got an invite to a free prescreening of this movie I had been seeing some previews of the movie but I hadnt really listened to what the previews were saying at all I hadnt read anything about what the movie was about So I went into it without any kind of expectations what so everI love Science Fiction and this one did not disappoint I thought it was a great movie If you have a chance to see it on some kind of digital projection or IMAX do it An old film reel theater just wouldnt do it justiceIt is pretty action packed lots of twists and turns gets a little deep and leaves you thinking with a little bit of a hanger at the end Phenomenal cast I would pay money to see it again and recommend everyone to go see it when it opens Friday Two Thumbs up StEpHeN,Positive
An incredibly unique film which deserves its plaudits purely for the intelligent world created Whilst extremely complex the science allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene It keeps you engaged throughout and I think  youre routing for the right people although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak possibly skimmed over and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreamsVisually it cannot be faulted and the pairing with the music works excellently as well Youre constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing more interesting than compelling Having said that it is really one of a kind at least at this level and so everyone should see Inception if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into,Positive
There is no way Inception will be a bad movie because it was directed by Christopher Nolan There are many words to describe this movie and those are mindbending imaginative exciting overwhelming entertaining and awesome Inception might be the only movie this summer that has an original conceptInception is very unique and it is fresh to everybody The visuals were overwhelming The action scenes are awesome The CGI effects were realistic and eye candy The story is interesting and mindbendingThe performances were great Leonardo DiCaprio is still a great actor Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe are one of the best parts of the movie Cillian Murphy is disappointing though Joseph GordonLevitts performance is flawlessInception is mindbending and nonstop entertaining Once again Christopher Nolan made another successful blockbuster Inception might be the best movie of the year,Positive
Inception is a first class mind blowing complex action thriller it boats outstanding special effects an A list cast and some insanely clever conceptsIt was love at first sight I adored this film when I first saw it and over a decade on its still as good For me its up there with The Matrix it truly is that goodIts one of those films that improves with subsequent viewings as there is always something new to pick up some detail that you may have missed the previous timeThis film packs some big punches it dazzles in every avenue one of the biggest features the visuals those special effects look remarkable still The scenes of the streets folding over just an incredible moment surrealAnother incredible feature the acting Cain Cotillard Murphy Hardy all fantastic as for Leonardo DiCaprio I still regard it as one of his best ever performances hes phenomenal he commands your attentionHave you ever dreamed youre dreaming What a thing to contemplatePersonally this film is in my top ,Positive
I got the opportunity to see this movie a week in advance  Let me just say it is no disappointment in every witch way As most of Leonardos movies are good this one is even better it will blow your mind so yes i recommend everyone should see it even if you like Leos work you will still enjoy this movie Moments in the film keep you at the edge of your seat waiting to find out what happens next I fell in love with this movie because of its originality and the imagination that took in to realizing this movie Christopher Nolan has yet again made another great movie All the cast members did an amazing job with Inception Thank you for making this movie Im sure i will see it plenty more times,Positive
Inception is the first movie nominated for Best Picture that I hated on Its not all thatMy biggest problem was that they couldnt get me to care about the relationship between Leonardo DiCaprio his wife and his child which was suppose to be Dom CobbDiCaprio character biggest motivation I could care less for any of the characters I wasnt emotionally invested at allThis isnt the first time Christopher Nolan tried to take Film Art concepts and commercialize it This is an attempt at making a surrealism commercial The problem with trying to make a surreal movie for the general public is that you have to make it understandable to the masses The dreams in the movie was too orderly Surrealist films like Un Chien Andalou are chaotic like dreamsBig visuals and action sequences arent enough anymore if you cant get me care about what drives the story youre going to lose me,Positive
Good news is I got to see it for free on an HBO free weekend and did not have to pay to see itBad news I got to see the movieI was really looking forward to this movie The trailers were great and the concept was intriguing The problem was the execution Once again chase scenes fights explosions special effects etc took the place of good writing What could have been a cerebral movie just turned out to be another action movie I do not want to take anything away from the special effects they were very good and some were outstanding My problem was that maybe there was only  minutes of actual plot and dialog in the entire movie After a while you quit wondering if it is real or a dream and just start dreaming that the movie will end soon There are really no good twists and turns in the movie and little that is so thought provoking that you want to talk about the movie afterwordsMy advice would be to take the special effects budget and spend it on some great writersAs the old commercial asked Is it real or is it Memorex Who cares,Positive
Nolan is careful never to let the scope of the film overwhelm the human element and this is a key reason Inception works as well as it does The acting from a great ensemble led by DiCaprio is as good as it gets In terms of sheer originality ambition and achievement Inception is the movie of the summer the movie of the year and the movie of our dreams world need directors like NolanSpielbergCameron As with his previous movies Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors who can best embody the characters in his films While DiCaprios role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island theres no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly Joseph GordonLevitt radiates confidence and suavity Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performanceBut Inception is Nolans vision through and through and in fact a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes Inception both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment just take the names of the various characters each of which have a special significance With Inception Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities possibilities of alternate realities of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly of the power of imagination It is that rare gem of a film that is so multilayered so profound and so fascinating that youll want to experience it again immediately after youve seen it just so you can fully appreciate its genius,Positive
Dom Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio is a skilled thief the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable Cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever lovedNow Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossibleinception Instead of the perfect heist Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one If they succeed it could be the perfect crime But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming Inception ,Positive
Do not let anyone tell you anything about this movie before you go see it It is best experienced with thrilled expectations  and you will not be disappointed The acting by all cast members is terrific the story line is amazing and the special effects are breathtaking I am so honored to have attended a sneak preview of this movie The theater was packed without one empty seat and the crowd was so into the movie it was silent until the end Their reaction at the end was loud and vocal I will admit that I got a terrible tension headache from the intensity of being a part of this experience But I will never ever forget the movie I also must admit there were several times while watching the movie that I wanted someone to explain things to me I commented to my husband  WTF but rode it out thinking comprehending and understanding I do think that younger people will get the story better than older people since they play multitiered level games so the concept wont be so difficult to wrap their brains around it Outside the theater afterward no one would leave  they just stood around talking about it reliving scenes ideas and concepts This is THE movie to see,Positive
The only way to describe this movie in one paragraph is it was like the first time a person has sex its hyped for about  or three years of your life till finally its prom and you got the parents station wagon and you got a hotel in the country all set up for your first big night of love Then you go to pick your date up and shes gotten braces over the weekend OK not the worst thing in the world Then you slip and fall while shaking the dads hand and karate chop his balls and grab her mothers blouse and rip it off on the way down Then on the way to the prom you get a flat and you go and change it and you get oil all over your tux Then you go to the prom and you think itll be so cool now that more people are being added to the mix But its not and it sucks because theres now so much sexual tension built at this time the dudes dont wanna dance for fear of boners and the girls dont want to for the same reason Then you finally leave and get out to the hotel and you think ah well this whole night was crap but this will redeem it This will make it all better Then you realize shes got braces And her hymens still intact And what ensues is  minutes of nothing but blood pain and screams of agony coming from both parties till eventually you cant even look at her anymore and you wont be able to jerk it for a month now because your scabbed penis needs time to heal Yeah thats what inception was like to meStick with Momentoesk stuff dude,Positive
This movies is a masterpiece by one of he greatest directors Christopher Nolan And he made it in some way that the twists and turns are the best of the best of the best I also appreciate the actors in this movie I especially liked DiCaprio Tom Hardy  Gordon Levitt,Positive
Ive never done a review before so be gentle but having attended the Irish premiere of Inception last night I felt compelled to write and tell people to go and see this movie If you only see one picture all year make sure this is itAs people have stated dream movies have been done before however not with this style and complicated simplicity youll understand what I mean when you see itThe acting by everyone is first rate if the emotional story of Cobb and Mal wasnt believable then the film would fall asunder however Di CaprioCoitillard carry it off to perfection Everyone else in the ensemble cast is terrific with particular mention to Tom Hardy get this guy more workUnlike many reviewers I didnt find the story difficult to follow although rapt attention is essential and Nolan has delivered a story which doesnt attempt to talk down to you as I felt with the Matrix instead it draws you in and delivers in the last hour probably the finest piece of film making Ive ever seenThe end of the movie was met with rapturous applause and I realized my hands were shaking I had tears running down my face and sweat running down my back Truly outstanding stuff Christopher Nolan youre a genius,Positive
I vaguely remember the time i watched this movie which was a long long time ago but i definitely remember being blown away by this masterpiece I would love to experience something similar again,Positive
One of the best movies out there I highly recommend it,Positive
Like all Nolans films its mindbending and original and incredibly entertaining But sorry theyre not as brilliant as people think Theres always so many holes in the writing as mentioned by others like how Matthew McConaughey went inside a black hole to communicate with his daughter on Earth in Interstellar Is it creative Sure But for those of us who like our writing to be tidy its more than a little annoying Furthermore it has no real twists or intrigueFor a person who is deeply interested and well read in psychology I enjoyed the journey into the psyche through dreams Its accurate in many ways that a dreamer does not control their subconscious and theoretically one could hijack it In fact people do this all the time but one does not need to be asleep and dreaming Its called brainwashing No dream within dreams within dreams necessaryI liked the levels of action  it is a fun watch And all the actors are adept in their roles I really dont even mind when writing is not based in reality as long as people realize that its not Theres really nothing particularly bad about Inception  it just doesnt live up to the hype,Positive
Genius from start to finish Unbelievable Ive been a fan of Christopher Nolan since Memento but this takes his immense talents to the next level I wouldnt trust this film in the hands of any other filmmaker Truly,Positive
Inception is not just a movieits an experience that reshapes the way you think feel and perceive reality Rating it a perfect  feels almost inadequate because what the film creates for itself goes far beyond conventional cinema Its thrilling intellectual emotional and endlessly immersiveThe feeling of Inception is unmatched From the first moment youre pulled into a world where time bends reality fractures and the mind becomes both the battlefield and the prize The pace is razorsharpnever rushed never slowperfectly balancing exposition with adrenaline Every layer of the dream adds tension and every ticking second feels heavier as the story unfolds You dont just watch the film you actively participate in itWhat truly elevates the film is the sheer brilliance of its performances Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a deeply layered performance as Cobb carrying guilt grief love and obsession with remarkable intensity His emotional weight grounds the films highconcept narrative in something painfully humanCillian Murphy brings quiet vulnerability and depth making his emotional arc one of the films most powerful elementsJoseph GordonLevitt is effortlessly sharp and controlled especially in scenes that have since become iconic while Tom Hardy injects charisma wit and style perfectly balancing intensity with charmThe story itself is Oscarworthy in every sensebold original and intellectually fearless It introduces new ways of understanding time memory guilt and reality leaving the audience questioning long after the credits roll Few films dare to trust the intelligence of their viewers the way Inception doesand even fewer succeed so completelyA cinematic landmark defined by ambition precision and emotional depth Inception  earns its  for being thrilling yet thoughtful complex yet accessiblea film that doesnt just exist in your mind but stays there spinning endlessly,Positive
If at all there is even a single person that hasnt watched this classically good movie then they missed out It is mainstream but that doesnt change the fact that it is objectively a good movie that is if you are ready for intellectually stimulating movies This one is just that and the ending is famously known to be hard to decode But I say rather than trying to find answers let ambiguity be ambiguity There is a beauty in the incompleteness of this art Just like Requiem by Mozart it is perfect just the way it was made,Positive
Brilliant technical wizardry Heady at least apparently so A ride more than a movie but a movie none the less Chris Nolan is rapidly becoming the director of his generation and i m longing to find out what is he trying to say He has established his technical power again and again but if I think of Memento for instance I remember the gimmick but not what the story was really about I suspect the same will be said of Inception I m not putting down I m just wondering I left the theater full of questions and nobody could actually give me any answers I m not talking about the plot but at the way Christopher Nolan chose to tell the story Leonardo Di Caprio is acquiring some extra gravitas as an adult presence on the screen Loved Cillian Murphy I always do Riveted by Tom Hardy Enchanted by Marion Cotillard,Positive
It was One of the best movies Ive ever seen  This is a unique movie,Positive
Repeated views to understand a movie That is what I call a MOVIE and this one of those If you can just watch in theatersDream in a dream in a dream in a dream Amazing concept and how they executed also marvelousMust watch ,Positive
Inception in no matter how many rewatches I attempt never fails to blow my entire mind By now i of course know the story and twists pretty well but I LOVE how much is still left up for interpretation and can have you view the entire film differently from all the previous watches Nothing short of astonishing and incredible visuals that create some awesome dreams after watching if you dont get spooked easy,Positive
Ive watched this movie because it has a great rating and because I love Christopher Nolan and in my opinion it totally deserves this great ratingit could maybe even be a little bit betterThere are tones of great stuff in this movie like the concept of dreaming which the whole movie is about and this is one of the greatest concepts Ive ever witnessed It just makes soo much fun watching these Characters do their thingOn top of that the movie has such a great soundtrack Hans Zimmer has once again topped himself The actors also do their best to make the emotional scenes hit hard and theyve done their Job really really wellThis movie is one of the greatest of all time in my opinion and you should probably watch it if havent already,Positive
I can describe this masterpiece from Christoper nolan movie this is incredible movie ive ever watch Great pacing great idea graat plot great casts Wonderful concept and cinematography from imax which is perfectly match and i respect to the all the crew members of this part of film Have a good day,Positive
I was keen to see this film given the high IMDb rating as I agree with nearly all ratings Ive seen on the site but I appear to be one of the minority who think it is overrated I couldnt emotionally engage with the characters for some reason and so was not too concerned on the outcome for themWhilst there were some complexities to the plot it is reasonably easy to understand I agree with some other comments Ive seen that many characters accepted the quite fantastical premise very readily and were prepared to place themselves at considerable risk for no real reason So some reactions were not what you would expect for the situationHaving had time to reflect I would watch the film again but do not think I will keep coming back to this unlike the Matrix which has a similar feel but is a much better film,Positive
"It has taken me  years to get round to watching this and during that time I looked forward more and more to seeing it
Was it worth the waitNOI find it difficult to find anything positive to say but the premise and idea of the film is interesting
That sadly is all its an overblown mess of a movie with no place for a connection to the films characters
A collection of choreographed fight scenes connected by dream science mumbo jumbo and accompanied by a bombastic score does not make an interesting movie
Mr Nolan should have spent his time focusing on a coherent story and some character development less time on trying to shoehorn in pointless actionA bitter dissapointment of a movie",Positive
I watched the first day first show of the movie it was amazing First of all the story was brilliant and unique It is actually very difficult to implement such complex story because there are so many characters and so many explanations of how things are going on and so many levels in the movieThe concept of dreams and dreams inside dreams was unique All the action sequences were very well doneI think such complex stories only great directors can tell because there were so many small pieces in the movie which needed to be connectedI expect this film to be nominated for Oscars because of being unique and very well made movieOnly the directors like Christopher Nolan would dare to implement such unique concepts VERY GOOD I would give this movie Rating    and it is a MUST SEE   Please watch it in theaters ,Positive
Well to speak Christopher Nolans movie memento i saw some what quiet a long time ago i just came into the genre of unfolding events but it was an exceptional movie to watch and i said man i have to check out who is the maker of this film i was hoping for some biggie should be behind its making and then i came to know Christopher Nolan and for years he has done very less films and delivered us all his potential great movies to entertain the audienceAnd Now He Has done it again with another great movie inception such a remarkable movie you just get to know we have seen movies like the matrix and the talk about mind games movies but it is different from all others because Christopher Nolan has a different mind perception of all others who have tried a different acting is great and how the characters take you into it all you got to do is sit back keep your eyes and ears open and the rest will follow with you,Positive
All I could manage to say as I left the theater was That was awesome This is one of the best movies I have ever seen From the story to the acting to the action there wasnt anything lacking from this film There are so many layers not only in the plot but in the depth of story telling that go on in this film I dont know how he fit so much story into a couple of hours and still it can make perfect sense This is a movie you can watch  times and I probably will and still catch something you didnt see before It was so easy to get caught up and forget you were in a theater and not actually in the room with the characters I cant remember the last time I was so immersed in a film I actually had to remind myself occasionally that it was only a movie I loved everything about this The action sequences were just amazing I dont think these things have ever been done in film before It was like watching a perfectly done live action video game The mind twisting story keeps you guessing till the end and even after There was even a tragic but heart warming love story in the middle To fit all of this into a film is just incredible My advice to anyone is to find the biggest screen in a theater you can and go see this movie I dont even think an IMax screen is big enough for this gnarly piece of cinema,Positive
Super blown away by Inception I cant get over how Christopher Nolan can keep topping himself with each flick At first I was so scared to see this fail because of the curse of the stellar cast but i should have had faith in Nolan all along This is just unbelievably good He takes his time telling such a complicated story without dumbing it down or complicating it too much All the actors play their parts well that even Leo DiCaprio in a rare way fades into the character and you forget his celebrity Everyone and everything is just amazing from the ominous soundtrack to the sets to the acting and cinematographyall I could say at the end of the flick was WOW,Positive
The reason I named this review the way I did is because Ive fallen asleep watching this turd of a film so many times that I dont dare to count anymore my brother unfortunately loves it so Im forced to watch it They shoulda paid me to come see this crap because I want my money back For startersa dream in a dream in a dreamyou couldnt think of a better way to say that It makes the complexity of an already complex movie even more so by adding demensions that I just do not give a flying crap about When I go to see a movie I dont like having to work to understand it I didnt leave WORK early to come home get dressed and take my girl out to WORK we came to see a movie This movie will mind rape you and in the end the entire theater myself included walking out afterwards scratching our heads and saying what the eff just happened This movie did teach me something thoughit taught me how to not get laid She hated it I hated it no poon for meSo do yourselves a favor dont listen to the idiot critics on this site bc their too busy shooting up some black tar heroin to know what they are talking aboutbecause this movie is absolute trash  stars was being nice,Positive
As a long time lurker on IMDb Ive slowly been working my way through the top  I can honestly say that this film has surpassed anything I have ever seen before despite the hypeI was gripped from start to finish An amazing concept backed up with emotion and even some groundbreaking action scenes I spent the entirety of last night trying to get my head around what could have actually happened such is the depth of the story Never before has a film had such an impact on me  I woke this morning to the realisation that I had several dreams last night which were very uneasy for the first time in yearsThis film is the reason Ive finally signed up to this website Im a massive fan of films such as The Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather but in my opinion this raises the bar And thats coming from somebody who is generally not the biggest SciFi fanIf theres ever a film that the masses should rush out to the cinema to see it is this before its too late An absolute must see and it would be a travesty if it did not make its way to its rightful position in at least the IMDb top ,Positive
This movie has everything The production and cinematography is exceptional The story line is original and forces you to think and challenge your thoughts Its a perfect balance of imaginative and complex The acting lives up to their names to deliver top notch performances,Positive
All of the complaints that I have seen about this movie were ones explaining how viewers did not understand the movie Honestly the movie is really simple to follow if you pay attention Ive only seen it one time and I understood everything Many are saying that they want to see it twice in order to grasp everything but one viewing is enough if comprehension is all you want to get out of the second viewing This being said I would love to see this movie a second time The acting is outstanding and the chemistry between the actors makes the movie so pleasant to watch You instantly forget that these are actors The chemistry between Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt is phenomenal Also Leonardo is unbelievable as always and no one can look better in a suit The topic is so engaging and I would recommend this movie to anyone It has been my favorite movie so far this year and I will definitely be purchasing it as soon as it comes out onto DVD Spend the money see the movie pay attention and everything will be great,Positive
Why are people going mental over this MatrixPaprika wannabe Its undeservingly credited for way to many things Maybe Im being too harsh since its the best blockbuster in the last two years but lets be honest The first half of the movie is drowning in clichs and the rule show dont tell is not being utilized at all Am I the only one who finds those tedious dialogues when they explain the whole plot as if we were ten year olds  really annoying The real people in those situations would talk and react completely differently That makes the character interactions and conversations barely believable and just emptyAlso actors who play Saito and Mal are really destroying any credibility of the drama and tension movie has Saito besides being a Morpheus wannabe always talks as if he was simply happy he remembered the lines And why oh why do they have such unnatural bad and forced accents Ellen Page was a bad choice too another clich  younger student learns everything sensei has to say in  min and then teaches HIM a lesson DiCaprio wasted his talent here his powerful acting was ruined by the forced tension of the movie and a lousy soundtrack which apparently never stopsThe second half of the movie was better and combined with the end gave a certain satisfaction in terms of mental food Nolan really is a master of plot and king of moments  unfortunately this is obviously becoming his biggest weakness The overall impression is it could have been a LOT better Its not awful but giving it a  and calling it a benchmark is just ridiculous,Positive
This movie is perfect Best movie of all time If you havent watched it yet please do,Positive
I m waiting for this movie like since an yeari finally watched itI always say this thing Christopher Nolan is a fing geniusnd i m sure gonna keep his portrait in my roomwithin a few daysi loved itthis fin movie is simply fin brilliant nd awesomethis is one of the best films ive ever seenthis movie is a complete mind gamethis movie has a typical screenplayif u miss  secu miss a lotit was like a puzzleall the time i m watchin this moviei m completely immersed into iti m thinking a lot trying to understand it perfectlythis movie gives a lot of work to ur brainby the time the movie finished every thing look different for some timethe screenplay is damn greatand Leonardo DeCaprio did a gr jobhe had his two best movies this yearShutter Island nd now Inceptionnd he really deserves themi loved this moviein fact i liked this movie more than The Dark Knightthis movie is a must must watch,Positive
The first movie that I saw of this guy was Memento and I was so much thrilled that I couldnt sleep the whole night and then Batman revival follows through Batman Begins and I was wondering how can one get lucky all the time but he again proved me wrong with Prestige Then again i felt that this would be last but Dark Knight as the world knows overshadowed everything that the world had seen so far And I said to myself wait a minute this seems to be too much too good to be true so I went to see Inception in fear mingled with excitement that this has to be a flop but my heart wanted it to be a good movieand oh my dear I couldnt believe what I saw what I heard and what I experienced and was so tremendously elevated by this supreme intelligent movie that i pinched myself to check if Im in a real world or a dream world Simply the most magnificent movie of his era and the best was not the way Christopher Nolan thought but the way he could somehow managed to show in form of cinema Truly a super class act a Masterpiece Hats off to Nolan and brilliant acting by LeonardodeCaprio Ellen Page and other supporting folks,Positive
This movie is the one with the most original screenplays Ive watched it two times and one of which was in a cinema theater and I can say that this was one of the best movie expierences ive had ever,Positive
Watching Inception with its futuristic emphasis on getting inside peoples heads through dreams especially hearing Leonardo DiCaprio explain the pitfalls to newbie Ellen Page I couldnt help thinking about Forbidden Planet and that warning about monsters from the Id Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could notChristopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times it still is an unmistakable masterpiece Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and hes essentially a cat burglar of the mind His mission usually is to invade peoples dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent But Leos also a wanted manSome problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate Cillian Murphy Its not to steal anything but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on othersVery nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolans dialog with verve and conviction I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought,Positive
So perfect mental ideas  the timeline is perfect  nolan you are brilliant,Positive
I first started watching Nolan movies with Memento like  years ago when I was a teenager then went to the cinema to see all three of his Batman movies The Prestige Inception and InterstellarI really think that it can be hard to decide which of his movies truly is his definitive best as he has a few that hit the mark just right But from rewatching them a bunch over the years I do feel that Inception hits the hardest even though Interstellar and The Dark Knight have their own weighty effect different from InceptionI watch movies for the magic and emotion and even though The Dark Knight is technically excellent and brilliantly acted the strengths of Inception edge it out slightly I thinkI love the cast of Inception especially the incredible performances of Joseph GordonLevitt Cillian Murphy Marion Cotillard and Ellen PageThose four actors in this movie are pure magic especially accented with Leo DiCaprio Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe along with everyone elseThe holy trinity of Nolan in my mind at least are Inception Interstellar and The Dark Knight with The Prestige and Memento not far behindI cant wait to see Nolan make an even greater magnum opus one to dethrone Shawshank Redemption from its imdb number  spot I feel that if any living director can do it it would be Nolan,Positive
Ill be the first one to admit that INCEPTION is the kind of thinking mans thriller that has something going on every second of its twohour and  minute running time But only director Chris Nolan knows what its all about and I dont believe Ill find out all the explanations until I get the DVD commentaryIts a heady mixture of scifi comic book stuff and fantasy and all of it is focused on the mastery of dream invasion in order to gather secrets held in the human mind Foremost among the players is LEONARDO DiCAPRIO playing his role in a very authoritative manner with no shortage of barking orders and furrowed brow all highly intense as he gathers a team around him to investigate the dreamscapeTheres plenty of action along the way interspersed with quieter moments of explanatory dialog so the audience has at least some semblance of whats going on But the whole concept of the story lacks the kind of credibility that would have made the film more engaging than it really isCredit the actors with doing their best despite the fact that none of them have roles that are fully fleshed out And this includes Joseph GORDONLEVITT ELLEN PAGE TOM HARDY CILLIAN MURPHY KEN WATANABE and TOM BERENGERIf youre a MATRIX fan youll love this one If not you may wonder what all the fuss was aboutFrankly I had more fun exploring dream invasion in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET less intellectual but a lot more fun,Positive
Christopher Nolans Inception is amongst the Best Films Ever Made Usually films have their share of minuses and flaws surprise surprise surprise Inception is the first film since The Shawshank Redemption that stabs words like Flaw and Minus Nolans lucid dream is brought to life with Inception What happens when you enter the World of Dreams and its motives is so unusual so interesting so gripping and so amazing that your left asking for more By now you know what this Masterstorke is about but believe me you have no idea whats in store for you Inception grabs your attention from the very start and as mentioned before leaves you awestruck And yes Inception packs in THE Best Climax Ever Its simply astoundingNolan makes his careers best film in Inception His screenplay is EPIC and his direction should land him an AcademyAward for Best Director Wally Pfisters cinematography is sure to compliment him with numerous awards in the coming time Music by Hans Zimmer as always is perfectEach and Every Actor excels overhere Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead and steals the show The staractor becomes Dom Cobb and delivers a memorable performance Ellen Page is fantastic Marion Cotillard is magnificent Michael Caine in a brief role is flawless Tom Hardy is very good this is his best performance to date Joseph GordonLevitt gets a role of a lifetime and he sinks his teeth into it Ken Watanabe is stylish while Cillian Murphy is highly efficient Tom Berenger is perfect Dileep Rao is goodOn the whole Nolans Inception is worth your time and money Let me put it this way If your a CinemaFan than watching Inception is a must Two Big Thumbs Up,Positive
To be fair the movie may be a bit hard to follow without any prior knowledge or for those who struggle with information overloads However i found it an excellent film that kept me thinking and engaged Few movies are this engaging as many feel like you well are watching a film With Inception you feel immersed in the filmIt is definitely a very thought provoking film and was very well shot One of the best movies ever made if I must say It is an extremely clever film with an fairly original plot The entire idea of dreams within dreams is fascinating and exciting as well,Positive
This movie is the best film made by Nolan MANY PEOPLE relate this film to Matrix I dont get it Both these films are different,Positive
Inception is a spectacular movie with twists turns and incredible effects Nolan blew my expectations away with this movie,Positive
Best movie ever made Period Not for smallbrained people You need to really think hard to fully understand the concepts and details in this movie Layers deep it covers every emotion throughout watching  acting and the casting was flawless Leo portrays a desperate protagonist you never stop rooting for despite his flaws The concept of planting an idea into anothers subconscience that they assume to be their own original idea  mindbending mindaltering mindincepting greatness This is a movie you must pay attention every second of every scene otherwise youll be confused Nolans best work by far took over a decade alone to write Not sure a movie of this depth will ever be matched By the end of the film if your not completely blown away in awe chances are youre lost Though it takes place in a near future where dreams can be infiltrated it remained completely believable throughout Enjoy and remember pay attention ,Positive
Brilliant technical wizardry Heady at least apparently so A ride more than a movie but a movie none the less Chris Nolan is rapidly becoming the director of his generation and Im longing to find out what is he trying to say He has established his technical power again and again but if I think of Memento for instance I remember the gimmick but not what the story was really about I suspect the same will be said of Inception Im not putting down Im just wondering I left the theater full of questions and nobody could actually give me any answers Im not talking about the plot but at the way Christopher Nolan chose to tell the story Leonardo Di Caprio is acquiring some extra gravitas as an adult presence on the screenLoved Cillian Murphy I always do Riveted by Tom Hardy Enchanted by Marion Cotillard Amused by Joseph GordonLevitt and delighted by Ellen Page I wonder what Mr Nolan will do for an encore,Positive
Specific and unique plot Excellent cast and soundtracks Interesting special effectsNolan knows how to create a tense atmosphere in filmsSomething was missing in the movie,Positive
This movie must quite literally be a DREAM come true for manyFirst for MrNolan himself If he is by any chance watching the screening of the movie amongst general public he must be delighted with the fact that  of the audience would be simply spellbound  must be scratching their heads till they start balding  would be shouting I hate MrNolan for he took them into a maze that lasted for  minutes and did not tell them the way out of it Sheer genius Is he a human being at all Then for the cast If they ever had dreams of acting in roles that are so complete and original in every possible sense then they can stop acting now and retire for all they can dream of has been achieved in a single movie Hats off to the entire cast Last but never the least for us  the audience This is what we secretly hope when we buy a ticket for a movie that we get our moneys worth for every cent we pay for I am pretty sure most people wont even hesitate to pay for the second time to watch the masterpiece that is InceptionAnd oh by the way Spoilers Haha If you have not watched the movie do not worry a jot No amount of spoilers can reveal the actual story This movie is beyond all that Just make sure you go in with a open mind because when you come out of the theater I bet you would have thousands of ideas running around in your head like headless chicken It is a movie experience unparalleled We doff our hat in respect MrNolan for your Idea has been etched onto our mind probably forever You Sir have achieved Inception,Positive
The director is a real genius The point is hes young This is a film that is close to perfect in every detail from the writers to the actors from the cinematography to the score,Positive
Many people are saying that Christopher Nolan may be the best film maker of his generation I thoroughly enjoyed Memento thought Batman Begins was great thought The Dark Knight was fantastic and after watching Inception I think the man is a cinematic genius and cant wait for his next project But I will have lots of enjoyment watching Inception many times over until thenHe supposedly honed this script for  years and it definitely shows The story is quite complex and has not a plot hole in it that I was able to observe It has everything  loss redemption amazing action great character development mindblowing effects that serve the story and not the other way around as many films do nowadays and at the core is a love story not too unlike Orpheus and Eurydice But unlike the myth the underworld is a damaged soul And when it looks like the story is wrapped up theres a last second twist that will throw you for a loopWhat the Matrix did for virtual reality  Inception does for dreams and takes it even deeper This is a film where spoilers might ruin your sense of wonder and discovery watching this film for the first time so I wont give you any But what I will say is that if you took What Dreams May Come crossed it with the Matrix Mission Impossible and threw in a good measure of a Phillip K Dick quality sciencefiction story  you would be heading in the right directionThe hype is real You will not be disappointed Go see this film,Positive
Alright folks I saw the same movie you saw My wife and I both went into this with great expectations Visually the movie was interesting Beyond that it was hohum for us I felt myself fidgeting in the seat several times wondering when they were going to get to the point The film was about  minutes too long The concept is very interesting but there are so many loopholes and unanswered questions and illogical contrivances that we both just shook our heads and enjoyed the scenery I have to wonder where all of the high ratings for this flick are coming from I am not buying that as many people loved this thing on the same par as Lord of the Rings and Godfather This movie was so pumped up that I was hoping for something brilliant like The Matrix I feel like I got something more similar to The Happening,Positive
I went into this movie with low expectations and once this film started it took my expectations strapped it to a rocket and took off This film was by far one of the most creative mindblowing drama driving thrillers that Ive seen in at least  years The acting was very solid on all parts when it came to fear solving problems chemistry and action The score was magnificent dark deep suspenseful and very escalating You find yourself at points of the film on the edge of your seat hoping that all the characters make it through okay especially with their own unique talents and the actors made these characters seem so real that youll have to pinch yourself and make sure that you are not the one that is in the dream world I will see this movie at least  more times and I will not be surprised if it wins one or two Oscars at least,Positive
Dont read a single iota of plot about this Watch it What I will tell you is that DiCaprio may not have been better and is getting better the older he gets the rest of the cast are amazing especially Tom Hardy and GordonLevitt the cinematography is at times breathtaking Hans Zimmers score is intoxicating with Johnny Marr on guitar and it travels across continents like a Bond movie Oh yeah and its really really loud in parts But this is about Christopher Nolan again He has crafted a serious adult thriller that happens to have exhilarating action sequences that importantly dont detract from the emotional content and a plot you will have to sit and think about Its amazing that in a time of remakes and sequels that a director is given carte blanche to do what he wants and returns something as gratifying as this Stunning Why are you still reading this Go Watch Now,Positive
Amazing Every time I watch Inception I find something new This is a stunning scifi film with lots of suspense and plot twists The action begins in the first minute of the film and keeps you captivated until the end I was absolutely blown away the first time I watched this film and every time since This is a film about a man named Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio and a team of people who are tasked with invading Robert Fischers Cillian Murphy consciousness through his dreams The physiologically thrilling story is perhaps Christopher Nolans greatest film and will amaze you The sensational story stunning visuals amazing effects and mindblowing ideas make Inception a mustsee It truly amazes me how anyone could come up with a story as unique and compelling as this,Positive
This is not only the best movie ever made about dreams it is also one of the best films of  and certainly one of the most entertaining pictures Ive seen in a decade A groundbreaking intriguing exhilarating and brilliant scifi thriller thats destined to become a timeless classic Mark my words It will be remembered for years to come Inception is elegantly realised DiCaprio powerfully embodies a tortured soul while GordonLevitt has all the fun in the best action sequence This is a drama built around ideas and images it is a cinematic maze that Nolan makes his audience traverse in order to follow understand and appreciate his world It makes The Matrix look like a Dick  Jane book The final halfhour alone is a miracle of clockworkprecise showmanship IF you are going to vote less than too badIm really disappointed This Movie Deserves  and The NO Spot,Positive
Inception is a resplendent cinematic experience that had me hooked from the opening scene till the very end As a viewer I was enthralled by its intricate plot The characters in Inception are deeply nuanced and expertly portrayed by a remarkable ensemble cast The chemistry between the cast members is palpableVisually Inception is a feast for the eyes Inception demands your full attention to grasp its intricacies it requires active engagement and a willingness to navigate its twists and turns Some may find its complexity overwhelmingInception is a cinematic marvel that pushes the boundaries of storytelling Does it qualify as what is known as a masterpiece Yes However SOMETHING just something held me back from a  rating Im not quite sure what but theres just something small missing to get it to that perfect ratingIn conclusion would I watch it a second time Yes Would I recommend you to watch it for the first time Yes,Positive
Inception might have been a better movie  and would certainly have been more entertaining  had writerdirector Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire  running time explaining itself to its audienceSeriously the exposition Never Stops There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character which of course was a hamfisted way of explaining it to us But even with all of that aggressive exposition the movie never does make a lot of sense The result is a lot of busyness  oh theres always plenty of stuff going on  thats nevertheless pretty boring because its never clear what all of the busyness is forNolan has done this to us before Who the hell came out of The Prestige with any clue what that movie was about And even his more narratively coherent films like The Dark Knight suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises cant support Inception is no exception ha The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junkGrade C,Positive
"My personal all time favorite movieEverything about this movie is so perfect The acting the plotline the idea behind the plot the action the emotion the adrenaline the soundtrack the look Such a beautifully well crafted movie that I keep understanding new things each time I rewatch it I personally am more of an action kind of moviewatcher so keep that bias in mind
The movie admittedly is difficult to understand the first time you watch it but is still quite enjoyable But I love how the movie gets more enjoyable as you rewatch it There are so many movies that Im like eh watched it solid wouldnt really care to watch again but this movie isnt made up of the movie junk food thats in most movies",Positive
This movie is an absolute masterpiece The story is incredible paired with amazing acting unforgettable music and beautiful cinematography This movie really deserves everything Easily one of the best movies of all time,Positive
It went too big Personally there was just something wrong with Nolans interpretation of the whole dream thing I got uber bored and i thought most of the stuff was too predictable People were freaking out saying this was the best film ever and it was mindblowing and all that jazz i FELT THERE WERE TO MANY PLOT HOLES AND GOT SICK OF THE FILM ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH It was truly not even remotely as good as it was made out to be  It wasnt as good as it was supposed to be  I didnt end up liking any of the characters that much  Nolans fanboys get on my nerves  I have a friend who obnoxiously is obsessed with Nolan and that makes me biased  I had higher expectations based on Nolans previous films,Positive
"Amazing movie
I was fascinated with the idea of controling our dreams the I even looked up on lucid dreaming But I just get no results D",Positive
Until now it is no  in my list I want share experience after watching this movie I feel different no movie got this feeling for the first in my life I cant explain my feeling but I know my mind cant think for few minutesi see this movie in regional language that why I understand in first watch after watch in englishthen I more understand about movie first time I watch I went with the story at end I feel like mind blowing experience in my mind,Positive
From the starting till the end it was dream and dream At the ending for sure everyone will sit breathlessly and ask himself How a movie can be this good,Positive
Very long and drawn out Im not sure how this got so many good ratings I could barely make it through to the end Actually I forwarded through some of the neverending scenes of various ridiculousness That wasnt much acting It was mostly just running around shooting things and blowing things up Cillian Murphy is such a good actor but there wasnt much acting going on here It mightve been some special effects wires and such but what was the point I think the whole story couldve been told in  minutes Kind of a waste of my time and I wish I could get my money back Sorry for being so negative,Positive
Style over Substance might be a KneeJerk Negative Reaction to this Messy Film But that would be Kind There is no Style or Substance to Waste many BrainCells Considering The Movies Conceit is to make You want to Think Think NotIt tries so Very Hard with its Explanations about Dreams dont do a drinking game taking a shot every time the word dream is mentioned you will be dead by intermission Also Wordy Incomprehensible Insertions about the Teams Method used here to Infiltrate and Control the Minds of Corporate Clients now there is a group we can morally supportThis is so Unnecessarily Complicated that it causes Viewer Fatigue and by Proximation Sleepiness early on and Waking Up or Recovering from that is not a Given The Result is just not Caring about Anyone or Anything that is happening on the Screen What is happening is kind of Drab and Dull for a DreamscapeIf you buy the Premise and go along for the Ride better fasten your SeatBelts because it is anything but Smooth It Bumps and Jumps from Dream to Dream and Layer upon Layer of Intellectual Gobbledygook that is so Very Uninteresting and Without much Pathos The Music is forever in Swelling Mode and Ripples throughout and is Pretentious and IntrusiveIn the End some have trouble making it that far there is a you decide Twist that is not really a Twist because after all You Decide But it is hardly Worth it and when all is Said and Done too much has been Said and not enough has been Done Vastly Overrated,Positive
"Inception is a movie you just have to see before you judge it Maybe you should even see it twice There are a lot of complex ideas here and the movie spends a good chunk of time explaining them in the opening act
That main idea though is something very unique and creative that is brought to life by outstanding filmmaking everything youd expect from a Christopher Nolan film Writing and performances are also great across the board The only problem with Inception is in ones own interpretation Some may says its pretentious and the ideas presented acctualy arent fully understood by the creators andor dont make sense But I think thats a terrible angle to approach the film Its SciFi youre not supposed to overanylasie it in that way Its meant to plant thought provoking ideas in your head which I beleive it does very well not be a perfectly logical and plausible idea Yes it does have a few questionable sequences and scenarios esspecally at the end but it doesnt drag the rest of the movie down at all to me Its a must watch",Positive
This movie never gets old Of Christopher Nolans movies it is the one i have watched the most outside of The Dark Knight This really feels like a movie that only he could make A mind bogling mix of ideas and creativity as the concept of dreams are told to the viewer in a way so that it never becomes too much This is one of those movies that hooks you from beginning to endThe plot is engaging and you never know what to expect as the movie builds up and becomes more and more intense and thrilling This is also a journey of guilt confronting yourselves and learning to move on Directing is amazing with some truelly iconic scenes such as the hallway fight which is expertly made and filmed Soundtrack is equally great and iconicGreat actors who all does a great job Lots of talent The ending still remains one of my favorite movie endings of all time This is a once in a lifetime experience that you dont wanna miss,Positive
even if you go in with high expectations you will come out astonishingly praising the director and the crew in mindyesChris Nolan has done it againyou wont even take an eye or your mind even for a second till the endonce again Nolan has proved that not every thing depends on how great the story was but the way you present itwith an exceptional directing skillsgood castinghaunting music by Hans Zimmer and a brilliant editing and cinematographyinception blew you minds off and special Thanks to the outstanding performances from DiCaprio and GordonLevittThe reason for loving this film is that its not a kind of rubbish meaningless high budget action flickyou have to keep your memory in mind to watch this movie from the very inceptionA must watch movie worths your every single penny spent on itcheers to Chris Nolan  for his dreamsdont miss it in theaters in one word Inception is Exceptional,Positive
This is not a bad film per se had it been about  minutes shorter I would not have been too offended But Im genuienly perplexed as to how people can rave over it on all time list at time of writing There is virtually no character devlopment the plot overly complicated and riddled with holes and contradictions Frankly you dont need to suspend disbelief so much has have it surgically removed and flushed down the toilet By the end I was wishing I was in a dream within a dream policed by a completely arbitrary set of nonsence rules  any thing to get me out of that chair,Positive
"That fact this movie has an 
Rating shows peoples desire to be perceived as being intelligent This movie is unnecessarily complicated for the sake of being complicated The story telling is terrible If a character in a story has to tell the audience directly what the hell is going on the story sucks A lot of Christopher Nolans stuff is like this Whenever someone hears criticism of Inception the first line of attack is you just didnt understand it I understood it just didnt like the way it was presentedHaving said that Christopher Nolan has a lot of original ideas and some of his stuff is good He is still one of the only directors today that uses practical effects The hallway rotating scene with Joseph Gordon Levitt was a practical effect and was amazing Scenes like that was the only reason I rated Inception a ",Positive
This movie is not complicated This movie is not complex This movie is an excellently acted excuse to put the most astounding weaving together of action sequences ever performed on filmIts mindnumbingly beautiful and if you ever saw an action movie you liked this movie is close to perfection This movie is literally a movie that will make you edge forward on your cinema seat and if you feel you have outgrown action movies then this flick will make you  againThe actors are good and they close together the gaps in the action effectively and quickly The cutting is probably the finest I have ever seen and the music orchestrates the events perfectlySee it,Positive
I loved it OK I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and I love dark movies with great twists I loved MementoPrestige I had to watch it twice to understand itI have seen dreams inside dreams inside dreams so I got the movie from the moment it started I will not spoil it too much but everything in the movie are explained clearly The mystery of the movie is inside the mind of Cobb He is hiding his subconscious guilt and still playing the game of inception with his team members This is the most difficult job he has to do and all the time he is haunted by his wife The movie is understandable Leonardo Dicaprios one of the best performance after The Blood Diamond Ellen Page is absolutely the character Nolan wanted from her She is a brilliant architect and also curious about all the mysteries that goes around Cobbs life This is the first movie I have seen of Joseph GordonLevitt I loved his character balanced and funny sometimes This is the first movie of this summer that I am going to watch a second time and may be third,Positive
This movie is high energy but the problem with that is that it never stops There is no contrast to it High tension the entire time No release and it wears out quickly to the point you dont even want to finish watching it Too much repetition was included in this movie Action sequences were too long and added nothing to the story It needed a film editor to cut about an hour of it just to make it watchableThen there is the plot A plot which was thinning wrapped around all the action and special effects You got the feeling that you were watching a computer video game and not an actual story Far too much distraction and time spent on the lead characters personal life problem and he trying to deal with it,Positive
After watching the midnight premiere my friends and I came up with a theory behind Christopher Nolan and his Inception movie While he was making Inception Christopher Nolan needed more funding therefore he decided to make the Dark Knight Sadly Heath Ledger passed away but his death brought more fame and fortune than Nolan expected He was planning on reusing ALL actors in the Dark Knight but Christian Baile went on a dramaqueen rampage on set against the lighting director causing Nolan to lean towards DiCaprio as his lead This came about because Nolan happened to be sipping tea with Scorsese one lovely evening discussing Shutter Island and how fantastically adorable DiCaprio was in thrillers The Dark Knight was at best a side project because what Director Christopher Nolan REALLY had in mind was to F with our sense of reality through HIS thriller InceptionNo movie has ever caused me physical pain except this one i was cringing from suspense Every muscle in my body ached my lungs were collapsed and when i tried to stand up after the credits i just couldnt i just could not BREATHE my eyes still sting why because the entire movie my eyes were GLUED to the screen and i probably blinked oh lets say ZERO times driving back from the theater i lost my voice raving about the movie with my friends and Hans Zimmer i made my own Hollywood Star for him in the backyard the grass spell out his name i loved this movie Pick and pull at it all you want it was fantastic,Positive
After experiencing NOLANs earlier worksThe Prestige Memento  Dark Knight i actually have a faith on INCEPTION And guess what i was absolutely right INCEPTION is by most NOLANs finest combination of storytelling  action at the same time with same pace The amazing concept of dreams and thieves mixed up in a very cinematic way that take your breath away The very first frame of the movie itself told the audiences that they are watching something extraordinary HANZ ZIMMER awesome BG score keeps the movie alive and fantastic Visual Fx makes it more real and terrific in every senseso DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR go and watch INCEPTION,Positive
Upon reviewing the Dark knight I had said that a director such as Nolan was being wasted in Batman sequels regardless of their quality And that was because Nolan is one the few directors in Hollywood able to create something truly original and as such should not be adding branches to fully grown treesInception proves the validity of my claim but it does so in ways that surprised mePerhaps the most immediate distinction between Inception and the Dark Knight is an improved sense of pacing It doesnt feel like narrative put in a blender like the batman movie did despite its scope each scene is warranted plenty of time and the use of more traditional associative cuts allow it to flow betterThe movie itself is difficult to describewhich is a nonissue because it requires itself to be experienced to be understoodAnother area Nolan seems to be grasping is in directing actors I always liked Leonardo DiCaprio but his mannerisms at times can be the thing obstructing a good actor from becoming great In Inception all his mannerisms are gone and this is finest performance everThe special effects are incredibly well done which means they dont look like CGI even when they are However one of its greatest technical achievements is the sound editing perfectly balancing the several momentums of the scenesWishing to provide no spoilers at all Ill just say it isnt nearly as complicated as some have named it but it is a complex conceptI cannot compliment this movie enough It is the most engaging film experience I have had in a long long long time My advice is dont miss it in the theaters Dont miss it when it come to DVD Dont miss it any chance you getYou wont regret it,Positive
This movie just ruined my imagination as it is so complex and thrillingly amazing it will get on ones mind and word as an adhesive making you stick to the edge of your seats till you give up in front of its elegance maturity A wonder full screenplay and a cinematic extravaganza a movie to be preserved Leonardo Di Carpio is amazing It is a clear ace Watch it for his story and the wonderful concept of an idea being a crime scene this is heck of a good thriller good this is the best of the best Kudos to Christopher Nolan for gifting us with the following memento insomnia batman begins the prestige the dark knight and his best inception,Positive
This film has great effects That is about all I can say because I found its plot instantly forgettable Slickly directed it is a visual treatLeonardo D is solid as usual Ellen Page is good but she suffers from looking too young to have qualified as an architectI would struggle to think of any reason to recommend this film to anyone to watch because beyond the sight of Paris folding over there is nothing else to recommend Not enough tension within the plot so I didnt actually care about the charactersLooks good but not a great film,Positive
There are much better films than this with a similar concept or just better writing Its not that anything necessarily went wrong here the concept is OK the story is OK the script is OK the acting might be even better than OK I guess that leaves the production and direction And of course a majority of its reviewers disagree with me so whatever This just isnt a great movie It certainly isnt worthy of its rating and status here and a lot of other places I think maybe it was over produced and designed If it had been simplified into something more Donnie Darko and less Matrix at least it would have been worthy of its better than average performances,Positive
My mind is aching I have just seen the movie and I really liked it I went to cinema with  other people and all of them were satisfied After Avatar I was very disappointed about cinema But Inception showed that brilliant ideas still exist and it shows that how can you apply visual effects to tell a story not just to show off It has something new to offer Im not a fan of science fiction movies specially ones with strange creatures What makes me to like Inception this much is the fact that it picks one real thing something we encounter every day our dreams and takes us to the unknown world of dreaming I loved Matrix at its time and Im loving Inception It feels more real than every other SciFiction movie I have ever seen Worth watching absolutely recommendable,Positive
I went into this movie expecting one of the best movies of all time However that is not what I saw The runtime is extremely long and I found myself checking the time several times throughout the film It was an interesting film to see but it definitely does not belong on a list with the likes of Shawshank or Godfather The story was very confusingThere seemed to be plot holes and loose story lines that were never really tied up The concept of the film is very intriguing and you will leave the theater wondering what it was all about However the atmosphere of some of the scenes felt very similar to Shutter Island for me I almost felt like Leonardo DiCaprio did not really have to act much as he was basically playing a character similar to that of Teddy Daniels Hope he isnt going to spend the rest of his career playing that same character It was also nice to see Ellen Page in something besides Juno She can be more than a snarky pregnant teenager Also The visual effects are extremely welldoneI am not a fan of Nolans work The Dark Knight was a film that I could never understand why there was so much hype It was average to me at best Inception however is much better than MementoIt is a film that you must see just because the concept is very interesting but it is not something that you can watch over and over again,Positive
I thought the movie was absolutely horrible It was truly a waste of money I tried to get my money back but didnt leave within  minutes of the movie so I had to sit through the retarded bizarre movie Who ever gave this four stars should be shot If Leonardo couldve read my dreams while I fell asleep during the movie he would not have been flattered Maybe I didnt get the concept of the movie but it was annoying how they kept going from one dream to another dream to skiing and snow mobiles then a van driving off a bridge then to a guy floating down a hallway then to his wife and kids All for corporate espionage Who cares about the company I wish there was something redeeming about the movie but I couldnt think of anything We did have a good laugh about how bad it was so that should account for something If anyone reading this wants to pay me back the money I wasted on the movie I will gladly accept it After the movie we went to see Salt which I thought was excellent and very entertaining,Positive
It seems like Leonardo DiCaprio is really going for these Psychological thrillers lately which is good as he seems to pull it off quite nicelyAs usual Christofer Nolan has created another great movie which is well shot superbly acted and grips your attention from scene   although at that point you really have no idea what is going on My one point of criticism on an otherwise amazing movie is that he takes the concept one step too far Towards the end keeping up with whats happening where becomes a full time task and although I dont want to come over as stupid one less would have made the film flow much smootherEnjoy,Positive
Just when u think that Chris Nolan cant come up with a movie of the same league as the dark knight he comes up with inception  mins of pure genius an instant classic it is well on its way to be the movie of the decade or maybe even more From start to finish this movie just holds your attention and you witness something that u cant even dream ofEvery single thing in the movie seems to be picture perfect each and every character has been well portrayed and justified in its own wayThe only problem i had was that i didnt want the movie to get over i just wanted to be a part of his dream world to conclude i would just say that Chris Nolan is on his way to be recognized as one of the very best the world has ever seen,Positive
Christopher Nolan is one director who has never failed to deliver  his latest film Inception is no different With this he has created a monumental  thoroughly original piece of cinema that not only entertains but makes you think something that modern blockbusters have failed to do time  time again eg Avatar Transformers Clash Of The TitansLeonardo DiCaprio leads a sublime ensemble cast that includes some of todays biggest  brightest stars and a true legend in Michael Caine while Leo himself delivers arguably his greatest performance yetThe film looks  feels stunning The visuals are topnotch the film sounds suitably tense while Hanz Zimmers score only adds to the atmosphere The script is as you would expect brilliant remaining complex but relatively easy to follow  Nolan has once again stayed clear of conventional narrative to heighten the films complexitiesThis is a true original  just goes to show everyone that blockbusters can be intellectually challenging whilst remaining hugely enjoyable As a result one cant help but want more from a standout film in a year that surely has more to offer than it has produced thus far A new dimension of boundarybreaking has just been created by the new Kubrick  Hitchcock of film,Positive
To describe Inception in a single adjective will never be enough The sheer magnitude at which this movie happens is simply exceptional It couldve only been pulled off by someone as good as Chris Nolan I can go on and on about praising this movie was hours thats months in dream level one and years in dream level two Put it simply this is the best movie Ive watched in my life because of its idea its execution and its emotional depth People always moan about Nolans movies not being emotional but this one is definitely not one of them You will feel for Cobb and Mal Di Caprio has done a terrific job showing the vulnerabilities and guilt of Cobb Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt have given neat performances Tom Hardy was simply brilliant in the way he handled Eames Cilian as usual has done job well The rest of the cast have done a good job as well The cinematography by Wally Pfister is one of the best in recent times Hans Zimmers music is haunting Editing by Lee Smith is top notch But this film truly belongs to Nolan From the storyline to its execution Nolan oozes confidence in every department Be it narration bringing awestriking visuals or keeping us on the edge of our seats he has truly demonstrated that hes not only one of the most entertaining but one of the most intelligent directors in world cinema today For that take a bow Nolan,Positive
Definitely one of the best movies ever made Hats off to the God of cinema  Christopher Nolan,Positive
Of course I had heard lots about this movie and actually love track  from the OST by Zimmer but Id never made an effort to go watch it Something in my mind told me it wouldnt be worth it Besides Im not much impressed by DiCaprios acting skillsStill after a long while I wanted to see what the fuss is about I am checking out numerous films people recommend as best of  to meInception was waaaaay too shallow for me Its a superficial action film that admittedly looks visually nice but theres no real drama It actually bored me Left me coldIf you want to see a  film including DiCaprio go see Shutter Island Much much better but not great which is too badAnyway I dont want to spend too many words on this Inception creation Yawn,Positive
There are movies that I love initially Then over a period of time it dawns on me that I have been manipulated royally And then the love I had for the movie turns into dislike then hate and depending upon the intensity with which I had initially loved the movie it turns into utter disgust Titanic tops my list of such movies Inception comes a close second Christ what was all that about Dreams within dreams within dreams come on Tops spinningnot spinning People getting into each others dreams Visually breathtaking it may have been but a great story it certainly wasnt I think the true test of a classic movie is in its repeat viewing I realized Inception was nothing when I sat down to watch it again I couldnt go past the first  minutes It was that boring Somehow my brain refused to suspend disbelief and seemed to yell switch the damn DVD offAnd I didBTW Chris Nolan tops my list of the most overrated directors I still cant forgive him for those utterly dull climatic fight scenes in The Dark Night Rises,Positive
inception it begins with confusion the movie ends with standing ovationin between there is a dream of Nolan that bounds n mesmerizes you dark knight  batman begins n mementoare piece of fine craft but this movie brings Nolan in bracket of Cameroons Spielbergs n leanshope you enough iedream of Nolans master craft acting DiCaprios in lead enough said hans beats chills you out for this movie hope after inceptionit is only inception of further great works from NOLANOscar who gives a damncarry on but please make movie every year ,Positive
Christopher Nolan is a GeniusNothing new in thatBut the new thing is that he had paired with DiCaprio this timeDiCaprio already has gem this year with Shutter Island and now the count increases to twoThe first hour of the movie tells you everything and you wonder what is left in the next hour and here comes the actionWhat was told in the previous hour was shown practicallyThis Movie contains  layers and a surprising and revealing th layerThe concept is brilliant direction top notch and acting sufficientThe music by Hanzzimmer is hauntingI earnestly hope that this movie bags few OscarsLet this movie be honoredOne surely remembers MATRIX during the movieThough the concept is quite differentthe in differentiation between reality and dreaming reminds you of MatrixAnyways this is quite originalhats off NOLANBut definitely if you expect some real mindless action youll be disappointedThis is Brainy thriller which keeps the viewer thinking and guessingSo all you people who just wants a movie for entertainmentStay outThe remaining just enjoy this movie with your heads onFilm Making at its Best I gave it  on  only because I saw it just twiceMy rating might get higher on repeated viewings,Positive
I really dont want to talk at all about the plot or the characters too much as its impossible not to give something away Its really best if you go into this movie knowing what the trailers tell and thats it The performances are absolutely superb The acting is simply wonderful Page and DiCaprio steal the show You must go into this movie on a full stomach with your thinking cap on though I do not advise eating or drinking during the film as one bathroom break will wreck the whole experience for you The film making here is absolutely topnotch The special effects are tastefully rendered and do not take away from the film at all  from this moviegoer Ive yet to find a significant flaw that could motivate me enough to drop it to ,Positive
"Christopher Nolan is probably the best film maker the world has ever known he can take a wild imaginary fiction idea and reconstruct it to be realistic so the audience can almost see it in the real world without loosing the excitement of this idea
I cant count the number of times that I have rewatched this movie and it still gives me the same amount of the wow feeling every single time it is my all time favourite movie",Positive
This is just an average big budget Hollywood movieDont expect any complexity or depth from it it is simple and quite shallowTechnically its well done the plot is OK the actors are fine the FX are good and hopefully you will have a good time watching the characters running and jumping around ducking bullets and explosions and so on while a VERY SIMPLE AND QUITE SHALLOW psychologicalscifi plot unfoldsBut you wont get much else from itIm giving it a  So folks dont believe the hype about this thing being a fascinating and revolutionary piece of art because ITS NOT Its just another Hollywood commodity out to make big bucks If you want some enlightening psychology read  and dont watch this for cks sakeThere are some really cool effects to this film but the story is so convoluted that it detracts away from the story,Positive
Not far into this film I thought it wasnt for me but my husband will like it But after enduring more than half of it I realised that was an insult to his intelligenceUtterly boring and confused rather than confusing with pointless violence just for the sake of it Will no doubt make a decent computer gameI am giving this  purely for the special effects which are OKIf I never I see another film like this it will be too soonI have never reviewed a movie on here before but I felt I must as that  rating has to change,Positive
With all the big budgets and technology Hollywood can get what did we the audience get Many sequels And I dislike Dark Knight being just a little better sequelSince the Matrix was released more than  years ago what did we the SciFi film fans get compared with a decade or two before that Chris Nolan delivered on these two accounts and fewer and fewer directors in Hollywood can really master in commanding a complicated project and a good story telling at the same time I want more films like Inception coming to theaters here which spent a lot of money making one as well as taking us to experience something other media such as TV games cant offer That is what we trade for paying the ticket to get in a theaterThere is also a philosophical angle for the audience I think When we moviegoers are used to be overpowered by technology hard to distinguish among themselves like computer graphics animation special effects  unavoidably we find ourselves attracted to those with a FORM standing out among all on top of such as acting of any particular roles words of power of any particular scenes FORM of this film will be something many to follow If the derivatives of FORM to this film lead to a new spectrum for film makings then that will be something interesting for us movie lovers to know firstThe only thing I dont get it though  why did Saito and Fischer not recognize each other when they both waked up in the airplane Arent they supposed to know each other being major competitors in the business they are respectively in,Positive
Best movie and director ever i hope see more movie from this director,Positive
It is very rarely that I would feel strongly enough to write a movie review but after I saw inception I felt so captivated by the movie that I decided to write oneIn this film Nolan has delivered a truly spectacular film which deals with the concept of dreams and the possibility that our dreams could somehow be invaded and secrets could be extracted from them The film is centered on the possibility of instead of something being extracted from a dream could an idea be planted in our dream to change our perception on an aspect of our lifeIt is through this brief story outline that Nolan delivers a multi layered masterpiece which sees a group of extractors led by Leonardo Di Caprio try to plant an idea into a dream which leads to some of the most surreal environments seen in a film since the Matrix Even Nolans excellent use of architecture serves to immerse viewers further into this dreamworldNolans casting once again is flawless in this film just like it was in the Batman films and Memento Leonardo Di Caprio delivers a very strong and emotional performance as a man who is struggling with his past and there are also stellar performances from Joseph Gordan Levitt Ellen Page and Tom HardyI will admit that this film is for the thinkers among us as it requires a lot of concentration throughout the film to keep up with the films layered storyline and I am sure there will be more than a few people who will not get it However those of us that like films that push our imagination to the next level will definitely not be disappointedThis is Nolans masterpiece and I hope that it gets the iconic recognition it deserves,Positive
"Movies of this calibre come seldom to neverThis could be a onceinalifetime motion picture to beholdIf you could only watch  film in your life it should be thisnuf saidA truly remarkable achievement Nolan hasnt yet eclipsed even though Interstellar and Tenet came pretty close I feel like this one is still the bestIts an absolute grandiose spectacle on all fronts musicscore editing visual effects acting cinematography writing direction and most imporantly THE VERY CEREBRAL CORE of the movie the urge to engage with it to grasp it fully by watching it more than once the sheer scale of the movie 
LOUD APPLAUSE",Positive
I didnt have high expectations coming into this movie but when I left I decided this was one of the best films I had ever seen This is certainly Nolans best work The acting is exceptional the story line is mindblowing and the action is fantastic Nolans film kept me on the edge of my seat the entire  hours The last hour of the film has to be the greatest theater experience Ive ever had I saw Inception twice as I heard you will get more out of it the second time which was very true If you are unclear on some things the first time you see it go again Its even better the second time You will be thinking about this film days after you see it and probably have some very intense dreams ,Positive
I didnt expect too much from this given Leonardo DiCaprios presence but was surprised how weak and unwatchable it ultimately was This film was nothing but special effects  it was impossible to care about any of the characters and there was nothing truly interesting or thoughtful about it No twists no surprises nothing I was one of the few times I really felt like Id wasted  hours of my life and got nothing out of itNolans earlier Memento was far more original thoughtful and fascinating both throughout and in the ultimate plot reveals The th Floor is a far better execution of a similar theme more straightforward and interestingSave your money and dont waste your time or money on this vastly overrated collection of silly pointless special effects to no apparent purpose,Positive
Let me begin by addressing the criticisms of this film that its either too slow too complicated or superficially emotional All of these claims are completely and utterly misguided and wrongInception is a movie unlike any other It combines heartstopping action mind bending psychological concepts and deep emotional conflicts wraps them in a tight perfectly edited package and drop kicks you with them in the face The cool part is that you wont be surprised at how little you understand but rather how much you understand The scripting and pacing is so well planned and pieced together and everything is explained in the perfect amount of detail which serves to make the end of the movie a mindblowing climax of epic proportionsScoring by Hans Zimmer is to die for Its a mysterious combination of elements of Batman Bourne and Quantum of Solace which are all revolutionary scores and it completes the movie But lets be serious everything completes this movie Joseph GordonLevitt DiCaprio and Ellen Paige all turn in rock star performances The only character that feels underdeveloped is Fischer who comes off as cold but whose emotional transformation isnt entirely convincing Luckily the rest of the movie is so engrossing at every moment that this does not detract from the overall experience Nolan doesnt need to fall back on highbuck CGI either The sets locales and visuals are stunning without being overbearingThese gorgeous visuals ludicrous editing brilliant scoring a synergistic cast and a plot that makes you think and rewards you for your mental effort combine to transform this from a movie into an amazing mental journey,Positive
I just cannot explain how awesomely awesome this movie is Overwhelming but in a completely good way is a very good word to explain this The actors were all SO fantastic There wasnt one of them that wasnt completely believable in their role The FX were just spectacular and really helps to transport you in to this movie The story and whole concept of this Inception thing and how they do it just totally blows your mind I mean it really does This movie made me feel like I had been sitting on the edge of my seat and holding my breath I could not wait for the next whatever to happen and to see how everything played out,Positive
As a fiction writer I very much enjoy creating stories worlds and trying to keep everything tied together ITs a great challenge Christopher Nolan is a genius at creation His movies are groundbreaking and Inception is just another one of his phenomenal creationsThe first  minutes were tough to figure out but later you understand how those scenes were relevant to the story and the rest of it really wasnt that hard for me  it made sense The score was fantastic  I noticed that Nolan loves to infuse music into the film almost the whole time rather than in key moments It adds to the drama  I like itThe acting was very strong Leo is a talented actor and did his thing in this movie The rest of the cast was strong also but I dont know if any of them will win major awards  except maybe the exwife She was great Nolan used a couple of actors from the Batman movies in there  that was interestingOne flaw I could pick on was that it wasnt clear what anyone elses motivation was to finish the Inception job Clearly Leos character had a goal but I couldnt really tell why the others were so loyal and accommodating Maybe I missed the monetary reward offered The reality bend in Inception was done to perfection Rang very similar to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in that regardThe movie was gorgeous to look at The style was similar to his other recent films  and thats a very good thingAnd the ending What can I say it was one of the most satisfying endings Ive ever seen I walked out and just nodded my head Yep Very nice Extraordinarily well done film,Positive
If you think that The Dark Knight was Christophers Best you surely havent seen Inception Theres not a single moment in the movie you wanna miss It just keeps on getting better and better The cast is great but the story is such that it takes all the credit away Kudos to Christopher Nolan You indeed are the pioneer of filmmaking The visual effects are also awesome As usual great background score by Hans Zimmer amazing cinematography gravity defying stunts Hoping that Christopher Nolan continues his streak of blockbuster movies by making one every two years Its just the summer blockbuster you are looking for A summer package of AWESOMENESS,Positive
The movie is about manipulation of dreams and how it can impact a persons psyche Caprio in this movie is a kind of dream terrorist who as a profession extracts information from peoples mind This is espionage of new times and he has become notoriously popular for this However for the last time when he undertakes a job of planting an idea into the mind of an heir to a giant business empire Cillian Murphy  things go wrong I am disappointed by the script The movie is conceptually flawed First of all how can you dream inside a dream I mean how one transitions into next level of sleepiness Even if one could why the machine used to coordinate the dreams also appears the same in the dream and works also Why one would age in a dream I thought in a dream the appearance of oneself is the mental projection of the memory of oneself Same genre has been portrayed by Paprika beautifully and is much more consistent and meaningful than this version of a dreamcontrol fantasyFirst act was a bit interesting but the plot goes haywire towards the end lost in an attempt to incorporate useless actions scenes Ending was as terrible as one would expect after watching the trifling second act Trying to give an inconclusive end was a bit pathetic after what has been done to original idea There was no original inspiration in this movie By the end of it I was in level Certainly a bad one from Nolan This not nearly as good as Following or Prestige No surreal element twisting the city was a fleeting attempt thoughWatchable once and that too would be worthwhile only on a big screen,Positive
The actors were exceptional playing their roles with  adamant skill creating a killer cast which helped propel the movies momentum as it was hyped and psyched up prior to releaseUpon watching the movie each minute was a blast as much as a puzzle itself thinking was imminent and necessary hardly giving you time to lean back and take a bite of your popcorn This movie isnt for you and your girlfriend to be all touchy in but take her along if shes interested into movies which get your mind going like a maths test Come to think about it you can sort of see matrix through the backbone of the movie but it is clearly magical none the less The action scenes were perfectly timed making it adequate rather than overdone and time consuming The dialog which i believe is a VERY important factor to movie success surpassed me blowing my mind away at every moment Leonardo DiCaprio has been on a true roll with a back to back spree with shutter island and now this living up to audience expectations with his actingMind blowing action scenes intellectually battering dialog talented actors and a plot with a very imaginative basis and you get THE TOP MOVIE this year INCEPTION I recommend it to all unless its hard for you to understand complicated movies,Positive
Like many other out there who have been reading about all the hype Inception has been bringing the World Wide Web and possible your friends I got to the movie theater as soon as I could to watch it And let me tell you this movie has a whole new twist It is not a cookie cutter plot it doesnt have a theme you have found in another movie it is just flat out unique and amazing No wonder it took Nolan  years to release it The acting in this film is just flat out outstanding After watching Cillian Murphy in The Dark Knight and Batman Begins it was hard to picture him acting in any other type of role But this film just pushed the bar up a few more levels He does an exceptional job with this film Dont even get me started with DiCaprios performance You can just expect that to be great and let me tell you IT ISNolan choice to pick actors from the Batman Series Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy was a risky one Its hard to picture these actors in another type of role after watching the Batman Series especially the number of times I have rewatched them But nonetheless High Risk  High Reward and without a doubt is this one a high rewardThis movie will literally Blow you away Its worth every penny I watched the movie in D and it was great Take your family Thats what I did Everyone Loved it It will be a great experience and if you dont decide to go see it yourself I bet someone eventually will make youOh and trust me youll have a hard time falling asleep and dreaming in the movie theater with this film ,Positive
Many people may think why to write the th review of the same film Well because something is needed to be pointed out Inception is NOT Paprika Ive seen both films recently Inception just yesterday and its plot is completely different Yes they share the aspect that one person can enter someone elses dream Paprikas spoiler and even shared dreams to an extent but the development the goals of the characters the scenarios not just the look but its use and the plot are completely different Were facing two films with their respective strengths and weaknesses I think theres so few left to speak about Inception but to say that everything on it was carefully designed and filmed Its definitely the work of a genius that will stand a top with others SciFi genre classics Keep up the great work Mr Nolan Youre from now my favorite director,Positive
Read the films ranked below Inception in the top and weep Have people lost their critical faculties Yes Inception is clever multilayered complex and intellectually challenging It is also heartless It struggles to stimulate emotion Cleverness replaces impact Di Caprios onedimensional acting reinforces this sterility From the first shot of a grim face we get the whole range of grim faces in a grim performance He is grim about his kids grim about the folding graphics grim about his team grim about the task in hand Of the Matrix plus effect I did like the folding city but the ending was portentous to the point of tedium One very good litmus test of the quality of a film is to analyse how many times the main protagonists have to explain the plot and at what length they have to explain it Several characters explain the rules of the dream within a dream within a dream construct at the heart of the movie with increasing loquaciousness and qualifications This isnt plotting and it fails to create a genuine narrative drive Compare it to so many of the films that come below this one in the rankings Twelve Angry Men Seven Samurai Goodfellas Casablanca Once upon a time in America Citizen Kane for goodness sake Dont even mention films like Shawshank and the Godfather which rank above it This is a good film possibly one of the better films of the year It is a very long way from a great one,Positive
Very very overrated film Worth seeing in the cinema for the visual effects but would never buy the DVD The acting is good but the content lacks a truly engaging story line It lures you in but never manages to hook you They shouldve explored other characters rather than Cobb It seems to me as though the film couldve been pulled off with a less talented supporting cast Also it is slightly confusing in some parts Other parts are way too predictable This is NOT the MIND BLOWING film people talk it up to be Those people out there who say this is a GREAT film are mistaken Although in saying that it stills scores a solid  Cam,Positive
Inception is an amazing movie that must be seen to enjoy the Summer blockbusters The fact is that this movie is probably the if not tied for the best movie that I have ever seen The movie is amazing and should be seen regardless of the liking of which forte for Inception covers them all and covers them so well that you cant help but have chills from the awesomeness of the movie even well after the movie was over The acting was fantastic Leos best performance and the writing and directing from the master Christopher Nolan was amazing Inception is a must see to and deserves at LEAST  Academy Awards but this might be the film that can get to  with Best Picture Best Director Best Actor Best Supporting Actor Best Supporting Actress Best Original Screenplay Best Makeup Best Visual Effects Best Cinematography Best Score Best Sound Editing and Best Editing My predictions Instant Classic high grossing and well accepted by every movie lover in America,Positive
This film surpassed every expectation I had when I walked into the theatre Not only was the acting brilliant the story superb and just the overall concept and execution flawless but I left the theatre completely mind blown I left in a state of wonder a state that I have yet to come out of even though it has been  hours since seeing itInception has caused me to ponder the nature of dreams and reality made me just sit down and think something so many films nowadays do not do I am  and I am disappointed at how so many films do not strive to be anything special now The main aim is to pull in as much money in the box office as possible James Cameron is even rereleasing Titanic in D and I am dying to know why What is the need More money However Nolans Inception was simply exquisite in every possible way It contained romance comedy suspense fantasy reality and anything else you could ask for There are going to be the reviewers that say this movie was too confusing or that it was nowhere near as good as everyone is making it out to be but I implore each and every one of you to go see this movie and make the decision for yourself This is a film that more films need to strive to be like Far too many of the films that have come out in the past ten years are lacking in one aspect or another but Inception is truly a masterpiece,Positive
i saw this movie yesterdayit was mind blowingi went with some great expectations and this movie surpassed my expectationsthe screenplay was awesome and the cast was excellentsome brilliant performances by actors like Dicapriolevitt and Ellen page had made this movie a  Oscar contenderthe first half of the movie was a bit slow but the second half gained pace and was mind blowingNolan deserves Oscar for creating this masterpieceam sure that this movie will be the no contender for  Oscarshope this movie gets many Oscars thanks to Nolan for giving this wonderful movie i give this movie a nolan u rock,Positive
Having seen the trailers for the past several weeks I was planning to see it but I was certainly not excited about it The next   hours flew by with a movie that entertained like a big budget movie and challenged the mind like a small indie flick As I tried to figure out exactly what happened which of course will be my opinion since this is the kind of movie that will be open to hundreds of interpretations I realized I needed to give it another look so I went back the next day and watched it again I noticed a few slight flaws the second time through but these were small details that can be rationalized depending on your point of view as to what the movie really was about Is this a all a dream Is it real and everything went as planned Are portions real and the end a dream There will be countless debate on this and we know Mr Nolan will never tell What I do know after this and the sensational Dark Knight I am now in the Christopher Nolan is far and away the most creative person in the film industry camp I strongly recommend to everyone  go see this and form your own conclusions  this movie does not preach but just entertains and challenges The best movie in years  nothing has been close,Positive
I just came out of a movie theater I am very shocked by this movie Dark Knight was super incredible but it is amazing how a guy can produce another equally amazing master pieceStory acting directing are all rock solid Carrying such a complicated story can turn out to be a disaster but Christoper Nolan has a perfect control over the progress of storyHe plays the audiences mind in a high level and never fails to lose the composure and intensity of the story through the entire running time To that such an intense and emotional story he also inserted appropriate amt of humor to provide some relaxationsAll the CG is wisely used and provides jaw dropping experiencesActing wise Leonardo Diccaprio does what he does basically providing his overall great acting All the others are also superbly casted Especially the guy from  Summer is better than I expected He looks serious enough and does provide some funny momentsAgain I am very impressed with what Christoper Nolan pulled off In my opinion he is actually becoming one of those legendary directors such as Hitchcock Nolan got famous for stories dealing Humans psychology This is another those stories but in a gigantic scaleUsually many directors fail to produce good movies with a lot of money but this Christopher Nolan has no limitations he did that in Dark Knight and also in this movie InceptionI look forward to seeing his next possibly masterpiece film,Positive
The special effects were great but the science was so flawed in this movie that it was incredible The storyline made absolutely no sense at all It also appears to be a bad ripoff of the Matrix can you say the Architect Even more illogical is the fact that if the Architect can create stairs doors or even an entire dream environment at will why cant they fly destroy anything they want any way they want or make themselves invisible At least in the Matrix Neo could flyThe movie just contradicts all of its own rules People were falling all over the place throughout different dream states but no one woke up even though a sense of falling wakes you up Even worse was the supposed technology used to put everyone in the same dream I dont even want to get started with that one but a pair of earbuds just will not do it I really think we need to stress science a little more in our schoolsIt was pretty cool looking though,Positive
Wow Its not often that I walk out of a cinema after seeing a movie and feel the need to pinch myself This film is so clever that I truly thought that it was out of human capability to come up with a story line so complex but yet fits so perfectly togetherWhen reading a description of this film in the cinema magazine that you pick up before you go in Im not going to lie I was terrified Having already ordered my tickets and being unable to change my mind the words Hold on to your heads for a real brain bender put me off instantly This description of the film made me expect something along the lines of The butterfly effect or Donnie Darko neither of which I fully got my head around and mainly watched for the hunky male leadsHowever I couldnt be more wrong about this masterpiece of a film I cannot really summarise in words how much it will make your jaw drop continuously throughout and highly recommend that you see thisIn conclusion  Phenomenal performances from everyone on screen  Fantastic music  Fantastic settings  Pure genius of a story line  Flawless Do not miss out on this fasten your seatbelts to be truly blown away,Positive
When I thought Nolan could not outshine himself I watch Inception This is not only a masterpiece of filmmaking but a journey to a place you dont want to leave One hour after watching it I am not able to fully describe what Ive seen heard and felt Its absolutely essential for your life to watch this movie Once you watch it you will experience pure genius from an author when trying perfection and joy when you feel he made it The cast action music effects plot and subtext are combined in a way most directors only can dream of Nolan has proved once again that quality intelligence and talent can also work in mainstream industry From this moment on most films will be boring simple and not worth watching That only happens when you reach pure happiness Thank you Mr Nolan culture and cinema are richer because of you and so are our lives If this man does not get an Oscar award the world is definitely doomed to ignorance and therefore to an end,Positive
OK here goes Ill prepare myself for an ass kickingI finish watching this film thinking are you guys really watching the same film as me Does this film really deserve  out of  st sept I found this film incredibly frustrating So I guess at the start you learn what a cool concept the film is based on Nice idea Very interesting So why take over hrs to get to the point I fell asleep twice whilst watching it and still managed to catch the end  not feeling that id missed anything importantI didnt really like the characters In these films you tend to connect with as least ONE character but I didnt feel it here at allSo some of you like the FX Yeah that ONE scene they used in the trailer The one they sold the film onOh yeah The last ranti cant stand films where they introduce rules and details that only apply in the next few scenes It so annoying and predictable They do that a lot in this filmSo anyway I left asking myself and the other people I saw this with why this film is so overrated and there are a lack of bad reviews about it We concluded its one of these trendy films that are meant to be clever and intelligent I think people will be afraid of saying bad points about this just in case it suggests that they dont understand the concept I for one did understand it I just didnt like it I certainly dont think it deserves  out of My suggestionjust go and rent Matrix or Minority Report or something like that Clever visually brilliant AND enjoyable,Positive
Inception is a work of bold ambition It is Nolans true masterpiece and one of the most original pieces of fiction ever put on film The story although multilayered and complex is incredibly engrossing and a wonder to behold on screen The movie follows Dom CobbDiCaprio as he leads a specialized team tasked with putting an idea inside the mind of Robert Fischer JrCillian Murphy This task is called Inception Cobb specializes in the Extraction of ideas from peoples minds in their dreams but Inception is an entirely different story Removing an idea from a persons mind proves easier because the person has already thought it but adding an idea is something that cant be done without carefully manipulating the mind to create the idea on its own This is the premise of Inception and thats only the surface There are so many layers to the plot that its almost impossible to divulge even a fraction of the story in any less than a few pages The script which took ten years to write is pure brilliance As the film progresses it only becomes more intriguing even up to the very end The acting is superb across the board The standout being DiCaprio but the entire cast delivers amazing performances Inception is visually dazzling and unlike anything ive ever seen on film But even the amazing visuals dont detract from the depth and complexities of the plot With amazing cinematography and a remarkably wellcrafted and fitting original score from Hans Zimmer there isnt an area where the film doesnt shine This is truly Nolans best and that is definitely saying something,Positive
The plot is like a Japanese anime named Paprika  So what I dont care Who watch anime anyway  Whats really great about this movie is that  its mass appealing  its visually beautiful and its one of only a few blockbusters especially scifi movies that will stay into your mind for a whileIts a smart movie and the plot is not overcomplicatedThe cast did a great acting job I really love Leo Michael Caine and Cilian Murphys performanceMy review doesnt need to be too long Just go see itI think this is going to become an instant classicCant wait for the next Nolan movie,Positive
Its been a couple of hours since I watched this new movie by Christopher Nolan After watching MementoBatman Begins and Dark Knight I was quite confident that this would be a memorable experience Also the expectations were rising high and I knew that it got good reviews still I was able to shut myself from all of them and see the movie freshI would rather say that I was blown away with the plot Its something one has never imagined of The whole movie was so exciting and blinkandyouwillmiss type that you will have to see it again or rethink it again and again to grasp the total plot just like Memento I was always fond of Nolans movie background sounds as it keeps you at the edge of your seatNow comes the acting part Caprio was excellent well accompanied by Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen Page and others But I would rather say that the actors didnt got much chance to do anything They did exactly what the script demandedThe direction was top notch along with the breathtaking visuals and locations Especially the dream scenes As for the academy awards I expect this film to grab the prize in directionscreenplaysound mixingsound editing and visual effects and may also the best picturenot quite sure after watching Toy Story  few weeks backAnyway for the people who are reading this review before going to see it I would advise that this would blow your mind A must see in my opinion because very few movies have a captivating plot and superb direction like this one Its an epic go for it,Positive
I felt like Im wasting my time with this movie really All of its plot is based on very simple idea yet this simple idea fails to convince me that its somehow possible in real world or necessary for heroes to accomplish or this movie is supposed to teach me something or relay the message Come on I was on the edge of my seat when I was watching The Matrix going WOW several times and I was never disappointed and what a simple yet powerful message this was With Inception I felt like watching The Prison Break series episode  The movie provides absolutely no answers why I should bother to worry if they deliver the thought to the poor sobs head which they drugged on the plane I simply dont care if they succeed or not No immersion In general words special effects were good streetbridge bending animations were good yet I was bored the whole time  out of  for this pointless flick which I forget in few weeks,Positive
All that hype for a movie which took several concepts which were already turned into movies and combined into a new one with different actors Dark City Matrix Time Machine ring any bells And left some serious loose ends in the story line And gave up some of the ending far too earlyMaybe I have seen too many movies On a bright note tho the actors fit nicely together and made it watchableEven for me ,Positive
wow  this movie s simply awesome how the hell did NOLAN think about this conceptDREAMSDREAMS the idea of planting an idea is stupendous Screenplay has good pace enough to grip youI think d editor would have put his every bit of effort to create dis moviecause showing dreams inside dreams inside dreams is a really difficult thingLeonardo scores well with his actingEllenCortillardJosephall of them have contributed well to the movie  and our SCARECROWCILLIAN MURPHYhas an important role unlike BATMAN BEGINS or THE DARK KNIGHTHe has worked in his character overall an s Oscar Waiting Congrats NOLAN  you are one of the best in the Hollywood  just getting BETTER and BETTER ,Positive
This movie is a beauty It has stayed permanently in my top  movies of all time since it was released Ive rewatched it countless times The acting storyline and visuals are A,Positive
Inception is the th film from Christopher Nolan and grapples with concept of dreams and the power of the human mind It is a spectacle of visual engineering and sound design while maintaining a deep and full bodied story The emotional aspect dreams and reality will stick with you long after you have finished watching It is no wonder that Nolan spent  years writing Inception,Positive
I was waiting for this movies to release  did not get the chance to see it on the first day  got the tickets on the second day  going in to the theater my expectation were high and i have to say that Nolans did not disappoint me at all in fact Christopher Nolan and Leonardo Di Caprio has shown there class  All the side characters in the movie played there parts well  every actor suits the character they are playing u cant judge the coming scene and many times it will surprise you according to me this is the best movie of the year  Nolan n Leonardo has shown there class in there respective field  everything about this movie is refreshing and amazing The plot of the movie is planted well enough to keep u at your seats,Positive
This movie came out on my birthday July   so I went to see as a present from my parents I had high expectations seeing as how Chris Nolan is one of my favorite Directors and Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors I was blown away by the acting directing plot and special effects of this film This movie easily replaced The Departed as my favorite film of all time This movie is just so perfect I was on the edge of my seat the whole time in the Theater I was thinking about this movie the whole night after I got home from the theater so I just decided to write a review about it to tell everyone to go see it I am true to my word when I say that this movie is unbelievable and it is a must see This film has many Oscars coming its way,Positive
I found this film to be neither the greatest scifi or not film ever nor did it suck the way some recent commentators seem to think I did think it was quite good Leonardo DiCaprio has finally grown up and is an outstanding actor Ellen Page was very good as well I had never heard of her until she was recently in some TV commercials in the US which told me that lots of other people know who she is For a pretty young actress her role was  asexual In only one very brief scene would it have mattered if the role was played by a manBut the best thing about Inception was its originality It was not a sequel remake remade TV show or remade comic book which is all that Hollywood seems to churn out these daysAs for its complexity I was able to follow quite well certainly well enough to enjoy it The few points Id missed I read in the FAQ section here and frankly Im not sure I would have gotten them on a second viewing aloneI understand why many folks are miffed by its high alltime ranking Yall just have to understand that so many voters are young people who have not seen or do not like classic cinema so recent films will always be overstated It will be interesting to see what Inceptions rating will be twenty years from nowI recommend checking it out,Positive
This is not my kind of movie If I want to speculate on what is really happening Ill read a mystery novel something I almost never do anymore I dont enjoy a movie that forces me to try and figure out the plot Not that it should be totally obvious from the beginning but this was just too much head work for me and I could tell that it was a puzzler early onI go to the movies for entertainment  not to solve puzzles After  minutes I walked out I was not entertained and I knew I wouldnt be After seeing thousands of movies I can usually tell quickly if Im going to like itBut thats just me I can see how others thought this movie was great but you must remember that its not for everyone Im not a fan of Matrix or Tron either so you can see why Im not interested SciFi and puzzles are fun for some not for me anymore,Positive
I just recently saw this film and to say the least I am impressed Christopher Nolan has done what many people cant seem to do these days which is to come up with an original idea and make it a great film If you can make it through a movie while being slightly confused this is a movie for you It is full of action science fiction and mind boggling storyline It is a great film and a must see Leonardo De Caprio rocked his performance along with Jason Gordon Levitt and Ellen page This movie also has humor in it which is unexpected but put in very good timing Christopher Nolan has outdone himself and makes The Dark Knight look amateurish So get in line buy the ticket and watch this movie as many times as you can IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT,Positive
This is the work of a true maestro I have never seen anything like this its art in its purest form This movie is beyond unique Christopher Nolans mastery of filmmaking is second to none He is literally one of the best filmmakers the best imo of all time without a doubt and he proved it with The Dark Knight in  and cemented it with Inception in  Both of them are counted among the greatest movies ever createdInception is the most innovative and incredible scifi showcase in the history of cinema I cannot even imagine the thought process that went into creating such a concept which is so incredibly complex Nolan perfectly crafted a world of his own which is so mesmerizing that it feels completely real Everything about this movie acting writing direction background score and character development is bloody top notchIf you watched Inception in an IMAX theater youre one of the lucky ones Long story short you cant skip this movie and say that you love cinema Inception is an experience one that you cant afford to miss,Positive
Inception has a very special place in my heart Since I watched it the first time I have returned to it on several occasions throughout the years and every time I get transported right back to the same trance I was in the first time Because it isnt often you watch a movie that leaves you with a feeling of completion to such a degree as this movieIts a hour and minute masterpiece containing one of the best and most iconic movie scores everIts a hour and minute triumph in visual effectsAnd Its a  hour and minute long showcase of why Christopher Nolan might just be the most unique refined and important director of the st century so farAfter careful consideration Ive concluded that there is not a single aspect of this movie that isnt straightout worldclassDare I say film perfection,Positive
"You musnt be afraid to dream a little bigger darling  Eames
These words best sum up this outstanding filmNNolan is one of the few who takes movies to the next level It had been a while since I had seen this film but once again I found myself watching this masterpiece with goosebumps I have no idea how nolan manages to pull this off every time Every movie he develops is doomed to be a successOf course lets not forget the amazing soundtracks by our friend  Hans Zimmer  one of the best composers the film industry will ever knowThank you to all the actors directors producers composers crewmembers for creating a film that will stay with us all our lives",Positive
Visually interesting and innovative yet pretentious It has an excellent cast with great performances The complexity of its story works perfectly in the way of confusing us Its easy to think that something that we dont fully understand is great Its easy to see how so many people liked the film so much There are plenty of alleged subtleties and symbols which the fans are so eager to comment Everyone can write a script that is complex It only needs not be completely logicI prefer a narrative that is simple but at the same time thick This is harder to doFar from being a masterpiece extremely overrated,Positive
I tried not to let the preposterous build up and hype for this movie influence me before I watched it Im glad that I did that because my expectations really werent that high As a result I enjoyed this film quite a bit Im not sure about its rewatchability but it certainly keeps you interested throughout Its captivating on two fronts One the story itself and two the fear that theres something else going on and that the other shoe could drop at any minute Nolan plays it masterfully There were shortcomings for me however Minor inconsistencies falling kicks were happening every five seconds and shifting between dream world and movie world time frames made it awkward at times Also the action sequences featured that poor shaky cam quality that Ive really come to loathe There was even some poor use of the steady cam on regular shots Minor quibbles aside I loved the theme they tackled and the trippy nature of the film itself Anyone that has lost someone close to them knows the frustration of trying to keep a firm memory and those little nuances of them alive For me the bizarre concept and why they can even do what they do is secondary What carries the film are great performances mixed with an emotional impact mixed with its unique plot angle While not THE greatest thing ever put to film as some may suggest it certain was an entertaining film to say the least,Positive
"Im embarrassed to say that I only just watched inception for the first time last week seeing as I have watched so many movies of all genres In my  years but Im glad I waited until seventeen to watch it because if I was younger I dont think I would have appreciated how amazing this film is Since I watched it a week ago not because I didnt get it the first time but because I could not believe how much I enjoyed it But I have seen a lot of people rate this film low because they didnt get it which is unfair because it doesnt mean its bad it just means it isnt pandering to everyone like most films do which results in them having dull plots
Some of the reasons this film is great include the acting the acting in this film is on point that includes all characters from cobb to Fischer there were no let downs Next the music Hans zimmer had once again created the perfect score which really captures the tone and the feel of the movie The music makes the action more exciting and brings a lot more passion to the more emotional scenes
Lastly the plot and script are intricately written giving us enough time with all characters will moving along the story The story is one that you will only come across every now and then a story which isnt obvious or overused This is original and amazing I recommend watching to everyone",Positive
Great mind bending movie you cannot imagine second secne in this film and cannot imagine ending,Positive
I am stingy when it comes to awarding  points for a movie but in this case I have no choice Have seen quite a bit of movies over the last  years but none of them ever incited me to discuss it with my friends or even if they did not the way inception is doing nowPeople rave about avatar but other than the fancy graphics the storyline was very bland None of thats going to happen with inception From the start right till the end it will keep you wondering as to what might come next Makes you think as well You dont have to be super smart to understand the movie An average person will surely absorb it pretty decentlyLeo has been amazing as always Hes a brilliant actor probably the best currently Nolan and leo both deserve Oscars for what they have achieved here Levitt has been damn good The last I saw of him was in  days of summer Was pleasantly surprised to see him in a mature role Not sure about Ellen Page Nothing in her role made me say wow shes damn good She was okay Ken Watanabe was decent Tom Hardy was good I liked the way he portrayed being a more seriousjovial kind of person as opposed to how Levitt is especially allI am damn happy for watching the firstdayfirstshow for this movie Planning to go down and watch it again tomorrow Worth every extra penny i am spending on it ,Positive
Inception Is a masterpieceThe cast is perfect with Leonardo DiCaprio and actors like Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen Page who were amazingThe visual effects are outstanding The score composed by Hans Zimmer is perfect and syncs with the movieOverall this may be the best movie of Summer  This movie is a  Terms of film excellence,Positive
Ive watch this movie about  times and still you see details you didnt see beforeI was young when this movie came out  years old and watched It when I was  It is just a masterpieceThe writting is perfect the acting is perfect the screenplay is perfect the set is perfect one of the best cast there is Leonardo Dicaprio never disappoints The sensation of the film is there you feel like youre also in a dream Lets not forget Hans Zimmer who is in my opinion the best film composer there is the music is epic and works perfectly with the movie Absolutely incredible It is now  and a week ago Ive watched Oppenheimer and Lets just say that Christopher Nolan is in my opinion the best if the best you dont have to agreeBest film Ive ever saw Everything is just perfect,Positive
I literally didnt even know what was going on half the time its like a dream in a dream in a dream in a dream in a dream lol,Positive
This splendidly visual film is not the nd coming nor will it best The Dark Knight at the box office On positive notes what this movie is is a splendidlyphotographed very wellscored strongly productiondesignedset decorated drama with straightforward acting that improves no brings out no lifts up the overlong screenplay Ellen Page deserves a supporting Oscar nom On negative notes some critics complain of too much exposition and several implausible scenarios Since Inception is all a dream within a dream within the implausible scenarios become plausible because theyre happening within dreams My complaint is that there is way too much studiomandated explosions gunfire and car chases Nolan may never be able to make another Insomnia or Memento in his career Hes the official Warner Brothers if not industry stalwart director The man with the Midas touch and the costprice of that moneymaking achievement is all the unnecessary studiomandated explosions gunfire and car chases that bloat InceptionOne last note Inception employs a cliffhanger possibly to ensure material for Warner Brothers sequel films that lacks resolution creating an anticlimax to a story in which the audience has invested  hours and twenty minutes,Positive
Incredible movie  Weve seen it  times now and are still learning new things Does anyone think that all of Cobbs team infiltrated HIS dreams and that all of this like Michael Douglas in the Game is only for Cobbs sake that the Ken W is only a player in the dream and that his desire to take over the power company was planted the same way they were planting things in Killian Murphys dream  and that even the Killian Murphy subplot was also a plant in Cobbs head Cant wait till this comes out on DVD so that we can study it further Thought the snow mountain scene went on too long but was still way cool The spinning top in the end toppling reveals its not a dream  at least thats how we interpreted it But whens the last time you saw a movie you then discussed for days afterward,Positive
Inception is a terrific mix of think and thoughtChristopher Nolan has made story paramount and beefed up as many action scenes as possible Somewhat neglected in that mix is the role of characterIf you loved The Matrix than this is for you in spadesBy using dream within a dream story lines we see the same people doing different things at the same time Its not all that challenging to keep track of four or five levels at a time especially if you accept the premise that time flows more rapidly the deeper you getFive minutes in real time is an hour on level one and the bottom level can consume a lifetimeFor me the fabulous sets and the intricacies of the dream structure had me riveted to the action But I did long for some character development a nuance that wasnt related to that persons dream storyThe choice of Ellen Page is particularly questionable She doesnt seem to have the depth of expression of even an ordinary actor and as one of only two women featured should be betterBut there are some fabulous effects Roped bodies moved as a weightless pile through corridors and elevators A falling bus on the second level that takes forever to hit the water into which it eventually plungesThe planting of seeds isnt some new concept The next time you thirst for a drink youve never tasted think advertising and youve come up with your own seedIf you ask why such a good rating with so many detractions well its really an andahalf and it is damn good at what it does,Positive
I tried to watch this in a theater when it came out and fell asleep I finally got thru it many years later Idk I loved Interstellar thought it was fantastic but this was super boring I should have liked it I just didnt and I cant explain why Seems like the writers and such just tried to hard,Positive
There was a Film Named M german it was not just an ordinary film it made such an impact on people Mind tat they never forgot the movie in their entire life time  those were the times when there was no IMDb or boxoffice or  min movie updates  yet still the reviews for the movie said   It will take at least  years for good films like this  come   to everyones surprise it took  years for such an masterpiece in Film making  such story  such screenplay  what am trying  say is  M  was in   In  Its Inception  This Epic Film will test your intelligence  your way of imagining things   every minute detail in this film is so awesome  that you will keep on thinking about this one atleast for two days  every Christopher Nolan has an impact one you  trust me this one will change everything Dont watch this movie in Ur laptop or ipad or anything  its worth every penny you spend on this one  A complete Film  i dont wanna a write a  page review on this one  Go Live The Dream In Theaters D,Positive
Christopher Jonathan James Nolan has made some brilliant movies in his not so long directorial life Inception is just an addition to his quiver of mind blowing films It is so good to watch a film like Inception which strives and manages to dream big without giving up on the cerebral portion of film makingInception has a plot that is best left unexplained and untainted but I do have to admit it is one of Chris Nolans most non complicated movies I still think his best was in Following and Memento This film is brilliant but somehow you have a feeling that he is holding back not pulling all punches It seems almost tailored for the Iron Man and Transformers audience I can understand it not being too vague but I do feel that Inception has been over simplified thus losing a bit of its shine in the process But trust me it is still going to be the most engrossing big movie of the year and it is an awesome watch Its just that it does not challenge the viewer as much as some of Nolans previous movies did and that is something I missed during watching this film But then i guess its understandable with a budget of  milOn the acting front brilliant performances from everyone and its a delight to see Michael Kane in a two bit role Leo DiCaprio reprises a role similar to his role in the recent Shutter Island and is just as good Marion Cotillard is shimmering and sensuous as Leos wifeOverall a great intriguing movie to watch but still does not overwhelm Nolans best films which continue to be his initial movies,Positive
Ive seen this movie twice yet im still thrilled about it Chris Nolan IS the best director in the world even before he made this movie and with Inception hes just wanna remind everyone that hes still the best even though The Dark Knight released almost  years agoLeos acting is probably the best one he has done so far and the most surprising is that Joseph Gordon Levitt Tom Hardy and Ellen Page somehow almost stole Leos spotlightRight now im still amazed of how Chris Nolan get the idea for this movie And the tagline Your Mind Is The Scene Of The Crime is also one of the best tagline everI wouldnt be surprised if Inception gets the best movie award in the Academy Awards next year along with Chris Nolan Hans Zimmer Leo DiCaprio and Ellen Page,Positive
It is one of the best movies Oh yeah then I remind myself of The Dark Knight I chose to give Inception   because giving it  will be equating it with The Dark KnightNolans movies arent for those with low concentration power You need to be in the movie in order to keep pace with story It is almost like studying for an exam And this one is the toughest of them allThe best thing apart from good acting from all those involved is great script It does not give you any chance to sit back and relax You are pulled inside the movie The pace at which the movie goes is enjoyable to watchThe important fact about this movie is that there is no stand out character like the Joker Each character has been given equal importance and as a whole have done a splendid jobChristopher Nolan has taken great risk in making this movie He is banking upon the audiences to be intelligent enough to enjoy the movie You might hear reviews from friends saying that the movie is crap I heard it myself but let me tell you that it is a must watch If you are the kind of movie buff who likes to see movie as an art and not just for actors and actions and other secondary thingsIf you are going to watch this movie make sure you go when you have nothing on your mind because you will need to focus on the movie,Positive
Great presentation but in the end nothing comes out Tom Hardy and Leonardi DiCabrio as always good But all in all its one of the worse Nolan movies The end of the movie however is good the spin that maybe turns or not is a very nice idea The film is confused bichts is explained to one I like Christopher Nolen Especially The Dark Knight but this film is mercilessly against him,Positive
Not the very beginning but about  minutes or so into the movie I didnt know what to think I felt like a lot was left out and I was going to be pretty confused But it picked up very fast and got to the main part making the rest of the movie pretty much perfect in my eyes The excitement was just too intense at parts The suspense had me at the edge of my seat at times wondering what I was going to see next The ending was one of the best parts Watch and you will see The writers really had something going here The ability to control yours and others dreams To bring a team into someones mind and help control their dream The ability to make a dream within a dream This really was written by great minds and Nolan really directed it well The movie is just shy of  and a half hours but it doesnt really seem like it because you will enjoy this film The cast was excellent Leonardo DiCaprio was great Ellen Page was also a great second Cillian Murphy stayed more quiet but still could act My medal of great acting has to go to Joseph GordonLevitt Never thought I would see him in such a fighting type role but it really fit for him Unfortunately Tom Berenger gets the award for not acting as well I think he is just getting too old maybe This movie has some great action shots and the CG is pretty good too Pure suspense from start to finish Great film great cast great writing,Positive
Inception is what you get when a filmmaker knows how to merge style with substance Christopher Nolan has crafted a story not an original one but thats OK that takes slightly abstract ideas and places it in a reality you can almost grasp and then tells it with little complexity Its a movie for all the masses  and thats where Nolans genius comes inHe gives us characters many of them in fact and all performed expertly by the stellar cast The dreams all have their own architecture which is visually stunning And no its not redundant to say again that he managed to merge style with substanceInception is filled with special effects action running all over the place and loud dramatic scores Remember this is Nolan with a big budget But its also just a straightforward story with characters and romance  it does star Leonardo DiCaprio after all,Positive
Christopher Nolan you never disappoint me With the dark knight and now this How does this guy do this Well first off inception takes you where no other film ever has One of the most original screenplays today The plot is simple the movie itself is so complex It is filled with action suspense and takes you a huge variety of places Usually in a movie theres a Climax or final showdown Where there is one thing or job left to do Those sequences usually last  minutes but here it take a good hour and a half This is a movie that will leave you thinking and talking Describing this movie is truly difficult because words cannot describe this masterpiece This is a must see movie and honestly one of the best movies that Ive seen to this day Inception sure as hell delivers,Positive
Visually the cinematography was excellent The story was weak and I am shocked how many people are giving this  stars  people I worked with saw this and only  liked it This is two weird movies in a row made by Leonardo DiCaprioI feel like Nolan is just revamping parts of Memento Batman Dark Knight etc to his movies The ending credits are the same for every movie He put in a fortress in the snow like the fortress in the beginning of Batman Returns And what about that snow Its like he just wanted to say lets film in the snow He is actually stealing a lot of this from other movies and getting the credit for this being an original movie This movie is Oceans Eleven meets The Island I was very disappointed,Positive
its THAT good i actually bothered to review a film for the first time The concept is just fantastic so original The actors are brilliant the special effects are spectacularly mind bending The whole thing is a perfectly balanced roller coaster ride twisting and turning but not confusing action packed but not a gore show fast paced and yet containing enough philosophical themes to keep you talking and thinking for a long time I can safely say this is the best film Ive seen all yearGo and see it while its in the cinema Im pretty sure  of people who watch it will love it,Positive
This movie starts off really interesting but fails to go any deeper than lots of standard Hollywood crap like a really forced back story for the main character Characters lack depth and the most interesting part of the movie is its visual effects which are nowhere short of amazing Avatar level production However in a few couple of years these CGI effects will not be that impressive anymore and then people will hopefully see how lacking this movie is for a good story and characters The average moviegoer will love this movie but if you like good movies in the scifi genre you kind of expect at least some plot twists Still the movie is good and well made but not great It will most probably be forgotten in a couple of yearsIf you enjoy movies with action and CGI and want a movie to watch with friends go see this movie If you are looking for something truly originalstorywise then avoid this movie at all costs,Positive
I saw the trailer and thought looks quite interesting Then the hype started and I read all the glowing reviews from critics but what the hell do they know Popped to see the film with high expectations cause Chris Nolan has always been on the money Well I could try to explain but wouldnt do it justice Even if I tried to give away the ending there are another  minutes of brilliance to see I cant recall a film had me so transfixed for every secondthrilling clever grand entertaining intelligent thoughtprovoking and utterly mindblowing The cast score the set pieces the paceenough said Whatever youve seen beforeAvatar the Matrixforget themthis is the new bar,Positive
Christopher Nolan is one of the few filmmakers in the world today with the ability to make a big budget blockbuster that is truly original Inception is like nothing you have ever seen before The plot involves a world where the technology exists to allow people to invade the dreams of others This technology has a practical use if you make your living stealing ideas like Leonardo DiCaprios character doesBeyond that I wont say anything about the plot because the less you know going in the better I will say that the story is nothing short of incredible I cant imagine the amount of work it took to write such a complex script and still have it all come together neatly with zero plot holes I have this image in my head of Nolan drawing these massive flow charts with a thousand bubbles on a giant dryerase boardThis film will please every kind of moviegoer from the averagejoe who likes action and special effects to the hard core film nerd that likes to analyze every second of screen time this movie works on enough levels to please them allNolan does require of his audience the ability to pay very close attention for the entire  hours but if you give him that hell take you on an incredible journey Inception is truly one of the best films ever made,Positive
First of all CN is without doubt the best director of our time because he is unmatched by any director in his styleatmosphere  tone and ending  he directs because that what he want  he dont want some Blockbuster that everybody will forget after they leave the cinema  he wants to put his signature and to be remembered for his artInception is a movie that only smart people will know what is going on  from the beginning to the end the whole movie for some reason felt like one big scene maybe because there was no holes in the plot perfect logic and mastermind director  min was like dream  really Nolan manged to make a movie that will make you live in dreamlike feeling for me at least  the acting  soundtrack  locations  atmosphere and the special effects are all PERFECT A masterpiece work of art  this is what you got when the writer direct the movie  and for those who feel a little bit lost it is like The Matrix but in the eyes of Christopher Nolanif something happened to CNolan say goodbye Hollywood ,Positive
First thing first Inception is the best English sciencefiction film ever no doubt Christopher Nolan creates a world of multi layered dreams that tests the audience at every step While watching the movie I felt that I was part of something really special Go for it guys Do yourself a favor watch Inception I am not going to describe the story here as that is for you to find out But will advise you that it is not a film where you go with friends or girlfriend to have a party You have to watch very closely to get the flavor Nolan has certainly peaked and wont ever make a better form of celluloid masterpiece For me it is no  And I am sure that most of my friends will agree to it The entire starcast is also a winner along with the trillion dollar script,Positive
The mindbending qualities of this film remind the viewer that your perception is everything Christopher Nolan has let this concept mature in his mind for nearly ten years Something so carefully crafted and matured deserves to be commended The films plots subplots and back stories may confuse the viewer at first but Nolan does everything he can to make this world as clear as the dreams within it The ensemble cast is the most solid I have seen since The Lord of the Ring Trilogy They are so convincing and so into their roles I felt so connected to the main characters portrayed by Leo DiCaprio and Ellen Page After the film was over the audience got up and left We all strangers began discussing the film and figuring out what it all meant My words to a potential viewer do not think you are intellectually below this movie You will get it and what you dont is impossible to understand Even Christopher Nolan could not tell you what it all means My final thought I am reluctant to pay to see movies especially at nonmatine price I jumped right on this film and it was entirely worth it Favorite Film of the Summer Stars Two Thumbs Up Hey Mikey He Likes It,Positive
This film has been seriously hyped  like many other viewers I expected much more than it delivered Almost everyone has had that experience of being disappointed by a film that you have been really looking forward to  this was a prime example First of all the acting  Keanu Reeves and Joseph GordonLevitt  separated at birth and neither can act at all I liked Ellen Page very much in Juno but she was sadly miscast in this role Not that any actress could have made sense out of her character  she was at random times a newbie who needed the basics explained andor an authority on how the whole thing worked The plot was filled with these messy holes but it wasnt entirely negative  some of the effects were fun and DiCaprio is always good as was most of his supporting cast On the whole worth seeing just dont expect it to be the best film you ever saw,Positive
This movie is so hard to describe because the idea of this movie is something you have to see for yourself I just got done watching this film  minutes ago and was I ever so shocked The most I can share with whoever reads this review is that the majority of the audience shared a twist that was beyond Shutter Island Christopher Nolan delivers a grand scale complicated but satisfying film with such emotional drive that it even had the attention of women who just want a quick fix film that will satiate And again I cannot stress enough how AWESOME this movie is This is a movie youll want to see as a midnight screening in IMAX Whats even better is that it doesnt need the technology of D to deliver like Avatar No offense James Cameron AS SOON AS YOU READ THIS GET YOUR LITTLE BUTT OUT OF THAT CHAIR TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER OR IPAD OR WHATEVER AND GO WATCH INCEPTION,Positive
The relationship between movies and dreams has always been one of the cinema world key The dream has always been there in different forms and shapes Lots of movies around imagemaking power of the mind since decades before lots of material released to unleash fantasies of millions of people But this one will be a corner stone of this kind of movie and further Im not a Di Caprio fan at all but this time he did amazingly well The idea is not totally original Just to mention a title The Cell is another movie around the using of the mind to discover something But Inception has a different purpose most centered on the use of dreams to obtain the goal The pace of the movie is a continuous innuendo till the last second,Positive
Ive seen it twice so far Inception is a fabulous high quality heist movie in which nothing is taken instead an idea is implanted in the mind of a markMurphy but also the audience Its also a journey into the underworldand calls to mind the story of Orpheus and Eurydiceand his journey to rescue his wife from death Cobb may not be able to rescue his dead wife but his obsession with her leads him in the end to making a journey deep into an Underworld where she has become a more vindictive character Like Orpheus Cobb cant return Mal to the world of the living he can only let her go Also another nice twist is to have an Ariadne who makes mazes But She is also the thread that guides the audience thru the storyshe asks our questionsshe goes all the way to Limbo with Cobb and her last words to him are words of advice to rescue Saitoas if she is implanting an idea in his mind What a great cast of characters playing off one another who lighten the tense story Loved the scenes in the dreams when the van is in freefall or rolling down the slopeas if in a dream Quirks like after Yusuf has righted the van he turns to share the experience with the passengersonly then remembering they are asleep and Arthus playful kiss with Ariadne The most novel idea the projections acting like white blood cells against the invaders,Positive
All that stuff about sharing dreams makes zero scientific or philosophical sense And noone can have dreams with that amount of detail that many actors that much lightning fast action etc etc Read Daniel Dennett There were plenty of stunning special effects and stunts certainly but I had the feeling throughout that the plot was just a peg to hang these on If you want to see how to do dreams in cinema look elsewhere for example the dream sequence in Wild Strawberries the Soldiers dreams in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie the whole of Un Chien Andalou Even Buster Keaton did better than this in Sherlock Junior odd years agoIf youre going to make a film about dreaming first figure out how to film dreams,Positive
Look I am a fan of Chris Nolan or at least I used to be His movies are always different and I liked them Prestige was the first movie that I watched of him and I loved it The Dark Knight was the movie that I had the highest expectations and it did not let me down I know there are  things not to like The Dark Knight but for me there were  things to like But this time I AM disappointed Inception is like the cutest car that cant run very fast It has its good looking but no good plot and a million questions about the conceptThere are a few simple rules about a science fiction movie or story When you watch one there are things you feel right or not You can use your wildest imaginations but at some point they have to make sense This film certainly did not feel right This was like a low budget science fiction which starts well but loses it after a while except for this was a big budget movie Well there ARE a few things to like about this movie It has a good concept good graphics and good acting If the plat was better and a few more things made more sense this could have been the masterpiece everyone thinks it to be,Positive
"Its fascinating but a little bit boring
The idea was great and unique The actors does well  the futuristic emphasis on the dreams and the ability to jump into your subconscious mind was confusing and scary although its still not reality thank god I can say I had great time but I wont repeat it",Positive
This immediately became my favorite movie of all time the first time I watched it before Interstellar I even remember watching the trailers back when I used to watch trailers and openly stating that it looks like it could be my favorite movie ever I stupidly went into the movie with the highest expectations Ive ever had And it still completely blew me awayThe experience is phenomenal fascinating nerveracking and aweinspiring from beginning to end Elite directing elite acting elite cast elite concept elite story elite cinematography elite music HANS Elite everything This movie can be analyzed for hours It has so many layers figuratively and literally This movie blew my mind It explored something fascinating in all the right ways taken it in all the right directions viewings  ,Positive
"Inception is such a film which was like Beyond my imagination
Cristopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors of all time undoubtedly The way he presented the story in this films was really praiseworthy Actually he does this in every of his films
Also the actors did a great job",Positive
If you love Christopher Nolan films or films in general you will love Inception heck if you dont like films you still have to see this The acting was top of the barrel Leonardo The Apprentice The Japanese Billionaires and his friends were all incredible in this dream in a dream in a dream flick that will make you wonder and fascinate With gratuitous action and awesome adventure Inception truly is a sight to see that is why Inception is in my top  movies ever and after watching it I guarantee you will place it in your top  minimum Pay the money for the Blu Ray or watch it online Inception is worth your time,Positive
I love this movie in every single shot The music is perfect The acting is pretty good DiCaprio shouldve won an Oscar for this role,Positive
This film is overrated Besides being accompanied by a score determined to set you to sleep theres really no filmmaking here that sets it above the restThe plot is very interesting and for the most part well conceived However the characters do too much talking simply explaining to the audience what the meaning of their actions are Why assume the audience is ineptThe basis of the plot itself is where film most earns its grade This is truly a unique idea for the screen Unfortunately it was denigrated by the unnecessary dumbing down of the story and the unimpressive acting of the castNo matter what the subject of a movie to end it with the question of whether it was all a dream or not is not clever,Positive
Nolan delivers a true masterpiece This is easily one of the best movies of all time filled with mind bending sequences great writing and a visionary experience,Positive
IMDb perhaps you should increase your rating scale to  since the release of this movie A longtime Christopher Nolan fan I was expecting this film to be better than I could imagine It was Far betterKeeping this simple Inception may very well be the best movie I have ever seenSeeing it on the Big Screen was an intense experience and I hesitate recommending it to anyone who may become ill from intense action sequencesIf you are not one of these people and have not yet seen this movie then I pity you for not having seen it YET PS If you have never heard of Christopher Nolan please for the love of god search his name on this website and watch his other movies he has actually made more great films in addition to the one Heath Ledger died shortly after making PSS To those who say Inception is not an original idea DUH Saying Inception is a remake of Paprika is preposterous Do you really think that  was the first time anyone had an idea like this Its called execution,Positive
From the very starting of Inception one will be engrossed by the sheer intensity of the film The beauty lies in the aspect that it deals with such a common psychological state but still creates an awe Another aspect of Inception is that it binds the viewer with the journeyInception is a movie where we see the magnitude of a director Christopher Nolan can handle psychology better than any contemporary director but the way he handles the architecture of mind and the juxtaposition of scenes is somewhatmind boggling Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his most nuanced performances till date The rest of the cast is brilliant Comic moments created by Tom Hardy is refreshingInception is not a movie it is an experiencewatch it to just experience it After that watch it for a second time to bow to the genius of Christopher Nolan,Positive
I think this kind of movie comes once in a century,Positive
I must be like getting old and jaded or something I found the movie predictable and more straightforward than I hoped it would beA good alternative name for the film would have been Wait what as if there was any less action youd be constantly asking yourself why the eff they didnt do X or why Y didnt happen etc The word contrived will keep nudging at your brain if youre not doing an exceptional job of suspending all disbelief along with all common senseThe final scene of the film was rather obvious from early on I thoughtI found it relatively easy to follow exactly what I was expecting and totally lacking in interesting Sixth Sense plot twists Everything pretty much was as it was presented to beNot sure how this makes it to  on the alltime best listThe Matrix was way more entertainingG,Positive
To wake up from a dream requires a major impact but sometimes you cant tell if its in a dream so you have the totem of a top But how do you know that the reality you are experiencing is not a dream The condition of waking up is to leave the world Dream dream in dream dream and reality are intricate The movie is more complicated but you can understand it if you watch it several times Its worth watching,Positive
When i first heard about this movie i believed it was just another hyped up big budget movie i was completely wrong This movie is easily Nolans greatest work of art The acting and script for Inception is stunning For him to make this movie very complex yet easily understandable is simply brilliant From start to finish i was on the edge of my seat along with everyone else in the theater and was extremely pleased with the ending This was the first movie to leave me utterly speechless after leaving the theater This is definitely one movie you should see in theaters I cant imagine this movie not winning film of the year because it is undoubtedly one of the best films of all time,Positive
"Nolan at his best this is a masterpiece
 hours and a half full of cinematic perfection emotional cases touching quotes and a heartfelt music
I really watched it  times  with each time I repeat watching it I find out some great and new things ",Positive
"Damn this movie No matter how many times I watch it it always make me happy and I always cry with joy at the end
This is a movie which will be talked about for decades for even after century",Positive
I dont know how a concept as abstract as dreams can have a movie so amazing done on them but it was done as perfect as possible Fitting score light comedy great action this movie has it all The chemistry and acting is perfect The premise is explained so naturally and doesnt seemed forced to explain how things happened You do have to pay attention and not miss some details  in the end it is an unforgettable film that will be remembered as a classic,Positive
Awesome movie Action is fantastic Ending is one of the best Always entertaining,Positive
It is perfect in every wayThank you for reading my indepth reviewPeace,Positive
This movie is certainly unique Great castconcept and story line The best part is that the director explains his idea brilliantly rather than making it confusing and difficult for the viewers,Positive
I was expecting it to be overrated but i found this movie as good as hype,Positive
Blew my mind when I watched it and still blows my mind nowRidiculously clever and entertainingHalf the time you are just mesmerised on one hand I wish more movies could be like Inception on the other hand Im glad they arent so we can appreciate a stunner when it comes alongDont take my word for itwatch it,Positive
Inception is the smartest science fiction film and overall blockbuster in the last couple of decades that makes you wonder why Hollywood cant find similar genius as ambitious and passionate as Christopher Nolan whose vision is comparable to that of the great Stanley KubrickInception is a new genre of film and can go absolutely anywhere it wants to There are few refreshing experiences at the movies like watching an original screenplay come to life in such a manner as Chris Nolan does He mixes the film noir and science fiction genres seamlessly and the result is absolutely gorgeousInception is a breed of film which deserves every bit of praise earned thus far it knows that its viewers want to see a film that shows unforeseen aspects of the human psyche which Leonardo DiCaprio shows through his character Dom Cobb exceptionally well The film is an experience and so much more than the typical tentpole blockbuster coming out these daysInception is a fine piece of science fiction cinema that feels like a classic yet new film Watch this movie with open eyes and be prepared to witness what many acclaimed a masterpiece and get ready to be surprised,Positive
Im not going to even try to explain the story but Inception proves that a movie can be a successful action blockbuster a philosophical lesson and a story about grief and overcoming it all in one Inception is a brilliant movie and is Christopher Nolan at his best,Positive
I really liked this movie it is long but keeps you intrigued and interested What I didnt like and made me want to stop watching it is the score there is way too much of it too overwhelming that the characters dont have any personality all emotions are driven by the score and the orchestral backdrop really This is present in most Hollywood movies which is unfortunate,Positive
I cannot phrase it better so I will quote Rex Reed who called Inceptions storyline prattling drivel A friend claimed Inception is a thinking persons movie but a thinking person will realize that it is only masquerading as a thinking persons movie At bottom intellectually there is no there there Add to this that someone clearly believed the film needed to be pumped up with overwrought drama to qualify it as a summer blockbuster I couldnt wait for it to end and when it did the intrusiveness of the loud schlocky music over the closing credits seemed to crystallize all the incipient negative feelings I had been having throughout the movie I hope that this director will go back to doing smaller films that do not stretch his concepts beyond what they can support,Positive
"Music by Hans Zimmer

Inception is a mindbending rollercoaster ride that takes viewers on a journey through the labyrinthine depths of the human mind From the first frame to the last the film is a masterpiece of visual storytelling with stunning set pieces and jawdropping special effects that push the boundaries of what is possible on screenAt its core Inception is a film about the power of ideas and the limitless potential of the human imagination The concept of entering and manipulating dreams opens up a vast playground of possibilities and the film explores these possibilities in thrilling and unexpected waysThe cast is phenomenal with standout performances from Leonardo DiCaprio Ellen Page and Tom Hardy Each actor brings a unique perspective and energy to their role adding layers of depth and complexity to the already intricate storyWhat truly sets Inception apart however is its ability to blur the line between reality and fantasy leaving the audience questioning what is real and what is a dream This ambiguity creates a sense of unease and tension that permeates the entire film making it a truly unforgettable viewing experienceOverall Inception is a tourdeforce of filmmaking that combines mindbending concepts stunning visuals and topnotch performances to create a truly unforgettable moviegoing experience,Positive
Convolutedjust too convoluted and complicatedInterstellar is a beautiful film but this  is an incoherent jumble and muddle of ideas and concepts Though theyd have been theoretically very interesting and thought provoking if manageably usedIts basic premise is intriguing and thought provoking but I was annoyed and eventually bored by its overambitious and confused plotPeople who liked it must be very patient willing andor able to make sense of it much better than I do though I dont consider myself unintelligentFilms like this make me thinkare people too shy or lazy to post reviewsratings that go against the majority Because I cannot believe that the majority of the general population could reasonably follow the plot of this filmThough it has been years and I will give it another watch to try and make better sense of it,Positive
When first time watch this movie i really not understand this what happening in entire movie after that i watch twice By the way its interesting movie who looking for some scifi movies the best past part of this movie that i like which is when character go inside brain and brainstorming to someone and find the clue i love that scene Its interesting movie but sometimes its hard to understand for me when i watch this first time but maybe its not to all like me I wait for its any second part if come i like scifi movies Must watch this movie if u looking for scifi action movie this movie for you,Positive
When I saw this film at first I did not understand anything about it but then again after a few days of watching it I realized that it has a good script,Positive
Im a huge Nolan fan and I always get those goosebumps moments in his films where it just HITS me like a ton of bricks I get this movie I get the deeper meaning behind it I get the reason for it And Nolan sent that message in the most genius way Wow Its probably different for different people but some examples it was when black merged into white in Memento it was when Joker was upside down opposite of Batman and talking about human nature their duality gravity etc it was when the audience discovered the Prestige had been done on us etcHowever that doesnt happen for me in Inception I loved the movie So unique so entertaining but Im not sure if I truly GET IT Ive seen it like  times and Ill come up with a explanation and an underlying theme then secondguess it the next time I watch it Ive read many explanations or better yet interpretations of Inception online but none made an airtight case for me Perhaps thats the reason obviously he intended ambiguity but I need more At best its one film where you can have conversations with different groups and all come up with something totally different each time Thought provoking at its finest,Positive
Hiiii just finished watching the movie inception and i need to share my emotions with you after watching it Best film ever that i watched It was one of the best movies Ive ever seen Before seeing the film I read that the director was Christopher Nolan and the protagonist Leonardo Di caprio so I already knew it was wonderful Without spoilers I want to make you understand a bit of what its about is an action and thriller film lasting  hours and  minutes Talks about Dominic Cobb is a professional who takes care of extracting secrets from peoples minds while they sleep infiltrating their dreams through a special device that allows a group to participate in a shared dream Cobb and his team normally use tricks and deceptions to steal information from the victim who he believes to be in reality and suspects nothing Together with his partner Arthur tries to enter the mind of Mr Saito a powerful Japanese businessman to perform an extraction but fails when the dream projection of Mal dead wife of Cobb appears in the dream interfering with the operation I advise you to look at it very carefully otherwise you will not understand the ending well I think it is one of the best films of  because it differs from the others it is not monotonous in the plot and you can see that the director has perfected every detail in order to make it fascinating and moving I wait for you to see it and leave a personal comment,Positive
I think the film is overrated i dont like it too much,Positive
Christopher Nolan has undoubtedly become one of the most important names in the business of contemporary filmed entertainmentHe has taken us to places we did not know existedHe singlehandedly revived a languishing cartoon franchise and placed it in the pantheon of unforgettable classics In his new adventure he takes on the uncharted universe of the subconscious The premise in its scope is intriguing and unconceivable ambitioushe relies on the best movie making talent only a major movie studio can buy to achieve his goalThe special effects are terrific the acting is pretty good and the dialogue is also good but the journey that started as an unrestrained adventure into the realms of the human thought generating universe turned half way thru into a tale of semi confusing scenes The story never comes anywhere near of seducing its audience The emotional factor is completely absentThe movie is worth watching and it does stand out mostly due to lack of quality competition but it should not be an Oscar nominee Christopher Nolan has done better work,Positive
Christopher Nolan might just end up as the most alluring and enigmatic film maker of contemporary cinema Memento The Prestige Dark Knight and now Inception Nolans oeuvre is definitely one of the most creative outpourings in commerce and clicheridden Hollywood If you thought Memento teased your mind try savouring Inception It will leave you tortured tormented ticklish and tantalised with its mindplay And if you think you can actually unravel this mindboggler in one go youre asking for the moon It will leave you longing for one more dekko to get the picture straightToo many levels of reality too many things happening and too innovative an idea,Positive
A true masterpiece of its kind never in the history of Hollywood such movie had been made Christopher Nolan man hes absolutely genius,Positive
"WARNING THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR IDIOTS
This movie has a lot of theories and concepts that idiots need to learn to make earth a better place to live bravoo Nolan Most muggles are out of service",Positive
This is my favorite Nolan movie Best of all the director did an excellent job of explaining his ideas without confusing the audience Explaining the dream set in a movie is no easy task but Nolan does it,Positive
Nolans best film by far I saw this film  times in my life and every time i start a new rewatch i feel like im into a new dream experience Inception cast is amazing Di caprio Tom Hardy Cillian MurphyKen Watanabe Joseph GordonLevitt ITS A MASTERPIECE and probably the besr film of the sDream or reality Make yourself a favour and try to answer,Positive
"When I saw it for the first time  years ago I had to sit for a while and think what did I just see there After watching it many times seeing more and more how great it is each time I now believe that it is the greatest movie of all time Everything about it from the music to the acting is just fantastic cinematography amazing how the movie was conceived and made a reality pulling all the different parts together perfectly was just an impossible task It takes you to the edge of your own subconscious and brings us back so we can be young men again
Conceptually one of the best movies out Its one of those movies where the movie mystically connects to some part of actual life while conveying the message in a supernatural way Its also one of those where you learn or realise something new every time you watch it",Positive
Inception is unique and to this day years onI havent seen anything like it Stylish imaginative and always coherent the film follows Cobb played by DiCaprio a professional thief who infiltrates the subconscious of his targets to steal information When told his criminal history can disappear if he implants an idea into the targets mind he is apprehensive to accept the offer but temptation of a former life wins him over What follows is a compelling two hours of revelations action and emotion to the wonderful riveting sound of Hans Zimmer,Positive
This is hands down the greatest movie of all time No cap,Positive
"Inception is undoubtedly one of the most iconic science fiction films ever
It explains the idea of sharing a dream accessing and changing people s mind
It tells the story of Kobbthe proffesional thief and the master of his craft He enters the subconscious and steals the information that his clients need The only thing he regrets about is that he cant see his children anymore But one day he receives a deal that will change his life dramatically This operation seems to be infeasible but Kobb accepts to risk everything for his familyThe special effects are fantasticthe plot twists are unexpectable and wellthoughtout Inception is a clever and heartpounding thriller which leaves you with a strange felling that our life is an illusiona dream where everything is possible",Positive
Inception is a great movie in my opinion dont get me wrongI liked the plot and the story very much and I loved dicaprios character and story Throughout there are a lot of parts I didnt understand a few specific moments where things just dont make sense at all But still it was a fun entertaining and deep movieVery recommended for those who can understand complicated movies not very for those who cant,Positive
I have watched this movie for the fourth or fifth time and I have to admit that this film is a true masterpiece Watching this movie the second time you will notice details you missed in the first place which leave you astonished  movie,Positive
Everything from the plot to the finish is superb The ending is unreal absolute gem,Positive
Watched it for the the first time In order to enjoy this movie you need to be prepared You need to be focused and pay attention or else you will get lost You also have to be patient You needs these things to really understand this movie because this film can get overwhelming There is a lot of going on and can be overwhelming Normally when I sit down and watch a movie I like to relax on my couch and will probably check me phone in the beginning until it reall catches my attention With this movie you cant do that You need to fully pay attention and it lowkey felt like I was forced to watch it because of how much focus you need to watch this film I feel like a great movie shouldnt be that hard to watch This is why I take some points off the rating Other than that the movie is good and I understand why people give it a ,Positive
I dont get all the positive reviews for this movie I found it overlong and I could not find a reason to care about any of the characters Technically speaking there was no true heroic character as it was a bunch of technologicallyadvanced criminals and their victims At several points during the movie I was pleading Go home Go home It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling RIP probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have done it in a shorter time I really think the writers and producers could have made a tighter film with better and more interesting characters Christopher Nolan did terrific terrific work with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight but this film is unworthy of its success,Positive
Inception is one of the most fascinating and mindblowing movies I have ever watched The storyline is unique and deeply thoughtprovoking taking the audience into a world where dreams and reality blend together in the most creative way Christopher Nolan has done a phenomenal job in crafting such a complex yet engaging narrative that keeps you thinking even after the movie endsLeonardo DiCaprios performance as Dom Cobb is simply brilliant He portrays his character with so much emotional depth and intensity that you truly connect with his journey The supporting cast including Joseph GordonLevitt Tom Hardy Ellen Page and Marion Cotillard also deliver excellent performances that perfectly complement the storyThe concept of dreams within dreams is incredibly wellexecuted The visuals are stunning the cinematography is topnotch and Hans Zimmers background score elevates the entire experience to another levelespecially the track Time which gives goosebumps every timeInception is not just a movie its an experience It challenges your perception and keeps you engaged from start to finish For me Inception is the best movie ever made and I would gladly recommend it to anyone who loves intelligent storytelling suspense and scifi thrillers,Positive
Finally I got a chance to see Inception today I went in with high expectations knowing how much I was impressed by The Dark Knight Christopher Nolans first true masterpiece After watching the movie was I impressed Yes Completely blown away Yes This movie indeed is Nolans second masterpieceThe movie involves some awesome CGI works powerful acting by the whole cast and an intricate yet engaging story line Films with equally good CGI have released in the past so there is nothing new about it We have also seen similarly themed movies so it is not really the theme which distinguishes the movie So what actually makes the movie so goodOne reason is the directors ability to make you connect with every dream scene in the movie When you watch the movie during many of the dream scenes youll feel Hey something like this has happened to me before or Yes This is exactly how its supposed to happen in dreamsSecond is the plot Nolan invites you to a world of his own presents you the possibilities and the dangers of the world and then builds a plot based on that world a plot so brilliant that in the end you are left dumbstruck in awe Similar attempts have been made before Steven Spielberg for example with his Minority Report and I must say this is the best such attempt everOverall a heavily engaging movie possibly the best movie of the year,Positive
This was a neat movie though complex to follow at times I dont think  out of  is in order but I would say  out of  is well deserved Reminded me immensely of The Matrix at times Visuals were beautiful Music and dialogue were excellent though many times dialogue was hard to make out due to loud music drowning it out  Acting was also great though I am no big fan of DiCaprio who did as expected with that silly smirk on his face almost like Cloonies but the rest of the actors were greatOverall a wellmade movie with a plot full of fresh ideas Go see it but do not set your expectations to the max this way you do not come out mildly disappointed IMO it is way too overhyped,Positive
First of all hats off to Christopher Nolanfabulous job done by leonardo DiCaprio and castmust watch moviethe best Ive ever seen,Positive
It permanently made me go from casual movie watcher to cinefile over one watch Please watch this Maybe the best movie of the century Concerning my good,Positive
Christopher Nolans name is an assurance of high quality Never misses a beat This film is intricate  should be viewed multiple times It is meant to make you think about the wonders of an idea,Positive
One of the best movies I can remember seeing Does it get any better Layers on layers on layers and all the talent involved were perfection,Positive
Inception is a highly overrated film But its still solid and I would recommend it potentially based on the viewerThere are many reasons to dislike Inception a lack of emotional depth huge pacing issues predictability and an overemphasis on the concept of shared dreams rather than the plotLet us be honest the characters are rather dull And the film is so overly complex it thinks its the next Matrix its not its no where near as good Visually Inception is stunning and Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as always but this does not excuse the poor plot the music is good however Confusing forgettable but has moments of brilliance Most likely if someone says its a  theyre likely just following the crowd,Positive
Can watch a million times and still enjoy every moment  always something new to catch every time I watch plus the actors and actresses are ,Positive
It is amazing how grazy idea as invading dreams doesnt have plot holes Inception has great pacing and it doesnt have clichs You cant expect what is going to happen You can see that Nolan put his body and soul to this movieYou have to watch this movie multiple times to understand the total idea of this movie,Positive
One of the best Di Caprios movies The storyline is perfect,Positive
Best movie i was seen best scene nice cinematography and best idea,Positive
Have you ever read the story about the Emperors new clothes Its about two weavers who promise an Emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those unfit for their position stupid or incompetent When the Emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes a child cries out But he isnt wearing anything at allA dream within a dream within a dream with Cobbs played by DiCraprio wife as an intruder in his subconsciousness and if something goes terribly wrong you enter the state of Limbo where youre stuck in ones raw subconsciousness Sounds really deep and complicated right It really isnt The plot of this movie may as well be a new metaphor for those clothes that nobody could see There isnt a deep philosophical meaning behind it Its just made sound complicated enough for the viewer to be expected to draw a philosophical meaning and understand it The viewer who is able to do that is smart enoughPeople pretend to extract some philosophical meaning out of it and therefore continue praising it They do not want to be the stupid ones The truth is it is only an OK action movie it has good fighting scenes and good acting but is too long for its own good Its time for people to admit that the Emperor is really naked,Positive
An entire masterpiece of Christopher Nolan Very mind blowing movie but with an excellent story Ten out of ten,Positive
The film is a classical thriller and like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and damngood clever concept To its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not The cast deliver well DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer GordonLevitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do Im not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesnt  pay attention Doesnt quite live up to the hype but it is still a very good and engaging film,Positive
I just finished watching this movie and I am completely blown away Im sat here wondering about life and feeling just like I did after watching Interstellar I dont think theres many movies this perfect but the ones that are are clearly a mixture of great acting amazing directing a perfect soundtrackHans Zimmer as usual and overall an amazing story The whole idea of the movie is of course to leave you thinking about life and wether or not everything real and it definitely succeeded there ,Positive
Inception is a summer blockbuster that actually makes the viewers think Finally a director and crew realize you can make a film full of explosions and awesome slow motion effects with an actual complex story This is not your Michael Bay summer blockbusterIt is very refreshing to see that even though Nolan has rebooted the Batman franchise he isnt losing sight of his own original ideas Jonathan Nolan Writer obviously deserves a lot of credit for making a believable script that isnt campy and full of one liners throughout Even though there are a few but it is necessary to keep the balance of film from being one sidedThe film is a modern classic that should not be missed Whether you like Nolan or not there has to be credit given to the cast who made this insane thrill ride feel absolutely real throughoutAcademy Awards are looking promising,Positive
This movie was and is beloved by everyone so I dont expect to make any friends with my honest opinion  I was not impressed by Inception Before I first watched this film I was told that it would be complex and mindblowing so I expected something like Nolans earlier The Prestige  which was masterful and one of my favourite films Instead we get a shallow imitation of that style Inception is complex just for the sake of being complex  it doesnt add much value to the film and the complexity is just overloading the audiences working memory which is not a clever technique at all The characters were the worst part of the film Apart from the main characters they basically have no existence outside their role in the mission We dont have any other reason to care about them After a point I just completely stopped caring whether they succeeded Nothing felt compelling or of much consequence I actually cared more about Cilian Murphys character than the protagonists to be honest Because I lost my investment in the film it just dragged out and became boring especially some of the generic action scenes like the one in the snow The ending is just cheap ambiguity rather than anything meaningful That said there were some good things about the film that I enjoyed The visuals and effects were great such as the transforming cities and the zero gravity The best part was Hans Zimmers score which remains one of my favourite soundtracks Those aspects almost made up for the flaws  almost,Positive
Strange and somewhat confusing tale on a group of individuals who can enter their dreams and those of others and manipulate them into reality A mission is undertaken by them that may be seriously undermined by their leaders personal dilemma Long but watchable this is an interesting modern effort on the Science Fiction genre and a breath of fresh air in contemporary cinema,Positive
I watched this movie  times within a week and every time I loved the movie even more everything in this movie is great great concept great acting great score I think it will be awhile until I see a movie that tops this for me,Positive
Wellhave been sitting on reviewing a film since became a member of this sitenever was quite inspired to type away a few words for a movie I joined only in  so dont go what about The Dark Knight already I love my movies alright But who to break that melancholic joblessness for me but Chris Nolan I wonder if there has been a contemporary director more consistent than him at catering out breathtaking cinematic experience time and again Well he is back after two long years postponing the third batman movie for this one and we here thought It better be good Well we were wrong Whats the word ah Ruddy brilliant it is Nolan has once again got it all rightthe screenplay the editing the cinematography phew breathtaking His grip on the movie is so overpowering that an actor of DiCaprios talent who by the way turns in an exquisite performance as the troubled extractor Dom Cobb still looks just another character driven in a frenzy in a world only Nolan could make so complex and yet so coherent with all its multilayered texture Ellen Page and GordonHewitt turn in good performances while Michael Caine is charming as ever in his short cameo Because I am quite the Cotillard fan I would not comment on her performance lest it be biased In short if you have bought a ticket for this one and I am not counting on that being easy at least this weekend even here in Pune you are in for a couple of hours of a hell of a ride So long and thanks for all the fish Mr Nolan,Positive
Ive watched this movie like  times and every time ive get excited Best Nolan movie ever A true masterpiece for cinema,Positive
This movie opens another path to think in my mind  inception can be done future,Positive
This movie had leveled up peoples dream with being upside down or floating city bending explosive things Han Zimmers score was perfect for this action dream movie But then I wondered why there os so much action That is what mades the film a bit corny but at least Christopher Nolan had done an excellent job to entertain the audiences,Positive
"With Hans Zimmer by his side accompanied with enthralling music and a mind wracking plot and screenplay Nolan surely has gave his all in this film And today hes a household name for every movie goer especially the Sci fi
You need to watch it before you die",Positive
I enjoyed this movie a lot So real facts and unforgettable,Positive
Today I took a nap before I went to movie theater since I knew that this movie would be a mind blowing experience There are still parts that I did not understand but probably I will watch it again and I will understand much more better I and my friend called this mind blowing experience as Matrix effectI did not understand Matrix totally when I first watched itI should say that movie is  min but it is worth it I think describing the situation putting things together and presenting a good conclusion could not be illustrated for such a complex story in less than this durationDiCaprios character is full in depth and his struggle in his mind with his dead wife presented in the whole story so wellAlso special effects are gorgeous Some of them were used in Matrix but all those city upside down effects are awesomeI should say that this movie is a really good mind blowing experience Probably most people will say it is a masterpiece I do not know why but it is not as good as Matrix Actually when I first watched Matrix I thought as the same way So my critics could change when I watch it againI strongly suggest Matrix lovers to watch this movie Probably you will not totally understand in first time and you will definitely want to see it againI did not vote for this movie yet since I did not totally understand the whole situation there are a lot of points which I did not see or understand I will give this movie a second chance Well job Nolan,Positive
This is the second time around that ive seen Inception The first time around was about  years ago and back then it was just for the sake of watching all the best movies on IMDB I did not understand it then and i do not fully understand the end quarter of the film still but what i can say is its for sure a beautiful film throughout I am a big fan of the ending with it being a subtle cliffhanger that is not the usual cliche type and takes the film back to the very beginning and reminds of all again of the purpose of Cobbs misson Its even a bit emotional The only real complaint i have is i would have liked to know how this method of breaking into peoples minds and dreams works All in all a fantastic rewatch and definitley saves itself,Positive
A mindbending scifi thriller that turns dreams into a cinematic playground Inception is Christopher Nolan at his most ambitious Blending blockbuster spectacle with dense philosophical ideas the film follows a team of specialists who infiltrate dreams to plant an idea deep within the subconsciousAnchored by Leonardo DiCaprios restrained emotional performance the movie balances highconcept storytelling with pulsepounding action jawdropping visuals and an unforgettable score by Hans Zimmer Its layered narrative rewards attention inviting multiple viewings and endless debate about reality memory and choiceSmart stylish and daring Inception stands as one of the defining films of modern cinemachallenging audiences while delivering pure cinematic awe,Positive
This golden triangle of my favorite director Nolan favorite actor Leo and favorite composer Zimmer creates the most profound cinematic experience of all timeWhat makes Inception so powerful is how it taps into the depths of our own subconscious exploring guilt meaning and relationships in a way that feels deeply personal Few films challenge both the mind and the heart as effortlessly as this one Every frame every note in this world of dreams makes me feel more alive than any other motion picture ever hasThanks to everyone involved for making this masterpiece Im sure that Inception and I will grow old together,Positive
One of the best movies I have ever watched It is fascinating the story structure of Inception and how deep it is It is a bit long but you dont feel time passing as you are drown into the story you forget everything I like films that doesnt spoonfeed me information I found Inception one of these films that you need to stay awake and focused to understand every minute throughout the whole thing The cinematography is brilliant and the production design of different locations in different countries Leonardo Dicaprio once again brilliantly pulls off his character and gets every one of the audience involved with his amazing acting,Positive
This movie so far is the best movie i had ever seen in my life It will blew up your mind and take you into a new world of imagination The concept and the idea is fresh and powerful It grows more and more intense as the movie goes on I am a big fan of Nolan Brothers and Mr Dicaprio itself and they had proved why they are liked so much worldwide No cons and pros for this movie This is a lifetime movie A must watch for serious movie watchers You will experience a whole new amazing animation and its really good That is why this movie has won Oscar awards Watch this patiently and you will learn why this is the best of the best SO just go for this,Positive
Stunning VFX with an all star cast and amazing performance from Leo DiCap paired up with excellent writing and direction  a visual masterpieceThis film makes you dizzy but in a good way The story had a few what just happened moments but overall very thought provoking and entertainingThere were some plot and technical issues and the constant overbearing and annoying score was well annoying but the acting and visuals made it less painfulA  from me,Positive
I went into the cinema to see this film with sky high expectations given the domestic and international reviews of it Phrases like modern classic and landmark film made me think that I was in for something truly special in terms of film history along the lines of Citizen Kane and The GodfatherTurns out I wasnt well not all the way anyway I wont bother with the whole plot line since its very sprawling and complicated but suffice it to say that my main disappointment with the film stems from the fact that the thematics of the story simply are too limited and ordinary compared to the potential impact of the films gimmick the fact that you can enter somebodys dream to steal information or plant ideasThe plot revolves mainly around industrial espionage a theme which simply does nothing for me emotionally Who cares if one industrial tycoon wants to stop another The dream concept of the film is truly magical and innovative and is a very compelling feature of the film itself But why in heavens name marry it to something as pointless as industrial espionage What happened to something like the fight for world domination It would have given the film infinitely more punch if the plot had centered around some political intrigue in stead Especially given the unstable nature of the world today with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan huge climate issues and so forthThe subplot involving Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillards characters to me comes off very flat their on screen chemistry not being very strong This is a shame for the premise of the subplot has great emotional potentialAll in all somewhat of a disappointment despite the wallop one inevitably receives from the films take on the concept of entering someone elses dreams,Positive
I am astonished by the reviews posted My only explanation is that this deadly dull movie put everyone else to sleep and they thought they saw a better movie The performances were very lackluster and the actors all except for Tom Hardy looked like they were performing in their sleepThere was no reason for any of the characters to be involved in this plan from a personal motivation reason and their behaviours were completely arbitrary Did they get paid for their time or was there some other reason to what they were doing in this scheme with the main character I felt no connection or empathy for the main character or his motivation There was no sense of unreality or mystery one would expect in a dream The action sequences were dull and seemed to be just shooting people because there was a perceived need to have some gun fire I struggled to stay in the theatre and see it through let alone stay awake,Positive
I need not brag much about His Highness Christopher Nolan any more Everybody knows hes an out of the box genius And if anyone has a doubt go watch Inception right this moment Its meant to be watched at least twice The first time it just gives you a glimpse of his work And when you watch it the next time you can actually pause to appreciate each and every minute detail of his Masterpiece Meanwhile you cannot ignore other significant stake holders of brilliance Hans Zimmer and Di Caprio Now this is what you call Awesome Background Score I can bet hes given out his all The last time i saw Di Caprio he was still a kid And look what that kid has grown to become THE Dom Cobb Hats off for his on screen performance In nutshell i just hope that Inception doesnt become Nolans ONLY Masterpiece The Benchmark for a Perfect Blockbuster has just been raised  Go figure out for yourself,Positive
"Id make this review in pointsFrom the side of directingevery thing is amazing an terrificall cadres are impressive and his way is very sensible and effective
Nolans way doesnt make you feel boredhis way push you to think and think and think a lotabsolutely he is on of the most professional and great directors nowadays
In this film Nolan doesnt depend on the performance of the actors more than the way of directing and of course the script and terrific story
A very advanced technology is used in the scenes and was very amazing
Finally i think this is the best movie of that type you can see",Positive
My second favorite movie of all timeYou mustnt be afraid to dream a little bigger darlingI think its impossible to dream bigger than thisAn idea is like a parasite and Nolans idea is one simply brilliantThe plot is fantastic complex but not too difficult to followIncredible character interpretation I dont mention anyone because I would risk disrespecting someoneIts not just an action or science fiction film there is also a strong sentimentality its not too difficult to get emotional Time by Hans Zimmer really gives you chillsYet another Oscarwinning film from NolanInceptionthe Kings SpeechOh I forgot the ending is also unique perhaps the most iconic ending of all timeOur dreams feel real while were in them its only when we wake we realize things were strangeI watched this film  times and I still love every little detail of this masterpiece and if Im still sleeping please dont wake me up,Positive
Inception remains one of my favorite scifi movies alongside  A Space Odyssey and Interstellar The soundtrack is incredible The ending has one of my favorite songs from Hans Summer All the characters are really likeable and the story is fun and exciting Some of the action scenes blew me away the first time I saw the movie as a kid and they still put a smile on my face They encouraged me to watch a behind the scenes on how they were shot I would highly recommend this movie to anyone regardless of what genre of movies they enjoy,Positive
I always hear about this movie from my friends for example or even from people in social media but I didnt give it a chance now I feel some regret that I didnt watch it with my friends this movie is incredible and make you think about how if its happened in real life  in the end this movie worth the time I spent watching it,Positive
"Its was awesome movie to watch But we should watch without any distraction if we have then missed movie
Nolan creates more unimaginable facts that make movie more strong 
It risky to take this type of movies Becax huge things have to create and exicute
Anyway must watchable movie 
Dont Miss it",Positive
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen,Positive
With physicsdefying thunderous action heartwringing emotion and an astonishing performance from DiCaprio Nolan delivers another true original welcome to an undiscovered countryThe story can either be told in a few sentences or not told at all Here is a movie immune to spoilers If you knew how it ended that would tell you nothing unless you knew how it got there And telling you how it got there would produce bafflement The movie is all about process about fighting our way through enveloping sheets of reality and dream reality within dreams dreams without reality Its a breathtaking juggling act and Nolan may have considered his Memento  a warmup he apparently started this screenplay while filming that one It was the story of a man with shortterm memory loss and the story was told backwardsLike the hero of that film the viewer of Inception is adrift in time and experience We can never even be quite sure what the relationship between dream time and real time is The hero explains that you can never remember the beginning of a dream and that dreams that seem to cover hours may only last a short time Yes but you dont know that when youre dreaming And what if youre inside another mans dream How does your dream time synch with his What do you really know,Positive
WAY OVERRATED Makes you wonder if IMDb should rethink their ranking formula Id say Inception deserves a  or  But to be the  movie of alltime you need character development There was none Zero zip nada Were told that heres Leonardo and heres an Asian guy who wants him to go into a dream and thats it Boom now start the action I will say that the concept was very good It could have been a great movie if they would have left in some action but cut out about  minutes of it and substituted character and dreamsequencesplot rather than just wild chasesshootouts During these parts I found myself very bored,Positive
You will definitely change your ratings and your opinions of this movie once you will get to watch Paprika  by Satoshi Kon the real master mind behind the ideaChristopher Nolan just made some  or  changes in the movie but it made the movie worstPlease Watch Paprika if you think Inception was movie worth watching it will definitely make you think again when rate movie above The lift scenes  dream collapsing merging of dreams with reality and all other stuff which made you think its a clever piece of cinema well its just happens to be completely a rip off from Japanese anime movie paprika just check it out yourselfhttpwwwimdbcomtitlettreffnaltt,Positive

Inception is what cinema wants the audience to feel and more a dream that ceases to be fake on every conceivable level Its a metafilm that comes full circle with its implications as to what the audience can take away from a truly impactful movie whether all the story was a dream or not whether most of it actually happens until a certain point or whether the story has no right way to interpret itThe story is relatively simple for Cobb hes a man trying his best to clear his name and return to his family in America and he needs to plant an idea into the mind of a media moguls son about to inherit his fathers empire The rest is something else entirely Cobb is a master dreamthief who has inner demons of his own and he keeps these demons at bay even if it means risking the mission at handInception is a blockbuster that has the makings of an art film populating an actionadventure story and making the absolute best of the scenes Nolans given This film has classic moment after classic moment the dreamelevator the rotating hallway scene the carchase the snow fortress and Limbo make for some of the films many golden moments The set pieces are amazing the direction is flawless and the imagery does evoke the sensation of dreaming Nolan makes his films have a beating heart to them and Inception is full of it through and throughInception is the kind of reason that I can say is the reason I love movies From its ambitious story to intricately done characters and setpieces add up to one of the most wellmade films to ever grace the planet This is Nolan at his very best and more Inception gets  goldstars,Positive
Inception is a truly mesmerising experience This movie is completeacting on another levelthrilling action sequencesHans Zimmers breathtaking soundtrack Storys originality and screenwriting is genius Inception is the movie of the year and the movie of our dreams,Positive
This is my favorite movie of all time Every time I watch this film I discover something new and am amazed Great cast great acting cinematography storyline directing and thrills I love when a movie has a good story and uses good dialogue This film will provide the watchers with that Because of that its never a bore and maintains its relevancy When the movie first came out I went and saw it three times in the theaters Its a film that leaves you thinking and awestruck at how the human brain works Christopher Nolan is also one of my favorite directors This is a timeless masterpiece,Positive
"First time watching this movie I cant understand whats happening in this movie after  to  minutes its blow my mind I really appreciate all the actors acting especially Leonardo Dicaprio
thats a very good movie",Positive
The movie was good from the beginning and it has a very intriguing plot along with some good action scenes I did find it a bit hard to follow sometimes but I eventually knew what was going on most of the time You need to be really focus when watching the movie and possibly watch it more than once to understand it fully,Positive
i was really excited about the release of this when i watched it on the big screen i enjoyed it but it wasnt the prestige or momento it was similar to the matrix i was expecting the Nolan twist but this didnt happen there was mixed messages through out the film ie Michael cane when will you come back to reality maybe i got it wrong but i dont think he was in a dream in a dream in a dream but i think Nolan lost himself a bit in this one it is a good film very good but not the best id be happier to see a Nolan film with a  million dollar budget and i think hell pull a masterpiece of with it brilliant films can be made with small budgets i dont claim too be a film critic this is just an opinion,Positive
I am a huge Fan Of Christopher Nolan Since Memento he is in my Opinion One of the Best Directors Of the Last  Decades Inception here reminds probably to be his best Movie together with The Dark Knight I dont want to Spoil here anything so i just can recommand it to everyone to watch this Movie it will blow you away,Positive
The movie grabs you from the start keeps your attention on the screen so good that you dont even want to blink and as every good movie does leaves you with many whatifs and questions about real lifeThe movie has a lot of action with scenes developing in various places from ordinary city streets to high snowy mountainsThe details and presumably hidden messages keep the viewer focused and able to not only see the picture but also to feel the plot itselfI would say that the back story of the characters could have been explained a bit more extensive but nevertheless it is clear enough for the viewer to create their own idea of the characters personalities and motives One of the things that grabbed me was the way the end leaves the viewer with so many questions and possible interpretations that the whole internet exploded with discussions after the movies premiere,Positive
Very complex idea executed perfectly An immersive ark masterfully crafted with great editing and direction,Positive

"If anyone ask me what is the name of your favorite movie 
I will say inception is one of the best movie i have ever seen 
This movie is deep  If you hate complexity avoid this movie Current IMDB rating 
Sooner or later it will hit top 
Enjoy yourself  ",Positive
The plot is relatively complex for an average watcher like me but once I fully wrapped my mind around it I was truly moved Nolan did an incredible job in this movie pouring out his soul and making a masterpiece The acting was also incredible making me feel like the actors were actually in the situations The overall message this movie conveys can truly change someone,Positive
I couldnt wait to watch this film but boy was it disappointing It was a fantastic idea and yes it looked great However the main problem for me was that the characters were drawn so poorly in conjunction with the visuals that I did not really care what happened to them I loved Momento and The Dark Knight but the crucial difference is that I cared about Guy Pearce and Christian Bale It may be perhaps that I do not rate De Caprio but I could care less about what his predicament was I even tried watching it  times to see if I was missing anything but ended up getting annoyed Visually stunning there is no doubt and an amazing concept but emotionally shallow,Positive
When this movie was about to come out my friends were excited to see it but I was hesistant and didnt understand the hype at all It looked generic When we alll went to go see it in  it turned out to hit every cylinder I had and was in perfect alignment with every preference intellectual curiosity and personality need I had Its like it was made just for me and only meMultilayered plot extended and uncovered narrative core love story within a SciFi context character team dynamics that are fast paced and engaging visuals that will lure your attention and a depth of ideas that uncover a whole universe of possibiliy The exposition may be outlined more than subtle but it does keep the movie cohesive and streamlined Not a perfect movie in general but perfect for its own definitions Also a soundtrack to play for the next generation,Positive
"GO WATCH INCEPTION NOW
From director Christopher Nolan who has made some of the best films ever made such as MementoThe Dark Knight TrilogyThe Prestige and Interstellarcomes InceptionThis movie left me speechless and took my breath away the first time I saw itThe action in Inception is awesome because most of it takes place in the Dreamworld which leads to some of the most creative action scenes ive ever seen in a movieMovie is not really the appropriate term for Inception It feels more like an experienceSome people will not like the film because it will make you think about the movieeven after its overBut if fine with that then youll love this movie
The casting in Inception islet me put it this way
one of the best things Christopher Nolan can do for a movie is direct a cast of actors and he does just that with InceptionLeonardo DiCaprio is amazing in this moviedefinitely his best performance since The Departedand everybody else like Joseph GordonLevittKen WatanabeMarion CotillardEllen PageTom HardyCillian MurphyTom Berenger and Micheal Caine give performances just as good as LeosHans Zimmers score is amazing like it always isand the cinematographyI would go as far as to say that this is one of the best looking films I have ever seenso good job to Wally Pfister and basically anybody else who worked on this movieIts still bedazzles me that Christopher Nolan hasnt won an Oscar for any of his movies yethopefully Tenet is amazing and he will get at least one Oscar from that
IM gonna give Inception a ",Positive
Christopher Nolans Inception didnt just entertain meit rewired how I think about storytelling On paper it sounds like an overcomplicated heist film set inside dreams In practice its one of the rare blockbusters that trusts the audience completely rewarding attention with layers that keep unfolding long after the creditsWhat makes it my favourite movie is how perfectly it balances spectacle with emotion The set pieces are iconicthe rotating hallway fight the folding cityscape the slowmotion snow fortress assaultyet none of them feel like empty fireworks Every action beat is tied to the rules of the dreamworld and more importantly to Cobbs internal conflict Leonardo DiCaprio gives the film its beating heart making grief and guilt feel as tangible as any explosion Marion Cotillards presence as Mal is haunting not because shes the villain but because shes the emotional consequence of Cobbs pastNolans direction is razorsharp the pacing is relentless the exposition is surprisingly elegant and the parallel dream levels build tension like a perfectly engineered machine Hans Zimmers score doesnt just elevate scenes it becomes part of the films architecture turning time itself into suspenseBut the masterstroke is the ending It refuses to handhold inviting you to debate whats real and what isntwhile also making you realise that the emotional truth might matter more than the literal answer Inception is thrilling intelligent and strangely intimate Its the kind of film you can watch five times and still discover something newwhich is exactly why its my favourite,Positive
My first Nolan movie and I immediately became his fan after this This movie will make you question and continuously test your thinking If you havent watched it do it RN cause youre in for a thrilling ride,Positive
Inception is a movie that blew the majority of us away when it was released into cinemas worldwide But it left many wondering about the character Cob which I wont mentionAnyway Inception is about a group of very skilled people whose job it is to enter other peoples dreams to alter their real life ideas and decisions The main character CobLeonardo DiCaprio and his friend and colleague Arther Joseph Gordon Levitt are tasked to perform something called Inception from Saito Ken Watanabewho is the owner of a powerful corporation And his goal is to bring down another company to make his the leading company in the world of energyDirector Christopher Nolan The Dark Knight  does a very sterling job as he delivers a fantastic film with lots to enjoy from chase scenes beautiful scenery and a twisting story lines Nolans choice of cast couldnt get any better as they all impressed me with their super sonic performances Nolan also adds a layer of complexity about the dream world to deepen the concept You wont all understand it straight away but a little thought and you should get thereFurthermore there are scenes which blow me away with suspense and thrill Especially when learning about dreams and who Cob was recruiting for his team Their strategy to complete the job from Saito is very interestingOverall This film is an amazing experience to watch and will not keep you bored for any second Top performances from DiCaprio GordonLevitt and Ellen Page and great cinematography to lose yourself in Nolan has produced an mind blowing piece of film which is still talked about today,Positive
Before I saw this movie I wasnt sure if I was ever going to see something that I would consider perfect This is absolutely my favourite film of all time it has absolutely everything going for it The premise is incredibly smart and unique and is executed in a way that allows the viewer to discover things for themselves The cast is top notch in this movie with Leonardo Dicaprio the stand showing that he has true knowledge of this subject The rest of the cast does everything right and all have perfect chemistry with each other The heist itself was so well done and mad me fell as if I was in a dream and anything could go wrong at any time The heist gets more and more intense with every passing moment and the ending literally turned my mind against itself as I do this day am still trying to figure it out This made Christopher Nolan one of the greatest directors of all time and made a movie that I consider to be perfect,Positive
One of my favourite movies of all time I was in awe after the first time I watched it and I couldnt wait to rewatch it again Ive watched it a total of  times now and I am still so fascinated and intrigued by the storyline in this Obviously Leo is one of the best of all time and my favourite actor Cant get enough,Positive
I watched this in the cinema when it came out in  I was only  then and couldnt really grasp the entire movie as it is challenging on its own let alone for an  year old But I remember leaving the cinema completely enthralled by the movie and loving it despite not fully understanding every bit of it Since then I have watched it more times than I can countEvery single actor in this movie gave their best and Nolan outdid himself with this one Truly one of the best movies of all time ahead of the game since it came out  years ago Deserved all the Oscars Tom Hardy was my favorite in this one he added the charmWatch it,Positive
Inception takes the concept of dreaming and turns it into a movie however its not done as creatively as something like eternal sunshine of a spotless mind Looking past that there was good potential for character development but really the only character who even feels remotely developed is the main one I was loving the first minutes of this movie but after it explained all the rules instead of doing something creative with it it just squared it literally dreams within dreams within dreams And Inception turned out to be nothing but an OK action movie that found legit excuses to make half the footage in slow motion In addition i did despise how the hype with the main characters wife was set up for some epic encounter and then rewarded our attention with just a melodramatic conversation in the end On the other hand it did offer some splendid effects but like all movies with such effects they have nominal value and as time passestheir real value diminishesThis movie deserves a  and nothing more,Positive
Nolans movie is a piece that explains how amazing the imagination creativity and experience act in our subconscious The color and script from this film isnt complety original but the thing is that the films are also a tool for explain something harder to understand a world a dream It isnt just about dreams it is how we really are humans,Positive
An all star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio Ken Watanabe Tom Hardy  Cillian Murphy  othersA great but complex film about a team of thieves who specialise in entering the dreams of their victims in order to steal their secrets from their subconsciousIve seen this film  times  highly recommend watching it if you havent already but be warned it requires unbreakable concentrationThe storyline is very imaginative but complex as the team enter dreams within dreams within other dreams so if youre not concentrating  you miss something its likely you will become confused  even disinterested in the rest of the film probably why Ive had to watch it  times lolGive it a watch or  You wont be disappointed,Positive
This is by far one of the best movies Ive ever seen,Positive
I missed this movie to watch actually when it was released here Suddenly i came to watch this movie and i am sure it was one of the best movie of With Leonardo and Joseph this movie packs a whole bunch of entertainment The idea of such movie was never used before that makes it one of its kind I had to watch it  times to fully understand the movie lol the moments runs one by one and also the Visual effects are stunning never felt they were used thoughThe cast is perfect for the movie and it seems Christopher Nolan has improved to the last edgeA must watch movie and truly entertaining Thumbs up Worth every  you pay,Positive
LOVE THIS MOVIE I like to live in the moment so there were some parts of the film that flew over my head BUT but on the second viewing I caught a lot more of the little nooks and crannies that makes this movie so good,Positive
Incredibly suspenseful movie I was drawn in so quickly to this film only to be tossed around in the huge waves of thrill and suspense in this movie If you want to explore the world like its never been conceptualized before this is the movie for you,Positive
I had huge expectations for this film reading all its glowing reviews And yet even before it started and the menu fired up alarm bells were going off Explosions left right and centre great CGIall suggested a lack of substance For the first  minutes I couldnt believe just how bad this film was Drop the viewer into a complete state of confusion to look goodexcept that this is always a risky strategy one which a only few films have eloquently pulled off the nearest comparable being The Matrix which this most certainly isnt although it tries so hard to be in terms of style and delivery Yes the CGI and special effects are at times breathtaking Its just such a shame that the storyline was utterly ridiculous disjointed confusing dispassionate and so very very boring Great effects DO NOT make for a great film necessarily A note on casting Like the film this is truly awfulwhat on earth was Leonardo Di Caprio thinking My wife totally embraced the subject matter she fell asleep and the only thing stopping me from dozing off was the desperate hope that that this film would improve It didnt Inception completely encapsulates all the worst in Hollywood Utter rubbish,Positive
Theres nothing this film does wrong Any complaint I can muster is nitpicky about the cadence of certain scenes or decisions made in the cinematography etcFilm is packed with memorable sonic moments and beats is driven by stateoftheart acting and effects and a plot that is just another installment of Nolans genius An unmissable addition to the American canon of great film,Positive
Very confusing but great film some of the visuals are just incredible,Positive
I watched this movie with extremely high expectations and they were still surpassed This is arguably the best Nolan film Everything is great from the acting the writing the cinematography its all good Highly recommend,Positive
Just rewatched this masterpiece and its still one of Nolans best and most creative films Like who thinks about stuff like this A dream within a dream within a dream If I could have even a fraction of Nolans imagination Id be thrilledTheres a sense of completion in watching Nolans films youre not left wanting more and you dont think that Nolan shouldnt have added the last  minutes But more importantly theres a sense of completion in the movie itself and its complex characters Nolans strengths are his amazing character arcs and keeping the story together Every time I watch a Nolan film Im in awe and this is no different,Positive
If your brain is feeling flabby take it to Inception for a good workout Christopher Nolan once again tells a fascinating story in a very unique way I also applaud Nolans decision to not do this film in trendy D Im sure I will be thinking and dreaming about Inception for days to come,Positive
No words Just awesome Every thing in the movie is lovable Acting  And omg the screenplay  the idea was just awesome Just loved it Fav movie ever,Positive
It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating it is quite literally breathtaking What can I say that hasnt said before Not much its the story the acting the premise but most of all this movie is about how it makes you feel Sometimes you watch a film and cant remember it days later this film loves with you once youve seen it you dont forgetThe ultimate story of friendship of hope and of life and overcoming adversityI understand why so many class this as the best film of all time it isnt mine but I get it If you havent seen it or havent seen it for some time you need to watch it its amazing ,Positive
This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick It has a great and deep message This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hopeOther than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever He was inspiring intelligent and most of all positive His performance just made me smile Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd Red Redding played by Morgan Freeman Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Reds group James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been institutionalized The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates some of which deserve a second chance Whatever you do dont listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever It has everything you could possibly want,Positive
I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption Shawshank encompasses friendships hardships hopes and dreams  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you it gives you hope  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different you dont feel that far removed from what the characters are going throughIt is a simple film yet it has an everlasting message  Frank Darabont didnt need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film the narration and the acting does that for him  Why this movie didnt win all seven Oscars is beyond me but dont let that sway you to not see this film let its ranking on the IMDbs top  list sway you let your friends recommendation about the movie sway youSet aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie,Positive
Ive lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie but it is more than  It has to be one of the best movies ever made It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors beforeI have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movieNot everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movieSomething that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action no special effects and no gimmicks  of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the endFor me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it no matter how many times I have seen itBrilliant brilliant movie and a must see for everyone,Positive
Two imprisoned men Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman bond over a number of years finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decencyIs this the greatest film of all time IMDb would have you believe so Despite being a box office flop that barely recouped its budget the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting story and realism It has since been successful on cable television VHS DVD and BlurayAnd it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year Now twenty years old the film has not aged a day and instead seems to be getting better This is Tim Robbins best role and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman,Positive
The best movie in history and the best ending in any entertainment business,Positive
One of the finest films made in recent years Its a poignant story about hope Hope gets me Thats what makes a film like this more than a movie It tells a lesson about life Those are the films people talk about  or even  years from you Its also a story for freedom Freedom from isolation from rule from bigotry and hate Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances Each learns from the other Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as BrooksHe shines when it is his time to go back into the world only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink Stephen Kings story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement It is an extraordinary motion that people will be talking about in  or  years,Positive
I still cant quite get the enormous reputation of this film I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery the mystery got thicker It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman James Whitmore etc butthe most highly rated film ever I dont get it The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film I love Morgan Freemans voice but hes telling us what were seeing So the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never really arrives The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbinss psychological journey Credible or incredible doesnt quite matter I did go with him without asking too many questions Morgan Freemans humanity is contagious and inspiring whether credible or not because I bought it So a masterpiece No Good even very good Yes,Positive
I had been meaning to see this film since it is rated  on IMDb It is a very good film and very well acted however no wayyyyyy is it the best film of all time Morgan Freeman is particularly good as Red and the other actors perform very admirably but I dont find the film overwhelmingly powerful Ive seen many many films that do more I rate it a  out of ,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption has great performances extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax One of the best dramas of all time,Positive
It is a timeless tale of hope and resilience that remains deeply impactful to this day Set within the confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary the film intricately weaves a narrative of human spirits triumph over adversity and the enduring power of hope Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver captivating performances infusing life into their characters and making their journey truly unforgettable Under the skilled direction of Frank Darabont the films storytelling unfolds seamlessly drawing the audience into a world of despair and redemption Through its exploration of friendship injustice and the pursuit of freedom The Shawshank Redemption resonates with audiences worldwide leaving a profound and emotional impression that lingers long after the credits roll,Positive
This movie surprised me so much I watched it twice in one day the first time I saw it Sure I hadnt just picked a movie at random at the local DVDshop but I didnt expect it to be so good After I watched it I had a look on the IMDb website and was surprised once again that i found it placed number  on the top  movies list I wondered to myself why didnt I know about this movie Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite wellknown actors Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in  when the Green Mile was released Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television because it surely isnt on television often enough or it could just be me not knowing very much about the filmworld before  For in fact everyone in my school seemed to have known the Shawshank Redemption for a very long time One of the best movies ever my best friend said My favorite movie in the whole wide world another one of my friends THEN WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME I replied If you liked the Green Mile Im telling you now youll love this,Positive
It is a cinematic masterpiece that delves into the profound human experiences hidden within the darkness of a prison Tim Robbins portrayal of Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freemans captivating performance as Red create an indelible bond that transcends the boundaries of their confined world Director Frank Darabont weaves a poignant tale of hope friendship and the pursuit of redemption against the backdrop of injustice and despair The films visual splendor and evocative soundtrack enhance the emotional depth of the story leaving audiences inspired and deeply moved Finding Beauty in the Shadows The Shawshank Redemption reminds us that even in the bleakest of circumstances the human spirit can find solace and beauty making it an enduring and cherished classic,Positive
The characters are so well developped and well interpreted by the actors that you really feel for them which makes the whole story even more compeling The structure builts up emotionnaly like only Darabont can do it Breathtaking,Positive
Theres a reason this is rated the   It is the same reason you watch this movie every time you see it on tv even if its already half way over Its captivating brilliant and full of heart Its one of the best films ever made,Positive
Could a movie be any more perfect This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways Acting perfect storyline perfect soundtrack perfect emotional drama perfect everything about this movie is perfectWhen this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and its popularity grew Eventually after many years in the top  of IMDbs top  movies of all time list it hit number  with over one million votesThe story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison As the years go on in his new home he makes friends enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie historyI love this movie The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins And also William Sadler Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it isOverall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit,Positive
"There is no denying that this is a very good movie The acting is great and it tells a good story Personally I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste but its far from a bad film On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes
This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie not because its a great one",Positive
I cannot possibly realize why this movie is rated in top movies There is nothing new in this film and there isnt anything in it that makes it special Wake up people Quote Bill Hicks Piece of ShtOK Ill give it that there isnt anything to complain about the acting or directing etc But this entire movie seems to be a compromise I also think that the success of this film is based on the least worst principle and that makes it badIm also fed up with the narrator and all the dramatic film music All this seems like fishing Oscar nominations Am I really the only one who can see how transparent this is I doubt it so please vote movies that really will make difference,Positive
It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me Watching very very impressed What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway Acting on cues can say is enormous Theres no posturing Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyones lips Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into Finals if he so exhilarating you a highquality music And finding that deserves really deserve I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars Will remain as the best film in more than  years I believe wholeheartedly sites Definitely one of the best films in the world,Positive
It deserves ten stars Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit although some may not have the patience for the slowness But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm emotionbuilding pace such as this Otherwise one would never get to know Tim Robbinss quiet accountant and what makes him appear alternately shy snobbish and suicidal all at the same time or Morgan Freemans genialbutcynical lifer not to mention how hes a man who knows how to get things I love what the film doesnt do it doesnt make an issue of its two leads being different races although one could claim that makes their friendship all the more marvelous it doesnt pull any sensational farout action punches as films with an allmale cast often do and it doesnt freeze its characters into types Everyone is real and everyone is flawed from James Whitmores bird loving veteran to Bob Guntons pretentious icy warden But the finish which really starts around the films last twenty minutes is one of the most powerful and moving things ever committed to film Get it in either format,Positive
One of my favorite movies everThe Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes placeBased on a Stephen King novelthis movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic filmTim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd Red Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despiseThis film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this factIt was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Actor  Morgan Freeman Best Adapted Screenplay Best Cinematography Best Editing Best Original Score and Best Sound but didnt win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest GumpI personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his careerBravo to this brilliant modern day classic,Positive
I first saw this film like many others by chance and on DVD And like others I have since watched it over and over again When I feel sad it makes me feel happy when I need hope it gives me hopeWhen I want to reaffirm my very belief in life and all it can offer this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doingIt soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself The portrayal of friendship the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls Thank you Mr Darabont Mr Robins and Mr Freeman Thank you to every one else involved You changed my life,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption should have won Best Picture for  A story of banker Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison the movie is beyond amazing In prison Andy meets Ellis Boyd Red Redding Morgan Freeman who was imprisoned many years earlier Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth Over the next twenty years Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail beatings by the guards rapes by other inmates and so on But he never gives up hopeThis movie like Carrie The Shining Dolores Claiborne The Green Mile and Hearts in Atlantis just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is When we think of horror we think of spooky horror but The Shawshank Redemption is a different kind personal horror Pure genius I can only hope that in the coming years this movie is recognized as what it is a masterpiece I cant believe that it won no Oscars,Positive
We have all see movies comedies action and dramas We all liked ones hated others got into some other even and felt like part of it In Shawshank Redemption you start slowly after a while you get attached by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else then comes a last  minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics I felt warm strong happy and all other emotions one can think of I felt I was the one who won who got out of prison i was simply fully satisfiedThis movie must be used as an Antidepression by therapists this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldnt give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different  much higher rating scale than the Oscars its simply over qualified,Positive
I cant say much more than I was incredibly underwhelmed by this film Perhaps it was that I had been told what a great film it was by all and sundry but I found it utterly average  I am afraid I just didnt get what was so fantastic about the movie  Dont get me wrong it was an entertaining film but not the masterpiece I was lead to believe it was Sorry,Positive
He that lives upon hope will die fasting  Benjamin Franklin Frankly I really dont get the praise for this film It wouldnt even be in my Top  The only thing my spouse has been able to glean from researching the topic on the internet is that psychologically people seem to like the film more and more upon repeated viewings Well that and Morgan Freemans calming voice Not that challenging cinematically and a bit of a fantasy that pawns itself off as gritty realism to be honest Not to be an alarmist but part of me wonders whether this film would be Exhibit A should the country ever descend into a fascist dictatorship much like From Caligari to Hitler by Siegfried Kracauer examined German film during the rise of the Nazis after World War I There is something going on on a group psychology level here that bears examination,Positive
This movie is one of my all time favorites Undoubtedly one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen Story cast screenplay all are great The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing and couldnt be more accurate It was narrated by Morgan Freeman who is the best narrator in Hollywood I believe Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels It will change the way u think about things around u Surely It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a mans bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hopeI can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen  or ever will see If you havent watch it yet just GO Watch it Now,Positive
Three words Oh My GodHow am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and unbelievable film in words I dont know But Ill give it a shot Here goesThis movie is just bloody excellent brilliant fantastic unbelievable not a thing wrong with it shocking in a good way heck pretty much every single good comment word you can think ofI mean for gods sake its so damn good it takes your breath away i seriously could not speak after it it instantly took every other film i had seen under its shadow and thats saying something as i have seen some pretty excellent filmsTheres not a single actor or actress in this movie who is crap standouts are Morgan freeman Tim Robbins and the dude who plays brooksI could say xinfinity more things good about this movie but unfortunately I havent got that much space and my fingers would get soreAn absolute must see for everyone and Im positive that ill never see another movie better than this and this will stay at  on my list forever,Positive
People look for all sorts of things in movies and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie  Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen  Others are action junkies  Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot or the niftiest angle  For all of these there is the very real chance that they simply will not get this film and thats too bad  they are missing out on a classicAt its best film can transcend merely being a series of pictures no matter how pretty and can reach down and touch people  That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly  It is not the fastest moving movie not the edgiest not the grittiest it is filmed in shades of gray  But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done  And THAT is filmmaking at its finest  Not a game not eye candy  this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled,Positive
This for me and many other people is the greatest movie of all time it has amazing directing it has amazing acting by Tim Robinson and Morgan freeman whoever says that they dont like this movie should never watch another movie again overall the greatest movie of all time,Positive
The first time I ever saw this movie I was just floored at how incredible it was What wonderful casting that was done to help this amazing story be told Stephen King has a way about creating such memorable characters For those of you who think this movie is a prison movie you are sadly mistaken This movie merely takes place in a prison but this story is about so much morefriendship hope survival and dreams There is a reason this movie is voted  on the IMDb site Not only have I enjoyed watching this movie over a hundred times but I have been lucky enough to have been in that prison numerous times doing paranormal events My last visit out there was last weekend and I decided to also go and visit all of the filming locations That was a real treat All I can say is that if you have not seen this film just take the time to watch it and just take in the amazing story and the incredible performances turned in by the cast I promise you that you wont be sorry,Positive
This is Tim Robbins best performance ever It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent manAndy Dufresbe who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life He meets a mentor in RedMorgan Freeman and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners but also of the prison guards Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away,Positive
A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is Greatest movie ever made Get real Its not even the greatest prison movie ever made Hell its not even the best movie released in  Its predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clichs Its also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe Still its an entertaining movie Nice direction from Frank Darabont Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast Tim Robbins however is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly staresoffintothedistance moments Hes so far beneath Freeman as an actor its sad With a normal movie like this I would focus more on the positives I did give it a  after all Unfortunately it is easily the most overrated movie of all time on IMDb for sure and as such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack,Positive
Oh come on nd best movie ever I dont think so  Its unrealistic and overly sentimental the people who voted so high cant have seen many films By all means watch it but Papillion for example is far superior who can forget Steve McQueens red rimmed eyes and pasty face as he catches bugs and crushes centipedes into his watery broth to get nourishment in that incredible portrayal of hardship and determination  I wouldnt put Papillion as the nd best film of all time but it has to be the best Prison drama  Watch Shawshank and youll enjoy it as a lightweight entertaining feel good movie but there are so many classic films better than this,Positive
MINOR SPOILERS AHEADThe story begins with the court case of Andy dufresne for the alleged murder of his wife and her lover the first few minutes at the start captivate you from the beginningAndy is wrongly convicted and sent to Shawshank maximum security prison set with a double life sentenceAndy finds a new companion called RedMorgan Freeman the man who can get things for anyone in the prison for the right price As a person that can get things or has been known to locate things from time to time for somebody Red doesnt find it particularly odd that andy asks him if he can get him Rita Hayworth in Of course he acceptsThe line that defines this great piece of cinema is get busy living or get busy dyingThis movie is without a doubt one of my favourites and remember always FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE,Positive
i watch this movie for minimum  times first to last so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time its a piece of art and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence so i rate this movie  out of  because of amazing screen play acting casting background scoring editing etc this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake,Positive
not for a reason but for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories its themes the tension the moral questions the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation are bones of a splendid film a film who reminds more than presents values roots of justice beauty of original source the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer short  a film who must see ,Positive
"An overrated film that I watched as a teenager and recently decided to rewatch I must say right away that I like this film but it is undeservedly and too popular and occupies the first line  this is completely undeserved in comparison with other films of more talented authors
I am very saddened that people do not see other works and for so long this film has been number one among the best films The actors are talented the plot is just good not brilliant like Stanley Kubrick in A Space Odyssey Even this I am ready to see in the top but not Shawshank Redemption I understand that many will disagree with me or say that I just hate but this is not true and you can understand this by comparing it with other films is this film so good and does it deserve the first place",Positive
This movie is annoying in several ways  The criminals are all goodhearted thoughtful sensitive guys while the guards and warden are the REAL bad guys  gimme a break  What is this  Dukes of Hazard which was far better than this  Further the plot is so so so predicable  Good guy outsmarts the bad guys and real justice is served spare me  I know a lot of people love this flick but in my humble opinion it is a big waste of time,Positive
One of the best movies ever made Simple as that Top  ever and top  of the s The ending is just so powerful,Positive
This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen Andy Dufresne wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover finds the strength not only to change himself but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion from haunting and chilling to stirring and beautiful When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry music and its atmosphere and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction it is a triumph  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity  It doesnt pretend to be clean nor could it be called a family movie  It is brutal and violent at times horrifying and sickening at others However the title says it all Redemption is what this story is all about  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art  This is what movies were meant to be,Positive
Like many of the reviewers I hate prison movies with all the clichs and stereotypes of innocent prisoners nasty guards and evil wardens and upon first viewing many years ago I especially disliked being forced by this film to feel sympathy and empathy with murderers rapists and the likeShawshank has somehow transcended the test of time and I believe that it has endured not because of the great performances which dont seem to be acting at all but real not because of the simple but multilevel story line with its twists and turns not because of its magnificent photography not because of its score and not because of any individual element that went into the making of this film Hence the lack of academy awards However when all those elements are combined Shawshank becomes one of those masterpieces which is greater than the sum of its partsand this film is so much greater that in the desperation of its characters it invokes a multitude of good emotions in the viewerthat there is divine poetic justice and hope in this hell of a worldShawshank has become my favorite film of all time but it took a while When yourre feeling down and out watch Shawshank Raising my vote from  to  however subjective that vote may be,Positive
It takes audiences on an unforgettable cinematic journey exploring the indomitable human spirit and the pursuit of redemption Tim Robbins delivers a compelling performance as Andy Dufresne a man wrongfully convicted and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary Through his unlikely friendship with Red portrayed brilliantly by Morgan Freeman the film delves deep into the complexities of human connection and the transformative power of hope Frank Darabonts directorial finesse brings Stephen Kings novella to life painting a poignant portrait of resilience amidst a harsh and unforgiving prison environment With its thoughtprovoking themes stellar performances and emotionally resonant storytelling Finding Redemption The Shawshank Journey continues to captivate audiences earning its place as one of cinemas most beloved and timeless classics,Positive
Little more than average drama for popular tastes Predictable  overly sentimental and excessively longIts a mystery to me that such a mediocre piece of cinematic art is at number  in the all time chart However predictably its not in the top  more serious Sight and Sound  critics and directors polls that are held every  ten years Frank Darabont later proved to be no master with his two following films the second rate The Green Mile and the truly appalling The Majestic The fact that this pedestrian movie is in this chart ahead of the works of  real masters such as Kubrick Welles Kurosawa Fellini and Hitchcock causes consternation,Positive
Nice title   best one i have seen my dude couldnt get any better,Positive
i watched this movie just to pass out some good time and you know what i had sore and wet eyes at the end i dont know why but the movies end couldnt stop myselfandys portrayal by tim robbins and reds by morgan freeman was absolutely greati like and love andys philosophy that hope is a good thing  and i have tried to inculcate that in me i just loved the movie i was like whats this its ended so fast i didnt it want to end i am not a con and neither i wanna be but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths i mean that they also have got something in them their hearts the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great it shows that when you want to do something do it with full heart i have just finished itbut im sure i m gonna watch this very often and am not going to forget it for a long length of time,Positive
I dont care if there are some poor souls who would like to belittle this film Just think of these misfits as beyond redemptionI saw this film in  and still vividly felt the euphoria of the final half hour which stayed with me for a couple of weeksI was convinced this was the best film I had ever seen in my life even better than Akira Kurosawas Ran and One flew over the cuckoos nest which was my all time favorite until TSR came alongI excitedly contacted my best friend who shared the same passion and he confirmed my thoughtsthis must be the best film Ive ever seen But it is sad though that I will probably never see a better film for the rest of my life as I have seen the bestIn music I have heard the best in Rush and Jackson Browne which made others pale in comparison and in movies I have TSRHail Frank Darabont,Positive
At the time of writing this comment IMDb ranks the Shawshank Redemption as No  in top  best movies of all time Let me tell you that this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDbs strict rating criteria Shawshank is indeed up there amongst the best and if you havent seen it yet you should make it a point to watch it at least once sometime in your life For it is an astonishing tale of endurance courage life and perspective combined with a stunning score that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it could make grown men cry No words can explain how good Shawshank really is but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by devotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness,Positive
"I liked this film That sums it up pretty well This film is good in some aspects very good but the best film of all time I usually dont say this but I think The Shawshank Redemption is overrated I dont want to take away from the performances the story or the score those were really good I guess Opinions differ and thats fine For me personally the fact that I knew that this film was the highest rated film of all time unfortunately hurt my experience I was expecting a lot more which in the end I didnt get
But still a good watch nonetheless",Positive
THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION   Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman Bob GuntonClancy Brown William Sadler James Whitmore Gil Bellows Excellent adaptation of Stephen Kings novella Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption with falsely accused of murdering his wife Robbins facing hard time in a corrupt prison and a solid friend Freeman in an unforgettable Oscarnominated performance of stoicism Great acting and above the preconceived prison film genre that also breaks away from the clich of the human spirit yet enables its elements Nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture Screenplay Adaptation and Director,Positive
Ive been content to lurk and learn on this web site for months but after reading the reams of glowing critiques of this film I felt obligated to get an IMDB account and print a contrary point of viewThe Shawshank Redemption is an obvious thinly characterized visually uncompelling film  Whether its the good guybad guy cliche or the  white guyblack guy cliche its still the same old HollywoodThis is not a film which discovers life through enigmas dilemmas and reflections  It is a film which wears its rather plain message on its sleeve out of    For prison flicks try Dancer in the Dark  Someone else recommended alternative prison flicks Kiss of the Spider Woman and Cool Hand Luke  I heartily agree with those choices,Positive
Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen It is the only movie Ive seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes I would and do recommend this film to anyone and everyone,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption came out in  and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video peaking as the most rented video of  in the USA A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of RedMorgan Freeman and Andy Tim Robbins Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance where the human spirit eventually prevails The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast The score is deep and haunting this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart To me it is the best film of the s and quite possibly one of the best of all timeThe fact that this film is sitting at No is a testament to just how many people love this film many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film and I dont blame them I only wish that I could view the film for the first time again and experience that redeeming feeling Andy and Red experienced at the endIgnore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience the last half hour are especially beautiful Watch this if you already havent and enjoy the masterpiece that Frank Darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing ,Positive
It is an extraordinary cinematic masterpiece that unfurls a profoundly moving tale of hope friendship and the unyielding human spirit Tim Robbins portrays Andy Dufresne a man unjustly imprisoned for a crime he didnt commit while Morgan Freeman delivers a captivating performance as Red his fellow inmate and confidant As the story unfolds within the walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary the film explores the resilience of the human soul and the transformative power of hope in the darkest of circumstances Directed with skill and sensitivity by Frank Darabont this timeless classic weaves a tapestry of emotions leaving a lasting impression on its audience Hope Unchained The Shawshank Redemption continues to inspire and uplift reminding us that even in the face of adversity hope can set us free,Positive
This film is easily in my top three favorite films I return to it time and time again still captivated Bravo to everyone involved in this timeless production,Positive
Its amazing how long I could not watch this movie However I became interested in them only after reading the book And the book is very good However the same can be said about the film Yes there are some nuances ,Positive
Decent entertainment somewhat memorable Why this is seen as such an incredible sensational work of art is beyond me I feel like this is one of the few crimethrillerprisonaction related films that met my expectations as in was A Good Film but that alone doesnt make it a classic,Positive
Satisfying good movie but the only great part of this movie is the magnificent performance by Morgan Freeman An apparently inspired Tim Robbins rises above his very mediocre talent and delivers an adequate performance Hamhanded attempts at profundity in every scene get tiring as is the use of every prison movie device character and cliche in the history of hollywood,Positive
It has a formula that gives you this kick Darn what a good movie But I need to say this sometimes it happens So WHY do people love this movie and rate it high when or WHY isnt the smart people declare it like a a peace of art Or do they Still I think its darn goodbut I bet the producers didnt expect thatLike when we vote for anything we need to follow our heart This is a typical movie that is worth every penny every letter and its a typical  movie Oh there we have it Between gone with the wind and now we NEED this Love me as I am says the storyline in my head anyway And I do yes I do,Positive
The classic can be recalled repeatedly Andy is full of yearning for life and freedom To get out of prison is a new life for him and red who has been used to prison life has become numb To get out of prison is death for him,Positive
THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen Kings more restrained kind of stories dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale endsTIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN who plays the narrator with great dignity describes himself as the only guilty man in Shawshank The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape Along the way he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that theres a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing A touch of irony here no The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison talebut still they make an impact because of all that happens beforeIts a bittersweet story a sort of horrific fairytale of what might have happened but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful storytelling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay,Positive
Im not going to tip toe around it this film is crap Its completely unoriginal its not artistic its not demanding except for being boring You will not learn anything about the world through this filmThis film is not a part cinematic history unlike nearly all other films in the top  It is predictable and emotional crapBut even if your not into cinema and you just like popcorn entertainment there are far better movies out therebasically any on the video shelf,Positive
the Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him all the other actors perform perfectly this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it I first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it the setting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me iam finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest films ever made in my time and i love it,Positive
By far the best movie everNo Doubt this is the best ever movie you will ever see It is easily the best movie of my lifetime so farMorgan Free is a legend and Rest of the Crew did a marvellous job as well Well written  narrated and directed movie of all times out It has been on number one ranking on IMDb and most of the other movie rating websites forever nowThe best past of the movie is narrated voice by Morgan FreemanThe character Andy Dufrain is a very well composed and the Warden character has lot of punch into itEscape from prison was the best it can ever getMarvellous piece of Art,Positive
Along with Q and Pulp Fiction Frank Darabont The Walking Dead original writer and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made its money back in US theaters which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home and it made such a splash that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple  years ago This includes some of Hollywoods best critics including EWs Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B back in late  Yet over time this story of redemption like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end grows on you to the point where at the very end you have no choice but to clap I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I havent looked the same since Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films He made Robbins human made Morgan Freemans voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it wouldve swept away the Oscars Sorry Ralph Fiennes The English Patient won on a weak year,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie I watched this movie for the umpteenth time A movie I would never ever get bored of Written  directed by Frank Darabont this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope friendship  redemption Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins the faith The more times you watch it the more you love it and the more you learn from it Whatever you do dont listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film It has everything you could possibly want in a movie If you dont love Shawshank chances are you are beyond redemption It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece Its in my top five movies of all time I feel so bad about not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late nineties,Positive
This is the best movie I ever watched in my entire lifewhenerver I feel sad or depressed I always watch this movieit always gives me hopeHope is a good thing,Positive
This film is perfect in every sense of the word The second the movie starts it grabs you and holds your attention for the rest of the film It is never boring All of the hints that lead to the finale is absolutely genius and the attention to detail is perfect The third act is the best of all time Roger Deakins gives one of his more subtle works and it plays out beautifully The dialogue is perfect and you deeply care about the characters,Positive
OK youve seen the summary and youre screaming What kind of sour limey b says that about one of the greatest films ever made Well Ive got news for you look again The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie i agree but is it all its cracked up to be  no At first you think I feel great  what a feelgood movie One cant help wondering that this film on closer inspection is actually unbelievably cheesy Every other second i was hearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder he didnt commit Its stereotypical  and you guys who voted  bought it hook line and sinker But what about the great twist Ok the twist was good but come onlike i said before was it THAT great Ask yourselves honestly was that better than The Sixth Senses or The Usual Suspects Also how come foreign films which are far superior to this get no credit Watch Le Samurai or La Haine or Todo Sobre Mi Madre Far more superior,Positive
this film is very convincing hokum nice gentle inoffensive and insubstantial story about prison life  I came away feeling prison was a place where nobody says fk or fears bending over to pick up the soap check out Freeman in the token performance of his career neatly basking in the falsely accused smart white gentleman robbins shaddow what a team so very progressive hope  oh yeah weve got a lot of hope going on here The lush fantasy kind so deadly sweet and full of bull frank darabont is a gifted man who excels in making pretty pictures that strike at the very heart of american pie values and gives them a welcome support by elevating tokenism to its greatest levels in hollywood yet  that is no small achievement considering if you dont believe me check out his latest masterpiece he just cant stop doing it hell why not it sells tickets,Positive
Hope is a good thing maybe the best thingsaid AndyIve been told a couple of times this movie is a mustwatch before I die A movie with almost all actors and in a prison is a bit masculine to me Yet I occasionally read it on Wikipedia and also saw that in Netflix by chance I gave it a goOn the ground of some personal experience I could feel how Andy feels This movie is about persisting faith of oneself and of life even for those serving lifetime sentenceGet busy livin or get busy dyin is the best quote If you are in search of a powerhouse movie this would be the choiceI am from Hong Kong I would also recommend The Greed of a Man a Hong Kong drama and Itaewon Class a South Korea drama The male lead achieved their lifetime goal spending long enough time like Andy We all know they are fictions but so what Just learn the message,Positive
Best movie ive seenThis movie  years on is still first class,Positive
So worth seeing in the theater thanks to fathom events and th anniversary plus Stephen King turned  recently I admit Ive been on the fence about enjoying Shawshank Redemption for a while but seeing it in the theater and re watching after not seeing it for a long time I cried I laughed felt sympathy and was very immersedTruly remarkable and well deserving of every good opinion even after I was on the fence about it I love the movie a lot now Tim Robbins embodied such a glorious character Frank Darabont made such a crafty dark and heart wrenching experience Fathom events is excellent I am glad I paid over  dollars to see such drama perfected film,Positive
"Ive watched great movies The Godfather The Lord of the Rings Trilogy Citizen Kane Casablanca Lawrence of Arabia The Mummy  The Green Mile Silence of the Lambs E T the ExtraTerrestrial  A Space Odyssey etc Inasmuch as they are outrageously great none of them come close to this absolute masterpieceIn a world where theres so much despair so much crime so much death and destruction you would think theres no light at the end of the tunnel But nope This movie reminds us that despite the trials and tribulations we face everyday theres one thing that cannot be toppled
HOPETo live without hope is to cease to live  Fyodor Dostoyevsky
Get busy living or get busy dying  Andy DufresneThis movie in my own opinion is the greatest movie of all time",Positive
Tye movie is just perfect The acting the story the characters are just so good that they will even make you cry,Positive
The emotions the plot originality everything tied together so well at the end  normally I criticise the way movies end but this ending was phenomenal not cliche at all The brutality of the prison was well portrayed and made me feel sorry for the charactersAll the characters were believable and had depth and none of the scenes were dramatic but there was tension throughout the film Im going to stop fangirling now but this movie is my favourite tied with the Godfather,Positive
I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind At this writing this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made The SECOND BEST EVER MADEWhy This was my questionThe acting is good Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition But these are not truly great actors and in any case they are only asked to play appealing persons deliberately lessdimensional than real as opposed to believably hyperreal which is much harderThe director is a firsttimer and it shows There is simple framing and staging here In fact there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this filmThe story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow All the chunks are the same size with no fancy rhythm There is no distracting backstory No element has irony not writing acting shooting even the scoreNow for me I expect and demand art in my films  thats why I register this as plain But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense It is straight and honest people seem hungry for honesty and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right timeIs a film great because it merely fulfills I hope many people think not and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts,Positive
"Absolutely the most movie overrated i have seen 
There are movies that deserve this rated and have not been talked about As for this movie it is worth watching but it does not deserve this rating",Positive
The acting is adequate the story is adequate but why all the fussIt sometimes baffles me why some movies get such high ratings when they are really only run of the millThis is not that bad a film just seen it all before,Positive
This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichs and predictability Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities These artists show their capability to produce art real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you The Shawshank Redemption delivers muchneeded breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forgetThese artists show their capability to produce art real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you,Positive
I have long viewed the Shawshank Redemption as the most underrated film of all time  That isnt to say that it wasnt universally acknowledged by the moviegoing public as a great movie but in terms of awards critical acclaim and best ever lists this has somehow kept on losing out  Now that I see it has the number two position as voted by the moviegoing public on probably the most accurate best ever list in the world AFI be damned I am eminently pleased  There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best picture over Shawshank  Certainly Forrest Gump is a charming wellacted film but it is nothing compared to this  Morgan Freeman excels and Tim Robbins turns in his best performance  If you havent seen this masterpiece get up and rent it immediately,Positive
I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely one of my all time favorites A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE HOPE  One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving  finding something that we dream of In the words of this movies protagonist  hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan FreemanA must watch if you havent,Positive
This Is Such A Classic And One Of My Favorite Movies Always Loved Watching This Movie,Positive
Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDbs alltime best  films everThe casting is superb Morgan Freeman is Red a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate whos made connections so he can get contraband to other inmates for a price hes under a life sentence for murder Tim Robbins is Andy a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to  life terms for killing his wife and her lover which helike most other inmates say theyre not guilty of And Bob Gunton is Warden Norton who when we first meet him is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline While fortunately Ive had no first hand experience Shawshank certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its societyA long movie most of it takes place inside a semicorrupt state penitentiary in the late s Red in talking his thoughts out loud to himself becomes our narrator for many developments As the story unfolds increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations And in Andys work for Warden Norton we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral characterall show and appearance and with no integrity substanceIn Roger Eberts first review of his two of this movie he said the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth despite everythingthe word redemption is in the title for a reason Most viewers will agree,Positive
Since I bought a lot of years ago a videotape with two Stephen Kings short films one of them The Woman In The Room directed by Frank Darabont I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become one of the good directors in the filming industry and here we are with another Kings story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade s of course with the help of nonetheless but mr Freeman and mr Robbins who could have spoiled it,Positive
Watching this film made me think about the genre of prisonmovies and what the theme really is in these stories All of them seem to have some common elements the warden is a psychopath there is almost always some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way there is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the human spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances And maybe that is what shawshank wants to tell us that the strong individual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means In this story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure visits in the hole many times without developing psychiatric phenomena In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a piece of fiction as lets say starwars is It is simply not possible to stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if you live in constant fear The movie is highly entertaining but should not be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison environment where inmates are treated as garbage Dont fool yourself on this account Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of Andy Dufresne isRegards SimonPs When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist If you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews,Positive
"This film will stand the test of time 
And it will remain one of the best films ever madePlease do not remake this gem 
It must be left aloneSuperb",Positive
Andy Dufresne Robbins a well educated banker is wrongfully convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in prison at Shawshank Penitentiary This movie follows his life as it falls apart and he succumbs to living as an inmate surrounded by hardened criminals and a strict bible thumping warden with his henchmen prison guardsSaw this movie years ago and was absolutely stunned This film is a genuine masterpiece and probably the greatest movie ever made Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are amazing and just steal the show as convicts turned best friends The movie is perfectly paced with very real characters and emotions that are all captivating The prison itself is very authentic and the set pieces are very realistic which captured the prison environment better than any other prison set film except for maybe Escape From Alcatraz Even as a hard drama this movie is never slow or boring or dry it is simply just that good,Positive
What would you do if the world came down on you wrongly sentenced for a crime that will take all your lifes time youre quite gentle and quite shy dont feel the need to shout or cry so you take it on the chin accept the view and settle inThen distractions take their toll incarcerations in control prison guards dealing in pain fellow cons who cant refrain new friends help youre not alone surrounded by these walls of stone movie pinups play their part to lift spirits and keep good heartSoon the governor fills his tills makes the most of all your skills hes an unforgiving kind but theres money to be mined you disperse what you collect keeping covered all aspects knowing channels have been primed and overwhelmingly begrimedPerpetually entertaining stuff,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself It is not about a person in prison it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by God I watched the movie for the first time some months ago That evening I was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay home Being unhappy about that I started watching the movie on the TV just by chance not knowing about its existence before that at all At first I was skeptic I admit that But oh God at the end of it I was screaming and jumping in my room at  AM It gave me so much emotions and so much hope I had never felt before that I could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way  so excited so happy about my life leaving me believing so much in my own self It is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do In The Shawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak just the opposite  gives you wings to fly away from fear fly closer and closer to freedom Morgan Freemans voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive Tim Robbins act is just beyond perfection I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or just bad about something I watch the movie It has become my personal shrink making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it Can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after  years,Positive
This movie is one of the best I have ever seen I first read the book and I didnt liked it that much but then I saw the movie And thats a things thats never happened to me before the movie was better than the book Its the other way normally But in this case the movie is so much better I like the end more than in the book Watch the movie it is great,Positive
Before watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time I really didnt think much of it I thought it had probably wrongfully earned the  spot here on IMDb and couldnt be better than The Godfather for example A movie that was cool to like if you will I could imagine fashion conscious moviehipsters discussing movies over their glasses of Napa Valley Chardonnay arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the most and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical messages You get the ideaIm sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made has been said better in one of the other comments That said the reason Im posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isnt only a hardcore movie freaks wet dream While its brilliantly written has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the fantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont you really dont have to be an expert of film theory to appreciate it It appeals to so many different groups of people and so many different human feelings at the same time The weaknesses it had as it came out the idea of a jail movie not being compatible with the female population and the idea of a movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible with the male population is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption is loved by nearly all It offers something for everyoneIn my opinion rating something  is a bit too absolute for anything but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing and my first  I think Ill let it slide this time,Positive
This is a normal average movie  People are just hyped because it is in   And I dont think those people have seen a lot of movies  Its way too much overrated in my opinion  My honest rating would be ,Positive
Come on guys According to the IMDb Top  THIS is the second best film EVER Better than Citizen Kane Better than Godfather Part II Better than ALMOST EVERYTHINGNo its a very very long very very predictable very very cliched very very oldfashioned and sentimental film blessed by some good performers especially James Whitmore who alas does not figure prominently enoughIt worries me that many of the comments  here seem to think the film artistically transcends the usual Hollywood fare when in actual fact it wallows in all the conventions of its genreI give it  mainly because I like Tim Robbins and Morgan FreemanThe only people who could mistake this for a Great Film would be those who mistake the works of Stephen King for Great Literature,Positive
Probably yes acting was good plot brilliant I mean Stephen King wrote the book but it cant match the film When I sow this movie I thought thats it this is it best movie ever Sure you can find people who didnt like it and when I ask why and try to guess what then happened They just confused themselves they can say reason why they dont like this movie When I try to read comments with  star I cant find comment with good reasons that could make me realize that this movie is a bad movie If there is no reason then this means that its the best movie ever madeThe only reason people are giving  star is that they dont like ratio  they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down I really hate them  Sorry for my bad English language I live in EUrope my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge,Positive
The greatest movie ever made Period Pure and simple it is what every director hope to achieve The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it meansIt will bring tears to your eyes It will make you think how you have lived your life so faror in fact how you have wasted it It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely The performances are simply mind boggling be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a directorIf you havent already seen it please do otherwise you are missing something,Positive
Like I did a few years back you might be hesitating about watching this film The title didnt appeal to me and neither did the subject matter so it was only by chance that I started to watch itI can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which whilst they leave an impression leave the wrong one ie that there is no hope in life Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the messagethat there is ALWAYS hopein any situationPlease watch this film and the watch it again Its a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there,Positive
Why do you like this so much It steals directly from every other GOOD prison movie Ive ever seen The Great Escape Escape from Alcatraz Midnight Express you name it Because it allows the hero to be raped its somehow brave or profound or heaven forbid realistic Far from it folks The work of hacks only the MAIN performances are redeemable How bout that warden quite a  dimensional character that one As are all the peripherals Its bad but in an average hollywood way Of course its overblown but it entertains decent enough in that much Nothing memorable infact Id have forgotten it totally if it werent for the persistant and oh so undeserved praise heaped upon it But hey if it does it for you more power to you Just dont talk about its power in front of me I may puke,Positive
Quite deserving of such acclaim the acting is superb the storyline captivating and the cinematography quite beautiful The storyline itself was unexpected and I quite enjoyed watching it unfold Tim Robbins is really incredible in that his character comes off so subtly And lets be honest how can any movie narrated by Morgan freeman be bad,Positive
"After ten years I watched this movie again I wanted to see whether my thoughts will change or not because ten years ago I did not understand why this movie is at the top Still I think it should not be even in top  movies because nothing is special Years are passing just like a moment I could not feel his pain or hope In one scene he wants something than bum it is happening Again for one scene his situation is so bad than guess what happens After just  seconds he is good So you never go top or down during this movie My suggestion is it is better to watch this movie without the number  expectations
The best coutes
I have to remind myself that some birds arent meant to be caged  Red",Positive
This is definitely one of my favorite movies  it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once  Tim Robbins you make my days a little brighter  thank you,Positive
This is the best movie I have ever seen In a way I feel I am in a prison of life myself Restricted to doing certain things Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free I hope and dream for it sometime This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie Although critics say Tim Robbins didnt do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this roleI can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I feel whenever I watch itI am glad to visit IMDb I never heard of it before Some  years ago I saw it at no in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane But that is about past and this one is about hope and freedomI give it ,Positive
This movie taught me to never lose hope The sheer dedication persevere and sheer will to stay so long in the jail and do well It teaches humans to be humans and not losing hope and facing the issues instead of giving up  procrastinating and when life beats you down you get up and face it and not lose hope ever Many people can be your foes but you fake it till you make it I will never forget this movie and its teaching of continously adapting to the new changes instead of giving up The friendship in the movie despite the age gap teaches about how communication can be so fruitful to the new generation and old generation to maximise human relationships So this movie is the best lesson that has happened to me,Positive
I do not know what to say I am just bored Many people say that is the best Movie False,Positive
The greatest film in the history of world cinema Theres nothing beyond it periodI honestly cant remember how many times Ive watched it I have no idea how many more times I willEvery single time its the same emotion the same feastYou watch a film and your life changes This is that kind of filmThe most special moments of my life happened while watching this movieI grabbed everyone who hadnt seen it by the collar and made them watch itIts ten times more effective than any kind of medicine meant to lift my spiritsThis film is also a teacherIt taught me so much about the concepts of hope and happinessIm glad you exist The Shawshank Redemption,Positive
Frank Darabonts The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless masterpiece that transcends the confines of its prison setting to deliver a profound and deeply moving exploration of hope friendship and perseverance The film based on a Stephen King novella is a meticulously crafted narrative that captivates from beginning to end Its a story of an innocent man Andy Dufresne who finds a way to endure and even thrive within a brutal and dehumanizing system The performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are nothing short of iconic their chemistry creating one of the most compelling onscreen friendships in cinematic history The films dialogue is sharp and poetic and its pacing is masterful allowing for a slowburn narrative that builds to one of the most satisfying and emotionally resonant conclusions in filmIs it a remake of another film No it is not a remake It is an adaptation of Stephen Kings novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank RedemptionIs it worth watching Absolutely The Shawshank Redemption is a classic for a reason Its a powerful and beautifully told story that is as inspiring as it is unforgettable,Positive
"The greatest movie of all time Just perfectionMovie is done exquisitely in every detail Acting Directing Cinematography Score and StoryFor me its a perfect movie if you check all these boxes ESPECIALLY the storyThe story was nothing short of perfect Didnt leave anything out Every aspect of the movie left me satisfied covered all groundsFirst Injustice in the legal system which is a widely talked issue how Andy had to help himself and get freedom justice by himselfSecond how many people of power abuse religion to their own use They appear as holisticreligiousangel like yet down deep they are frauds who invest in religion to their own benefitThis point is covered and satisfied successfully The warden and the policeman got their revenge from andyThird how these people spend their whole life in the institution to the point they know nothing but it Feel lost Cant live without itFourth
in the beginning andy struggled tremendously Yet with time he had great bonds especially with Red Even with such gruesome environment he was able to connect with someone on a deep lovely levelHe got redemptionrevenge on everything WardenGuardsThe systemhis abusers and everything lived his life happily in Mexico and did was he always wanted to do with his friendStory really makes you satisfied as a viewer Didnt let me hanging or anything just satisfiedAmazing acting by Tim and Morgan",Positive
a film about freedom not only because the story has as scene a prison but for the force and grace and precise of creation freedom of actors and director ideas and dialogs whole script and special emotions of viewer it is a rare film because it represents more than brilliant acting or smart script it is a homage for basic values and eulogy to friendship it is representation of a form of revolution who can be considered fruit of a different religious perception it seems be perfect and this is key to be more than a goodinteresting film but an extraordinary cinema lesson Red Rita Hayworth poster and Andy Dufresne that is all at first sigh,Positive
Ok so this isnt exactly a bad film but its extremely hard to see why it holds the no position in the top  films The acting is fine the twist is gratifying if a little predictable and some of the shots are fantastic However the film is let down by unrealistic dialogue especially on the part of Freemans character who does not seem able to construct a sentence without using a string of metaphors and similesThe prison warder is a onedimensional villain with very little allure  we the viewers are not credited with much intelligence Because he is a villain it therefore follows that he must a be a Nazi no Cue references to bookburning etc Furthermore the portrayal of Tim Robbins character as Christ is slightly offensive check out the shot in which he is shown with his arms thrown up to heavenIn true Hollywood style there seems to be about five endings  when we think that the excitement or otherwise is over another sequence is tagged onto the end Despite some fairly violent scenes life inside Shawshank seems actually rather appealing  a library plenty of time outside the cells This combined with the films massive length means that for my mind The Shawshank Redemption merits only a ,Positive
This movie is a total piece of manipulation It does have a few redeeming features though  Morgan Freemans narration all through is pure art This guy acts with his mouth As a piece of fiction it has some merit and I can see why many people would enjoy it But to be classed as one of the best movies of all time  really Cmon Certainly the portrayal of the brutality of the guards during those times I would say is fairly realisticThe one part of the story where an old timer gets released does ring true There are many people like that who are totally institutionalized and do not have the skill to survive on the outside without a good support network in placeThis is a movie for those people who like everything laid out perfectly for them and doesnt require any thinking Personally I like a bit more depth and realityI dont want to put people off seeing it  it should be watched once But for me the flaws outweigh its redeeming features,Positive
This was my first time seeing this movie and I absolutely loved the movie The drama and the story were really interesting of the whole movie The violence was also very interesting of the film it shows what its like in prison after committing a crime and it shows what friendships in prison It shows a lot of the film just like escaping prison and Reuniting with a friend you have not seen in years Very emotional and very good film the director made this masterpiece well done and well made The cast were really good and the acting was really impressive We need another Shawshank redemption because the first one was amazing also VERY RECOMMEND TO WATCH,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is the best film ever made in the history of world cinema The Best Hollywood Film Of AllTime A Masterpiece A cult classic A legendary Epic A Film that you moves you leaves you stunnedPerformances Tim Robbins is astounding his careers finest after Mystic River Morgan Freeman is masterful his careers finest after Million Dollar Baby Others are excellentThe Shawshank Redemption is cinema at its very best My salute to this flick A true Masterpiece I just love this film The most powerful film of alltime,Positive
I enjoyed reading Stephen Kings short story Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption from the book Different Seasons more than watching the movie However its still one of my favourite movies of all timeIt has very few peers and has to be seen It is Awesome,Positive
A film about a Stephen King story Directed by Frank Darabont      Who  Starring Tim Robbins      Wasnt he the guy from Howard the Duck  I admit only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie  Now the only questions I have to ask are  Why didnt EVERYBODY go to see this movie  and Why didnt Morgan Freeman win the Oscar  Tom Hanks is a fine actor but he should never have beaten Morgan  Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus  Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date and Mr Darabont take a bow  Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach      Perfect,Positive
I really liked this movie which I just recently saw for the first time strange indeed since it is more than  years old It reminded me naturally I would say to Papillon the s McQueenHoffman classicI like the story the acting basically everything and I definitely recommend it to everybody But compared to Papillon There are so many similarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came out of the blue Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared with Papillon And Papillon is simply even better It is emotionally much more touching and when even Freemans great performance doesnt match Hoffmans there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen  in that role I mean Tim gave a great performance but his role didnt give him the chance that Steve hadAnyway a joy to watch But please watch the original too its not oldfashioned at all I can only guess but I think the huge differential of  for SR and  for Papillon is because most young people have never seen Papillon,Positive
This movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic brilliance    The direction is nothing to write home about the cinematography is frankly standard  The script has Steven King written all over it  a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors  A good example the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoners interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience Its all about TIME and PRESSURE just in case anyone managed to miss the connection Morgan Freeman is as usual superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand  While the films sympathetic liberal political stance can be commended its certainly not a great work of art,Positive
Its times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the shelf Its been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad the worst review Ive given in weeks was a  to Flightplan This film obviously didnt break my streakI went into it knowing next to nothing only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time that it was based on a story by Stephen King and that it took place in a prison Needless to say it blew me away I wont say a thing about the plot just so that others whove yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me I will say this though It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see One in particular stands out above the restNot much can be said about the actors that hasnt been said Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career and even though Ive only seen  or  other Tim Robbins movies Im sure the same can be said for himThough I dont agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made it was still a very good very well made very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film,Positive
When i rented the movie i was doubtful whether to rent it or not Then i started watching it From the very st moment i was kinda sure it wud be worthy watching this and worthy it was The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins the direction and everything puts you in the place of the actors making you feel the way they felt This movie doesnt have any dirty romance or impossible actions rather it focuses on a greater philosophy  Hope to live when there is no hope survival  This is one movie that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching I wont say anymore the rest is upto you to find out when you see the movie,Positive
The first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption I was only  At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion As I have grown my taste in movies has also Still I rank Shawshank as my favorite film the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life If you have not seen this film I pity you Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster I implore you step away from your computer go out to the nearest store and buy this movie Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person So if you are yet to see this film you must in the words of Andy Get busy livin or get busy dyin,Positive
I totally adored the concept of hope in this film I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers thats pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy Now Morgan Freemans got talent I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank You know theres a lot more to say about this movie its too good too be true Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes the most moving scene Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place Im starting to regret not reading any of his novels And kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie,Positive
When i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like After watching it i thought it was a brilliant filmfantastically acted with greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton Very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time At the end it made me cry and thought about life Every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye Fantastic film and worth watchingits really realistic film and another one of stephen kings great stories a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing  if you havent seen this film already then watch it it is brilliant just brilliantbe prepared to be moved its such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours A truly lovely magical film my favourite of all time fantastic,Positive
It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime The cast and the story of the movie are really successful Andy is a passionate character and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence It is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison Oldfashioned prisons in the s are full of bad guy who dont expect anything from the life And  they dont think how we escape here However Andy with his close friend in the prison  Red  tries redemption from this prison by the time  Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison But  Andy approaches to place of exit It is actually amazing  it is really incredible They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life Also Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail After the redemption  they become free anymore It is really an amazing movie Easily one of the best movies made during the s and definitely one of the top prison movies of alltime Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well,Positive
The redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence Darabont had no idea he was making anything profound  And he wasnt  This is a film about a prisoner who  well I cant give away the plot for its much better to come to the screen in ignorance but anyone who thinks that this is a story about how Andy finds out the truth about himself or is in any way redeemed is grasping at straws  These elements play so little role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore themI have a theory so many people have told Darabont that The Shawshank Redemption was a profound lifechanging experience that he believed them and then SET OUT to make another profound life changing experience with The Green Mile with predictably ghastly results  I havent seen The Green Mile yet so I cant be sureDont get me wrong  A great movie neednt be profound and the film which I think is the best ever made isnt profound either  it contains no comment at all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind  Still The Shawshank Redemption isnt even great  Its a very good story very well told  Lucky we get such nice photography rather than having to put up with Stephen Kings prose every step of the way   Also Tim Robbins has the lead role  Lucky again that it wasnt Tom Hanks  now THERES a frightening thought  Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent so well as he can  Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie but I dont think it makes such extravagant claims about itself which is why it works so well,Positive
Whats going on here At the moment I am writing these words The Shawshank Redemption is rd in IMDbs alltime top I dont think the movie is particularly bad but to rank it even in the Top is a crime against a lot of brilliant film makers further down the Top and even more people whose works dont even appear on the listSo now I ask if anybody can please explain to me  Why is this movies average rating over  Does it appeal to some basic American sense of justice and love of happy endings  Why did more than  people rate it Im pretty sure it wasnt nearly as commercially succesful as The Lord of the Rings or the Godfather with about  votes Did it do well on video in the USAnd if you REALLY feel like watching movies about people behind bars why not give Cool Hand Luke or the  classic Caged Heat a tryI dont mean to demean The Shawshank Redemtion or anything but I just dont get its massive rating Is this one of the most overrated movies of all time Well according to the statistics of this the odds are that you do not think so But would you then please be so kind as to explain it to me Feel free to email me,Positive
I finally decided to see this film after reading good reviews and noting that this film ranks in IMDBs top ten list currently  At the very least I disovered where all the noble people are theyre in prisonThe film is decent but it certainly isnt what I would call great or extraordinary There are good performances by Robbins and Freeman but the pace of the movie is very slow and the cinematography is unremarkable Characters are largely stereotypes the story is somewhat formulaic and sometimes ludicrous and the noble prisoners vs wicked guards dichotomy is simplistic and unrealistic I was also particularly annoyed at the narration which always seemed to explain more than it needed to As for the ending I guess I was not as suprised as others since I did read the Stephen King novella many years ago Still given that the story takes place in a prison you dont need to be a genius to guess part of itThis movie reminds me of Dead Poets Society in terms of its tone and theme of uplifting the human spirit against a backdrop of despair If thats your thing youll love the movie Its not really my thing,Positive
Storyline is really good so its a story from Stephen Kings book how can be bad But thats not enough to be the top rated movie of all timeBut people are confused about something That thing is this movie is not the best movie of all time it is the highest rated movie That makes it doesnt matter your age or gender or what genre you like youll like this movie Yes it can be your favorite movie but objectively I wont trust your opinion on movies that muchThe movie has really good acting and screenplay and these are the most important things in a movie Also Costume Design and Set Decoration is really good But this movie average quality of Cinematography Scores and Sound Effects Okey maybe that scores or cinematography is not bad but we are talking about the top rated movie of all time The Green Mile is directed by same person Frank Darabont And that movie has amazing Screenplay Film Editing Acting Cinematography Makeups Costumes Art Direction and Set Decoration All of them are really good just scores are average But as I sad in this movie we dont have amazing Cinematography Film Editing Original Scores,Positive
Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover He always professes his innocence but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red Morgan FreemanDirector Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story Its his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow Freeman gave the readings depthIf there is one complaint it is Andys claim of innocence It needs to be shown early on during the trial Instead we derived mostly from Andys demeanor It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning When Tommy Gil Bellows tells the story he should include one detail from the trial like the  bullets That way the audience can get an aha moment Its a minor point and overall this is a good prison fable,Positive
Thanx to everybody who helped to put Shawshank back to rank  in the top  in front of LotR where it belongs Ive seen this movie about  times and I never get tired of it Thats what makes a movie the best The first  in the top  are where they belong The  LotRmovies should be out of the top  They should create a category for special effects Put them on top there But for a great movie it need a lot more then effects The story of Shawshank is absolutely great The actors did their best Its still a shame that this great movie didnt got a single Oscar It could have win the best picture in most years against all winners,Positive
Emotion hope and justice all blend perfectly in this film Quite simply no other film comes close to this one in regards to screenplay casting and plot development No spoilers here  just a comment on a movie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings Morgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime Everything else comes together in perfect harmony This movie came out the same year as Forrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture  Forrest Gump is a great picture but this one really deserved the cake Tim Robbins is AMAZING as Andy and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could only hope to see assembled again This is one of those rare occasions where the movie actually surpasses the book for drama suspense and flow If you havent seen this film please do yourself the favour and watch it I know you will not be disappointedGet busy livin,Positive
Its very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days I like the story and its conceptA thumping good ode to friendship hope wit wiles and wisdom brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since The Crying Game The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting not to mention Oscarworthy film In  it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire a film magazine The year it came out it was nominated for  academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember Forrest Gump Its the nobull performances that hold back the flood of banalities Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving Some of The Shawshank Redemption comes across as outrageously improbable Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil,Positive
I saw this movie for the first time a year ago In those days I was browsing the IMDb when I saw this movie ranked  in the top  That was very weird for me because I never heard about The Shawshank Redemption before So I decided to go and rent it immediately After watching the movie I was positively surprised Definitely this is the best movie Ive ever seen The story the direction and the cast Specially Tim Morgan and Gil Bellows are perfect The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings This movie is a must see Thanks IMDb and all IMDb users for the top  and the wakeup call,Positive
Even though the subject matter is dark I consider this the perfect movie I cant count how many times I have rewatched it but Shawshank always engages me and keeps me captivated like few other films have I admittedly have never read the King short story  Im afraid it will disappoint me  but I probably should One thing I like most about this movie is the friendship portrayed by Freeman and Robbins it seems so natural and sweet I also love that this is a long movie  minutes would not have done it justice I know a lot of younger audiences complain about long movies due to their short attention spans but as I said this movie is perfect as is Please do NOT remake it,Positive
Loved this mivue must see This is a very interesting movie and a must see Action packed and popcorn and chill,Positive
this an incredible film this movie was make feel the happiness this unbelievable years dug in the jail without no body know and abbreviation this is a great movie and this is form a few great movies you will see it in your life and is to be enough the writer was the greatest writer in the world Stephen king Tim Robinson give all he have in this film and Morgan free man he give unforgettable part in his Lief and how was believe the bad and strong officer at the end crying and they take him to punshid him above he did and Tim Robinson pushed the administrator of the jail to suicide after he take all his money this movie i will cant forget it for along time he will be in my memory for ever,Positive
A very very very brilliant film The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as always The script was amazing along with the directing The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart It makes you care about criminals The score is also very goodIts an enthralling piece of cinema and just Amazing Id recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal just look at A Clockwork Orange,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is the BEST movie of all time for many reasons The first reason being that Morgan Freeman did his best acting job and that is saying something Freeman is the greatest actor of all time Secondly Tim Robbins gets so into his part you feel like the story is totally true and you are actually seeing it first hand The supporting actors are wonderful as well Enough about the acting which was second to none but the story was so compelling The audience feels sympathy for the main character and wishes for him to be redeemed in the end its just a feel good story I cannot express this enough GO WATCH THE MOVIE NOW It is awesome and will never be topped,Positive
Amazing movie that every film enthusiast should watch beautifull story characters plot cinematography its an all around perfecvt movie the only downside that i can see is that they spend around  years in the prison and look the same throughout the whole movie but that is just a very small detail that will not tkae you out of the movie and you can enjoyit ver nicely if you dont think about it Morgan freeman portrays a very good side character as in red that is the figure of reason because andy is new in the prison and needs somebody with experience to guide him through his stay behind bars very good movie that everybody should watch regardless of everything this review means nothing is just had to fill  characters take care,Positive
I have written a few reviews on IMDb and Shawshank is one of my favorite movies of all time I dont necessarily think this movie was a  but an easy  for me I am giving it a  because of the negative reviews that I read with saying they gave this movie a  just because others had given it a  As far Im concerned its mine to give if I want to to give every a movie a  which by the way I dont I am just sick of people telling me that a movie cant be great because it was story driven and not character driven maybe I like story driven movies I certainly liked this one So heres another  for you movie snobs will have to eradicate,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life Tim Robbins is really a good actor and thanks to him this movie is such a success Also Morgan Freeman is really brought me the story The story is excellentthe time has just flew with this movie This movie just gets better with every showing Theres no some special effects and that is just greatjust men in prison uniforms talking to each other Everyone must watch this movieThe Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen I do not judge it by its technical merits  I dont really care about that I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best The best movies are ones that touch the soul It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul,Positive
An excellent movie that can surely move you a bit It throws open the question that can we really have prisons which are redemption centers in the true sense At the same time it redefines the word criminal Are the heinous acts committed by administrative authorities justifiable by any means There should be a code of conduct for the authorities and a HOLY PRISON MAINTENANCE BIBLE if any reformation has to take place The movie goes through several touching incidents and may bore you a bit if you rarely sees serious touching movies and are fans of slick scifi thrillers moving at extraordinary pace like Matrix etc However the exceptional acting by lead stars particularly by Morgan Freeman and the picking up of the tempo in the second half will leave you gasping for more After Citizen Kane Casablanca  Godfather it is another classic that will stay in the echelons of the movie rating lists for long There are a few weak points though There was insufficient attention given to some characters and movie portrays just one side of the whole story not remaining fair to the prison authorities And finally if it was told in a nonlinear tale then it would have been much more interesting,Positive
I saw once again last night Shawshank Redemption If I have seen it once I have seen it fifty times and never does it ever get tiring to me Stephen King wrote a story which becomes one of the great classic movies of all time Shawshank is a story of a wronged man who overcomes the injustices of life love and prison to remain the true person he always was Andy although a solitary and enigmatic person finds himself through an injustice which throws him into a quagmire of human refuse In this refuse he finds a few pieces of humanity which lets him know there is hope Red is one of those humans Upon realizing that he is about to fall into the hell of prison obscurity Andy releases himself and escapes from the injustice of his current human existence I use the word EXISTENCE for the whole movie is a work of existential survival This is a movie that NO ONE should miss,Positive
For its subtlety its intelligence and its gorgeous cinematography often overlooked in this film this is one of the finest films ever made Robbins and Freeman are brilliant The rest of the cast flows through the storyline with a poise and cadence that is flawless The story itself is based on a short work by Stephen King but the screenplay is sculpted perfectly and gently into a fulllength film by Frank Darabont A powerful story of one mans journey through a punishment he did not deserve and redemption of soul that lifts the hearts of viewers It reminds us that hope is a good thing maybe the best of things Gentle and supremely smart,Positive
Superb movie Based on a Stephen King short story the story of Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins sent to prison for murdering his wife and her lover In prison he is befriended by Red Redding Morgan Freeman who helps him survive the harsh prison lifeA beautiful moving story Characters are steadily and solidly developed and you feel an empathy for the main characters Direction by Frank Darabont is subtle and perfect Pacing is spot onTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are excellent in the lead roles Freeman got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his effortsWell deserving of all the praise heaped upon it Just a pity it didnt garner any Oscars losing out in the most part to a far inferior movie Forrest Gump,Positive
If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film then it is excellent  because it truly gets you involved in its main character It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and wellacted buddystory at its core It delicatelyand sometimes brutallyjuxtaposes Andy Dufresnes Tim Robbins goodnatured character with the harshness of prison life projecting so much heart in doing soHowever delightful as it is The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches  its only a very safe buddystory A damn good one but still just that So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied because what will it be remembered for Friendship Huh neat I therefore dont think its entirely deserving of being considered the  greatest film of all time on IMDbcomBut moving on and looking past that it is possibly one of my alltime favourite films for the feelings it leaves Sure it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story On top of that it never falls prey to predictable sappiness  probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship It is so wellsewn together by a feelgood narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film,Positive
I remember when i first saw this film my friend kept telling me to watch it as he thought it was brilliant well all good things come to those who wait yes i did something I had never done before or since when i finished watching it i rewound it and watched it again straight afterIt has a perfect cast story and the best ending of any film i have ever seenTo sum up in one word magical,Positive
I have literally just turned off the DVD player after watching this film for the very first and last time after so much hype I thought it was about time I sat all the way through it and did enjoy it but I really dont see what all the fuss is about Yes it is a good film yes it is a good plot However I had guessed the outcome and a few bits within the film before the flashback at the end and therefore for me there were no unexpected twists I wasnt even moved at the end In fact all in all I was a bit disappointed as my friends who have seen it said that they had cried and it was such a brilliant film Am I abnormal I think the green mile was better and I did cry at the end of that Im sorry if I upset any of you who think it is the best film ever but I dont,Positive
Out of the fertile mind of American author Steven King comes the incredible prison story called The Shawshank Redemption It is the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover Sent to the notorious Shawshank Dufresne is subjected to the standard abuses every prisoner faces During the ensuing years however he is further subjected to additional punishment by the Sisters who enjoy torturing what they call fresh fish Still Andy tries to survive each day of his sentence as best he can Being extremely agile at his banking craft he overhears Captain Byron T Hadley Clancy Brown complain of his personal financial problems This single incident allows Andy to take advantage of his dire situation and become useful once again Over the years he becomes friends with fellow convict Ellis Red Redding who is adroitly played by veteran actor Morgan Freeman When warden Samuel Norton Bob Gunton learns of Dufresnes financial ability he immediately takes advantage of it This arrangement presents many financial opportunities for the brutal warden and the meticulous and patience prisoner Both can benefit from the outcome The warden intends to retire richer and Hope is the only benefit Andy ascribes to Be he has he has more talent than the warden suspects With additional characters actors like William Sadler as Heywood Gil Bellows as Tommy Mark Rolston as Bogs and legendary James Whitmore who lends a superior performance as Brooks Hatlen this film is destined as a classic for the enjoyment of every audience ,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen  It is truly one of the most fulfilling movies ever made  There are so many good things about it that it is hard to even come close to mentioning all of them so Ill only mention the one thing I liked the most  I liked the fact that the movie could have ended a couple different times and it still would have been one of the best but for Shawshank that just wasnt good enough It kept going until you felt the ending was so perfect that you truly had to sit back breathless  I love this movie and it will always be one of the best as far as I am concerned  A true classic,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face In fact the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes If there is any drawback to this movie it is that it is a shade too long meaning its often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV Rent this or better yet buy it to get the full thrust of it Definitely on my personal top ,Positive
this film is an award winning achievement i loved it what a fantastic and brilliant together drama and crime movie really really amazing a must see to everyonethe story is about a guy called Andy Dufresne who was sent to prison for a murder that was committed to his wife and Andy goes through prison with hard times and a friend for his time in the shaw shank prison with brilliant ac tining from Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman and Clancy brown throughout the film Tim Robbins was Andy Morgan freeman red and Clancy brown as the guardoverall the whole truth can not be told u will love this film dont spoil this for your self its a brilliant story with friendship and survival  you must get this on DVD trust me its brilliant,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good  or in this case brilliantAlthough the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the s I can easily imagine it being transferred to todays time and standards The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors and writers of course didnt use extreme clichs  theres no black and white painting just numerous shades of grey Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles as are all of the supporting actorsFinally I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking,Positive
As I said in the summary there are too many reviews for this movie and its among the best movies of all time So why I wanted to review it Because this movie touched me so deeply and I found it so great and powerful that I have to say my opinion at all costs This is out of my system now I can go to the reviewTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a masterpiece and only a idiot wouldnt watch it or hate it Everything in this movie is perfect the dialogue is clever and well written with many great lines included also in the narration by Morgan Freeman the cinematography is great the soundtrack is among the best that were ever heard in s movies and the performances are very strong and heartfelt Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give their best performances in their careers Robbins is hard to empathize with at the beginning but more the movie goes on more you come to like him Freeman also narrates the movie and here is suave easy to empathize with and likeable as in all his other movies And also the supporting players in the movie are good including James Whitmore in one of his final roles as Brooks HatlenMy favourite scene apart the tearjerking ending The scene of the inmates listening to the Mozart aria through the speakers So you dont have to like prison dramas for liking this movie Yes its depressing and sad in points  but is also perfectly and cleverly written and acted and deserves all the praises that received A movie that has to be seen at least once and if you dont love it I suggest you to go to a psychiatrist,Positive
I use this movie in my Interpersonal Communication course  The relationship between Red and Andy provides rich examples for my students to look for as they write on important issues of Interpersonal Communication such as the symbolic nature of language powerful and powerless speech posture intimate and social distances territory chronemics various types of listening and self disclosure  Many young students struggle to relate inclassintext examples to their own lives and I use this movie to give the class a common experience to discuss and better understand the foundational elements of Interpersonal Communication  ALWAYS a good experience for my students,Positive
This is indeed one of the best prison dramas Ive ever seen Ive always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesnt let me down here But I cant believe this is so high in the overall list I would place it in the  range myself Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins The Player Short Cuts and Jacobs Ladder are all far better films It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me but since Im not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I cant explain why Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better Maybe its the American Factor what with me being English but the overrating of this film completely baffles me,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie The movie depicts how a four lettered word Hope brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possibleThough the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane just amazing and how he influences his fellow prisoner Red The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of Red is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across This story proves that the king of horrors Stephen King is equally good at any other genre of Story WritingHats off The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring The background score of the movie is excellent Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red respectivelyDidnt watch the moviego grab a DVD and watch it as soon as possible Cant miss a movie like this,Positive
All is perfect  the complexity of the characters the suspense the principals themes like friendship loneliness injustice redemption vengeance freedom The most complete movie that ive ever seen Tim Robbins is great sensitive brilliant in one scene he can feel a thousand of feelings Freeman is very correct and seems to be really Red Gunton Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace Titanic is pure entertainment and received  oscars This movie deserves  oscars because it shows what is really important in life No action more realistic more useful than the other films It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it When i see it again I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinemas industry have In a different way only Star Wars Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact,Positive
This is the best movie robbed of acclaim I dont care what anyone says about Forest Gump This movie is better in almost every category except music and maybe tied for movie of the yearTim Robbins acting is as good if not better than Hanks I always have a problem with the simpleton character getting acting nods as with the white trash and ghetto thug characters I think most of us can all do the Gumpy Slow Hick voice ala Cleatus the Slacked Jawed Yokel SimpsonsI cant quite remember how many Oscars Gump stole from this GEM of a movie but this movie blows me away on almost every level The quite passion the Robbins portrays is surpassed by no one except maybe the Freeman sidekick characterThis movie was of course a short story made into a movie S King i think and because of what it delivers i truly believe it to be the best movie of  and probably one of the top  movies of all time,Positive
What can I say about this movie that hasnt already been said Its a prison movie yes but it is so much more than that First let me divvy out kudos to those who deserve it Stephen King for writing this magnum opus Frank Darabont for his stellar directing Tim Robbins for the job he did and of course Morgan Freeman for knocking the ball out of the park one this movieThis was a movie that could be loved and felt by men and women alike It was about losses and gains hope and despondence injustice and rectitude and definitely about friendship Prison just happened to be the backdrop of this film but it could have easily been anyplace The prison setting played a critical role and was interwoven into the overall story but it wasnt the story The story was so much more and the movie did so well in pulling you in and making you care You couldnt help but loathe the warden and his righthandman You couldnt help but like Andy and Red You couldnt help but want the happy endingAbsolutely Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece It didnt get the awards it deserved but like the Utah Jazz in the late s playing the Bulls Shawshank Redemption faced tough competition Although it is getting its recognition here and it deserves the high praise,Positive
I can watch this film a hundred times and still enjoy it Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors And this must be his best roll ever I thought Tim Robbins was definitely at his best in this film All the prison guards and inmates were really believable The story captures you from the beginning and doesnt let go until the final credits are rolled This is the kind of film that make you think of how many inequities must exist in our prison system that no one ever hears about Of all the the movies of this type the Shawshank Redemtion brings to light how good and evil can exist in every situation And that nothing is black and white But until it effect you its out of sight and out of mind,Positive
I dont like movies about way of life or about a hope In this movie is handled a problem with normal life or with resolution to take a life to own hands A topic of this film is such like Papillon This is not an authentic subject this is not an authentic movie,Positive
Great music superb actors It is a pity that Forrest Gump which I consider another masterpiece  went out the same year and got all the publicity as well as the Oscars It was not fairThe only reason for which I rented this movie two years ago was because of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins But it was a big surprise to see one of the best films ever made  I have seen it  more times since then It is a story of COURAGE PERSEVERANCE TRUE FRIENDSHIP HOPE AND REDEMPTIONITS A MOVIE FOR ALL TIMES A MEMORABLE ONE EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE IT YO WONT REGRET,Positive
My favorite movie ever  These are words that basically describe how I feel about this movie  A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie but this is very entertaining  Tim Robbins The Player IQ stars as Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover  He arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prisons head convicts wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman Driving Miss Daisy Seven  Soon the warden played by Bob Gunton Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil Broken Arrow enlists his help as a banker to help with getting some extra illegal money and other things  It doesnt sound like a great movie but trust me this is the best movie Ive ever seen and everyone I know liked it  Tim Robbins is great in the lead  Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden  William Sadler Solo Die Hard  is solid as a fellow convict  Clancy Brown Starship Troopers Highlander is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards  Finally James Whitmore The Relic and Gil Bellows Snow White A tale of terror give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts  A must see,Positive
A great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some point but One user put it very well when they said that the films essential message of the human spirit conquering all is very uplifting an everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homilyThere are several films that deliver the same message just as well if not better Jim Sheridans In the Name of the Father springs immediately to mind That film has a similar theme to this one wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it but is a much better film IMO Whats even more heartening is that its also trueLike I said Im not dissing the film it IS great From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged Freeman is excellent but then whats new the direction is perfect because its so unobtrusive to the story and the film in general is uplifting I just think its nothing particularly new and it has been done better Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video releaseI gave it an  To me this fact proves that I love the film just not as much as everybody else seems toI think this adaptation is on a par with the short story which was also excellent I honestly cant agree with  on the top  list though Is it just an American overreaction to the movie or is every other nation as awestruck by it Please feel free to email me for discussion on this or anything else for that matter of  I dont think it would make it into my top  filmsAh well lifes all about opinions,Positive
Truly a masterpiece of cinema  I hope this film gets the critical recognition it deserves as the years go by  Almost everyone i have encountered has loved this film  How did it not win oscars galore  Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are simply perfect in what is essentially a love story  A love of hope a love of friendship and a love of life no matter the constraints  I LOVE THIS FILM,Positive
Now I see what everybody was talking about It took me  years to see this in my opinion masterpiece If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are to me the pinnacle of both their careers This film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny Robbins Andy and Freeman Red are a balance of the human spirit Andy is your freedomseeking hope side and Red is your rational pessimistic counterpart Find your equilibrium in The Shawshank Redemption,Positive
The amazing thing about this film is how many people fail to realise that the film is about Red not Andy Its Reds perspective of Andy I only mention it because many people strangely think its told from the perspective of AndyThat common misunderstanding behind a well made film The photography is magical the story is strong the performances are exceptional and the depths of despair and humanity of canvassed well without losing mainstream appealBut that aside there is a strong willingness to overstate this film In the end it is a slightly overdone and there is a bit too much triumph of the human spirit dribble on the side But I dont let that get in the way of what is otherwise a very good film with rewatchabilityHadleys release from prison and letter deserves a spot in cinema history That part was absolutely exceptional,Positive
Grate movie  I like it and its one of the Best movie in historyGrate movie  I like it and its one of the Best movie in historyGrate movie  I like it and its one of the Best movie in history,Positive
A film directed by Frank Darabont Starring Tim Robbins At first I was retissant but when I knew that in this film there was this sublime actor who is Morgan Freeman Anyone who spends time watching TV and watching movies should have seen this movie at least once in their lives It is a great sadness for me to learn that Morgan Freeman did not win the Oscar for this film,Positive
This move is amazing from all the side plots to the mysteries it has it all well shot a great cast and is the best movie I have ever seen feels so real and doesnt feel like it lacks anything and has multiple amazing plot twists and shows  different paths meet at the end at the same place both in peace,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption Classic Prison Break MovieWorth Watching  in IMDB Worth for its Hype and Ratings Fast Paced Movie  IntriguingInteresting Dailogues Pre Climax Scenes were ,Positive
I put off seeing this movie for a whole twentyeight years for the reason that I thought the movie was overrated Today I saw this movie  its a masterpiece Even after almost  years the movie looks fresh it conveys very important human themes and makes you thinkMorgan Freeman is a true example of how an actor should be acting in our yearsFor the sake of this movie are obliged to enter a score of eleven because all the tens that I put are not deserved in front of this movieJoy regret tears I recommend this movie to literally every person on this planet You will definitely not regret it,Positive
WEll I had high hopes for this movie  But it fell way short  I was hoping it would keep me guessing but this movie was easy to predict what was going to happen  Though I did think the acting was good by both main starsJason,Positive
One of the best movies ever made I have watched this movie at least a  times Very inspiring,Positive
As a younger viewer who wasnt born when the movie released I can by heart say that movieproductions has gone downhill Im not pointing out that all movies we produce today are bad but that in  years of evolving in technology and having good actors writers etc No movies would stand a chance to being as good as this was This movie shows the true art of directing and storytellingIts a kind of movie that got me thinking learning and at the same time connect emotionally with the charactersI pat myself on the back for going on IMDB and hitting the top rated movies of all time If I didnt I wouldnt have had the chance to view this masterpiece,Positive
Fear can hold you prisoner Hope can set you free A strong man can save himself A great man can save another,Positive
The first time i read about this movie I was sure that this movie is overrated But after seeing him I am sure that this movie is underrated It is the best movie ever It is about hope passion love and friendship I do not think that Hollywood can produce an other movie like that it one in century The acting was GENIUS The script was the best ever The director was a maestro A lot of NovelMoivis not good as the novel I did not read Stephen Kings Novel but I am sure that the movie is much better believe me if you saw the movie you will not be able to forget it Believe me when I say that you will not able to talk after seeing the movie at least for  minutes and the first thing you will say Why this sons of bitches did not give it Best Motion Picture Well Forrest Gump won it  and I love this movie but believe they do not deserve it See the movie I am sure that this will change your view to the future to the hope and to the friendship,Positive
Watched it multiple times and I love it every single time great ensemble and the story is something that is worth noting The director and writer created something very beautiful that every generation should watch We need this tyoe of films more that truly awakens our senses and provides clear distinction in the world of arts,Positive
The best movie I saw until I think the likelihood of making a movie like this is very small,Positive
Kind of movie that makes you feel the art of movie making should never die Its the living soul of what we humans would leave after were gone Absolute genius on behalf of all the people involved in its making They have and will keep this art alive through this masterpiece and inspire generations to come  Stars ,Positive
I dont want to offend anyone some of you actually seem quite intelligent but listen up If a movie is on the on top  list in this case second from top it simply states that this film is the second best liked film in the IMDB world You cant argue that it dont deserve it just because it arent as creative innovative artistic or influential as many other films are THE SECOND BEST LIKED Its a fact Swallow the truthMovie lovers as opposed to the general movie enjoyer have like most disciples of art a much more developed or trained mind when it comes down to their field of obsession and will choose accordingly You cant expect your classmates to love jazz prog rock and classical music just because you do Shawshank Redemtion is obviously generaly an enormously likeable movie and even some of the most artsy people people I know accept it as valid and enjoyable entertainment In my book it rates a solid  Its indeed along with Back to the future that ranks high much because it hit me so hard in my early youth my favourite mainstream movie of all timeFJL from Norway,Positive
This movie is a mystery to me I couldnt find anything exceptional on it Its another HBO stuff without any aesthetic achievement and Its absolutely conformist But there is a fact people love it I want to be fair the movie is OK but people put it in the same place than The Godfather Maybe Im wrong but its not the best picture of all the times not even the best prison picture of all the times Now Im remembering Cool Hand Luke or American Me they are stronger and wiser Butpeople has the last word,Positive
After seeing this movie I could not notice to be misled by the IMDB rating The movie is nice even good but no way it should receive a The movie could easily have been produced by Disney strong moral  a happy ending Sure there are strong points The scene of the old man who have been imprisoned for almost his whole life is very well placed and Tim Robbins performance is good but the story itself does not leave anything behind  out of  Thats all there is to it,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is an absolute masterpiece that effortlessly weaves together themes of hope friendship and the enduring human spirit With impeccable performances from its cast particularly Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman the film transports you into the gritty world of prison life while also touching your heart with its poignant storytelling The expertly crafted plot rich character development and unexpected twists make it a timeless classic that leaves an indelible mark on anyone fortunate enough to watch it The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic gem Its powerful portrayal of hope friendship and resilience along with standout performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman creates an unforgettable experience The films masterful storytelling character growth and surprising turns make it an enduring classic A mustwatch that tugs at your heart and mind,Positive
If theres one movie Id recommend to anyone its The Shawshank Redemption This film is the perfect example of storytelling done right Its emotional gripping and leaves you thinking about it long after the credits roll Honestly its a solid  in my bookThe story revolves around Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins a banker who is wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife What follows is a tale of resilience friendship and hope in the bleakest of circumstances Morgan Freeman as Red the narrator and Andys closest friend in Shawshank delivers one of the most iconic performances ever His voice alone could carry the entire movie but paired with his acting its pure goldWhat really sets this film apart is its pacing and attention to detail Every scene feels purposeful and the way the plot unfolds keeps you hooked The bond between Andy and Red is so welldeveloped that you feel their highs and lows as if they were your own And the ending Its one of the most satisfying conclusions ever a perfect payoff for the journey youve just been taken onBeyond the incredible acting and plot the film has a deeper message about the power of hope and perseverance It shows how even in the darkest times the human spirit can shine through The dialogue is unforgettable who doesnt love the Get busy living or get busy dying line and the cinematography is stunning especially considering it was made in the sIf you havent watched it yet do yourself a favor and make it your next movie night pick Its not just a film its an experience,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best films Ive ever seen The story is powerful emotional and full of hope The acting is outstanding  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make every scene feel real and meaningful Its a movie that stays in your mind long after it ends For me its a perfect,Positive
Ive lost count of the number of times It has to be one of the best movies ever made It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors beforeIs this the greatest film of all time IMDb would have you believe so Despite being a box office flop that barely recouped its budget the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting story and realism It has since been successful on cable television VHS DVD and BlurayAnd it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year Now twenty years old the film has not aged a day and instead seems to be getting better This is Tim Robbins best role and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan FreemanNot everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movieSomething that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action no special effects and no gimmicks  of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the endFor me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it no matter how many times I have seen it,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is a wellmade respectful film with strong performances and a meaningful message about hope I understand why many people like it However I did not feel the overwhelming emotional impact that its reputation promises The story is calm slow and carefully told but it never reached the level of intensity people describe as lifechangingWhat honestly hurts the experience is the massive media hype and herd mentality around it When a film is constantly labeled the best movie of all time expectations become unfairly inflated Many viewers seem to repeat this claim because it is socially accepted not because they truly felt it that deeplyIn my view it is a good film not a masterpiece Solid respectful but not extraordinary  is an honest rating for me,Positive
When I seen this movie in Top I could not believe it thought it was a joke It is probably some boring old movie maybe even without colors But I was amazed Similar to Prison Break series just older version of it Adventure Lesson Inspiration Motivation Insight Experience Confidence Emotionsall in one Good ending too It lacks nothing It teaches us to fight for freedom and not just ordinary freedom like from prisons or psych wards but freedom from people diseases poor life anything negative or bad It gives insight into feeling of being released from some institution for those who have not experienced it,Positive
Mostly what can been said has been said This really isnt anywhere near he greatest movie ever made For heavens sake its a competent genre flick that runs a little too long but contains a couple of wellturned performances from the leads Tim Robbins incidentally is way better in Mystic River Down by Law and Birdman of Alcatraz are both significantly more interesting and original prison movies than this one Cool Hand Luke is obviously the greatest prison film of all time Shawshank is soso Think about it was there a moment a second a single plot turn in that film you didnt know was coming When the young guy goes out for his little conference with the warden did you not think come on guy havent you seen any movies Predictability is satisfying I suppose in its way but give me originality and genuine passion every time Shawshank has neither of those attributes Sorry to everyone who cries every time they see it Youve been had,Positive
A fair number of the movies that rank high on this sites top  all time list also share a parallel life as literature so lets start thereThe book Rita Hayworth etc is the best of the Different Seasons tetralogy King adhered to the first person perspective which is a challenge the narrator can only know what comes into his range of perception You as the reader have to decide if you trust him and so on King wrote this in the early handtomouth period of his existence  and what do we have A prisoner who persistently writes to his benefactors for more fundingDarabont didnt have the skill necessary to really offer anything of artistic value here Were stuck with borrowings parts of Convict  Gilda Brubaker Birdman of Alcatraz musically the Marriage of Figaro aria  its actually not a bad bit of selfreference Its the only good visual part here and even that is smothered by the narration literarily Dumas Monte CristoThe book does a good job of playing with the readers expectations and using irony Theres no preaching And it ends far more intelligently than this does the denouement here seems to belong in a different movie altogetherThis isnt a bad movie considering the obscene amount of money invested in these things its hard to find a truly bad movie any more  one with no cinematic value at all  that wasnt the case    years ago But theres no way I can love it It just isnt the sort of movie that resonates with me because the story is just there with no life of its own,Positive
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight and the Sisters let him beWe know how all that turned out Shawshank Didnt do as well at the movies but wow on the dvd sales And after this many years it still holds over  on Imbd  ImpressiveI wish there was little more substance for the ending  like where was Red going to live  With Andy Would have been nice to see the outcome of the guardThe movie was was it was and I could watch it every time its on tv  Tim was with Susan S for over  years but never married  Dang that is somethingGet busy living ,Positive
This is a fabulous life affirming film with Tim Robbins giving a majestic performance in the lead role as Andy Dufresne a man serving a life sentence in an horrific penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover Its based on a Stephen King novel and the tale is told in part by one of the best uses of narration in cinema history in the form of Morgan Freemans fellow prisoner Red who charts Andys efforts to combat the harsh regime of the sinister Warden Norton deftly played by Bob Gunton Its an engrossing tale that stays long in the memory ultimately as a celebration of humanity and the strength of the human spirit against impossible odds A lovely performance too from James Whitmore as old time prisoner Brooks,Positive
Not for a reason But for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories Its themes the tension the moral questions the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation are bones of a splendid film A film who reminds more than presents Values roots of justice beauty of original source the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer Short  a film who must see,Positive
The shawshank redemption is the great show to illustrate hoe people according to their ancestry can be enslaved free or conversely in freedom captive shawshank redemption is a great show to depict,Positive
There has never been anything like it before and I dont know if there will again Im not going to say any more about this film it has already been said but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in  He shines when it is his time to go back into the world only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink Stephen Kings story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement,Positive
Dear God where do I even begin This is the most perfect film I have ever seen There was not a single moment that felt drawn out I had been long overdue for a watch of this film and I regret not watching it sooner Ive never finished a film and immediately wanted to watch it again until nowThis film is the story of a man told through the eyes of another man The original Stephen King story was phenomenal and I must say that this film surpasses it Without the source materials limitations on what Red could reveal he had to make assumptions The Shawshank Redemption in my opinion stands as the pinnacle of cinema,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic masterpiece that perfectly captures the essence of hope friendship and resilience The film follows the journey of Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins a banker wrongly convicted of murder as he navigates the harsh realities of Shawshank prison Morgan Freeman delivers an unforgettable performance as Red the seasoned inmate who befriends Andy and narrates the story with depth and emotionWhat makes this film truly exceptional is its storytelling Frank Darabonts direction combined with Stephen Kings powerful source material results in a film that keeps you engaged from start to finish The pacing is perfect the dialogues are thoughtprovoking and the emotional payoff is immense The cinematography and Thomas Newmans hauntingly beautiful score add to the films timeless appealBeyond being a prison drama The Shawshank Redemption is a story about never giving up no matter the odds The climax is one of the most satisfying in film history leaving the audience inspired and deeply moved Its no surprise that this film remains at the top of IMDbs list of greatest movies ever made,Positive
Sure it was a good prison movie and much better than many other movies Ive seen  But this does NOT beat Godfather Star Wars or Casablanca in any way  Watch this if you enjoy good performances and good plot but dont expect a presentday classic ala Forrest Gump,Positive
When I first saw this film I wasnt that Mesmorised but as I thought about it I began to notice its Symbolism The more I thought about it the more I liked it and now it is my second favorite movie Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors of are generation and the thing I love most about him is his voice Tim Robbins is perfect as a quit sincere Andy DufranseThis is one of the best movies ever made and deserves more publicity from critics,Positive
This is just a typical prison yarn with some mawkish sentimenttossed in I really don t understand the fuss I guess some peoplelook for grandeur and prjoect it onto middling palatable materiallike this Thats the only explanation Ive got for the unwarrantedpopularity of this flick Production credits are fine enough as is theacting but it certainly doesnt belong on any repsectable list ofgreatest films of all time,Positive

Frank Darabont directed this superb adaptation of the Stephen King novella that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne a young banker who was wrongfully convicted for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend Upon arrival at Shawshank prison in Maine he keeps to himself mostly causing no trouble though does befriend longtime inmate Red Reddingplayed by Morgan Freeman who teaches him the ropes of prison life though the unwanted attentions of degenerate inmates pushes poor Andy to the edge of despair until his financial skills as a banker prove most useful to both the corrupt Captain of the guardsplayed by Clancy Brown and corrupt wardenplayed by Bob Gunton until Andy hits upon a most clever escape plan Now legendary film that sits atop the IMDb best film list is indeed a worthy filmthough not my pick Still done with remarkable skill on every filmmaking level Could be viewed as an allegory of Christianity but is indeed an uplifting story of friendship and the human spirit Supporting charactersexcept for the one played by James Whitmore arent that appealing but arent intended to be either Perfect ending as well,Positive
Great film Well written with very well developed characters I loved the ending and how it rounded off the story very nicelyControversial opinion however perhaps I expected more from the movie and walked into it expecting the best thing I have ever seen because of the ratings Maybe not knowing how well the movie has been received might have made me enjoy it moreEither way really fantastic film,Positive
This is the best movie ever I have watched a lot of movies and this one is the best of them all The end irks great and it is just so damn good watch the damn movie,Positive
Not much to say that hasnt been said Great acting character development and plot Its the ultimate story of overcoming adversity Movies like this arent made anymore and it is saddening,Positive
I just dont get it Its not that I think this is an awful movie or anything but no Look at the rest of the movies in the top  Does it REALLY stand comparison with the Godfather or Seven Samurai I think not Its a manipulative sentimental Sunday afternoon movie raised above Bstandard by some quality turns by talented actors Nothing more And who cares whether Andy could put the poster back in place or not Its a patently ridiculous escape to begin with I understand that most of the people on this site will have a pop at me for being a snob but the fact is I love Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and other blockbuster movies But if youre looking for a genuinely affecting drama this doesnt cut the mustard Sorry guys but youre all wrong,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is reasonably well written directed acted and filmed Yet in my judgment it is a belowaverage movie It lacks a real plot and while the title promises redemption nobody and nothing is redeemed The characters lack depth and many events are implausibleNo doubt wardens and prison guards can be wicked people But those portrayed in this film are so completely perverse that they become uninteresting Their function is to represent the establishment and authority The audience is meant to identify with Andy Dufresne the main character While innocent of the murders of which he is convicted hes hardly an admirable character and he becomes worse during his imprisonment Hes a clever manipulator who eagerly cooperates in the wardens criminal activities in the hope of profiting from doing sowhich he eventually does The prison also has has a contingent of homosexual rapists who are called not human so as to avoid admitting that their behavior is all too human and very much in need of redemptionThus the films popularity it appeals to our tendency to rationalize our own wickedness by comparing ourselves with moral monsters Unfortunately serving that function does not make a mediocre film great any more than serving sound moralism does,Positive
Few films have achieved the enduring acclaim and emotional depth of The Shawshank Redemption Directed by Frank Darabont and based on a Stephen King novella this  masterpiece is more than just a prison dramaits a profoundly moving exploration of the human spiritAt its core the film revolves around Andy Dufresne played brilliantly by Tim Robbins a banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and Ellis Red Redding Morgan Freeman in one of his most iconic roles a seasoned inmate Through their unlikely friendship the story unfolds with themes of hope redemption and the unyielding pursuit of freedomThe performances are extraordinary Robbins brings quiet dignity and determination to Andy while Freemans narration and portrayal of Red imbue the film with wisdom and warmth The chemistry between the two leads is magnetic anchoring the narrative with authenticity and emotional weightRoger Deakins cinematography captures both the bleakness and beauty of Shawshank prison with memorable shots that linger in the mind Thomas Newmans haunting score underscores every triumph and heartbreak elevating the storytelling to poetic levelsWhat sets The Shawshank Redemption apart is its ability to resonate universally It speaks to the resilience of hope even in the darkest circumstances The poignant finale a triumph of the human spirit leaves audiences inspired and deeply movedAlthough it initially underperformed at the box office The Shawshank Redemption has since become a cultural touchstone Its themes are timeless and its characters feel like old friends Its a film that rewards repeat viewings revealing new layers with each watchIn summary The Shawshank Redemption is not just a filmits an experience A story that reminds us that hope is a good thing maybe the best of things If you havent seen it you owe yourself the gift of this cinematic masterpiece,Positive
Its just perfect movieSubject details and engagementDescribes the struggle of a human being a character who confronts injustice,Positive

Well Ive seen this film more times than I can count and honestly it hits me just as hard every single time Theres a reason this film is considered one of the greatest of all timeAt its heart its a story about hopehope so powerful that it can survive even in the toughest situationsWatching Andy and Red face the hardships of prison life only to somehow hold on to their dignity and dreams is nothing short of inspiringThe way the film uses its setting and characters is incredible No matter how bad things get theres always a way out if you refuse to give upLook at Andys fight against the system and Reds journey from hopelessness to freedom how often do we let lifes struggles hold us back without seeing the bigger picture Sometimes the real prison is not the wall around us  its the limits we put on ourselves,Positive
First when I saw how huge the overall rating  was I wondered why But then I told myself I should give it try and truly it was totally worth it period I miss this kind of movies sush a masterpiece it contain many lessons and significances about our life Im still wondering how this masterpiece didnt win a oscar then I figured out that it is a small thing comparing this movie and if you dont watch it yet then you have miss a big part from your life,Positive
The movie had plot up the wazoo The acting was superb Robbins and Freeman were at their highest in this movie  There were so many emotions flying through it and there was so much about the human mind  It will leave you in awe,Positive
Okay lets say this from the word goShawshank Redmeption might as well be called Fantasy Island visits Alcatraz  Lets just see how many shopworn prison movie cliches the picture has  A corrupt warden   Brutal guards   Homosexual gang attacks at least not in a shower   Innocent man sent to jail has a journey of self discovery   All illiterate convicts speak flawless english and spout witty phrases   No racial tension in fact no blacks with any character except Morgan Freeman doing a version of the kindly butler from a Shirley Temple pictureafter all it appears all he is there for is to be the witty sidekick and supply cigarettes and pictures of scantily clad women   A black man runs the illegal smuggling into the prison   Nobody in jail is bad or even seems like they could be violent they are all a bunch of happy go lucky working class stiffs  I guess this means we should be able to identify with rapists and murderers as they are just like usa chilling thought   Nobody except the hero ever attempts an escape or seems to want to escape  Over use of metaphors such as rain as a metaphor of washing himself clean of his past and putting on a new lifeI am not saying that all prison films have to be a version of Scared Straight but come on this is clearly a fantasy prison and the very unreality of it undercuts anything the movie might be trying to say  The Shawshank Redemption is in this reviewers eye nothing more than another holier than thou morality play packaged as gritty realism all because it is based in a prisonhohum,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is with out a doubt one of the most over rated films of the s  There have been many intriguing prison movies over the years Shawshank is not one of them Instead its sentimental slop served to uplift the souls of the American people  There is never any sense in the film that Tim Robbins character is in true danger  If the film wanted to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker instead of inspiration Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual in the role of wisdom spouting inmate Freemans character is mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all but he is never treated as a typical person Tim Robbins is good but his character is all good while the prison warden is sure evil Everything is black and white  Shawshank has potential to be great but director Frank Darabants obsession with being Frank Capra ruins the film at every turn,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is a true masterpiece and a genius work of cinematic excellence It is a true testament to human will friendship and determination Quite possibly the greatest film ever made The clashing themes of evilness and goodness within the prison system makes this film the compelling and satisfying story it entails,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is more than a filmits therapy for the soul It gently teaches patience resilience and the quiet strength of hope Andy Dufresnes journey through injustice and confinement is both heartbreaking and inspiring Morgan Freemans narration adds a calming reflective layer like a voice guiding you through your own struggles The story doesnt just entertainit heals Every frame reminds you that even in the darkest places light can break through Watching this film is like taking a deep breath after chaos It stays with you offering comfort perspective and above all the belief that hope is never wasted,Positive

Let me just say Im embarrassed it took me until the age of  to watch The Shawshank Redemption This film was released the same year I was born and somehow despite the countless mentions references and praise I kept pushing it off I wish I hadntBecause this isnt just a movie Its twenty movies in one  each scene each character arc each little moment is like its own perfectly crafted short story and together they build to a revelation so powerful it hits like a spiritual awakeningWhat amazes me most is how layered the experience is Its not just about prison Its not just about hope Its about everything friendship injustice solitude dignity the human spirit fear of change and the raw terror of freedom Every character is written with such care and detail even the minor ones  you feel their entire lives in just a glance or a line of dialogueThere are scenes that will break your heart quietly Others that will grip your chest And then there are those rare moments where you realize youre watching something eternal  one of those cinema as therapy kinds of moments that burrow into your soulWatching it now I can only describe it as a long slow beautiful unfolding of truth Its meditative It doesnt rush It lets you live with these people And by the end you dont just understand Andy and Red  you understand something deeper about yourselfI genuinely think this is the kind of film you dont watch you experience And then you carry it with youIf youre like me  if you somehow havent seen this film yet  stop reading this and fix that immediatelyI waited  years I wont stop thinking about it for the rest of my life,Positive
Best movie ever  if youre looking for perfection  this is itFreedom at its best Morgan Freeman its formidableThe Shawshank Redemption is not a depressing story there is a lot of life and humor in it and warmth,Positive
Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freemans Ellis Redding Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen Kings short story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption in the film version its really Raquel Welch not Rita who aids in the ultimate twist On the surface its another prisongenre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden a cruel guard a few homosexuals and a quirky oldtimer who doesnt want his parole However the films emotions run surprisingly deep justice is well served by the conclusion and several of the cast members carve out amazing threedimensional characterizations The finale is pure fantasy however it does provide the audience with the release it needs and Robbins and Freeman are excellent Long involved but engrossing and satisfying Shawshank was not a big hit at the boxoffice but found a devoted following on video and cable  from ,Positive
Sorry folks but can this film really be one of the greatest of all time Entertaining Yes Well acted Erryes  Life affirming No way Realistic Dont make me laughTwenty years or so pass in this film Does anybody get any older Apart from the occasional pair of specs thats it Not an extra wrinkle to be seen What happened to the makeup departmentPeople get beaten to within an inch of their lives One death and one wheelchair case but otherwise just a couple of bruises which disappear rapidlyThe baddies get their just deserts and were all supposed to shout serve them right as we say in England The goodies live happily ever after but we knew that would happen within the first ten minutes The people who think this is a great film probably think Stephen King is a great author Competent and popularyes Greatno PS Who replaced the poster after Was that an oak tree Maybe leaves are a different shape in America,Positive
It is strange that this movie is nd in imdb chart as it is the same old american story where good people win and bad guys died More strange the USA is still the place where this story must sound more false,Positive
Based on ratings by users I can see why this film is rated number  on IMDbA film about Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins who claims he was falsely imprisoned He decides to adjust to life while incarcerated and befriends a number of his fellow inmates including Ellis Boyd Redding Morgan Freeman Andy establishes respect among his cohorts and even the prison guards by doing a number of things in improving life in the prison including expanding a library and helping people do taxes The mens friendships grow over the years as try to find as the IMDb plot puts it solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency This movie is on the longer side being over two hours long However the many elements in this film do not drag making this movie an intriguing and exciting feature The plot and subplots were solid blending together well and the cast of characters gave a strong dramatic and memorable performance There were action humor drama tragedy and hope all mixed in providing you a very entertaining filmThere are far too many aspects of this film to be mentioned all at once in this review Therefore you will have to see and follow this movie for yourself to appreciate it It is certainly worthy of its seven Oscar nominations including Best Picture Forrest Gump won that year A mustsee for anybodyGrade A,Positive

The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare films that transcends time genre and audience Even decades after its release it continues to resonate deeply with viewers across generations Set primarily within the rigid confines of a prison the film explores the human spirit in its most tested and vulnerable state yet it never feels heavy or depressing Instead it is quietly upliftingWhat makes this film exceptional is its storytelling The narrative unfolds patiently allowing the audience to truly connect with the characters and their journeys Rather than relying on dramatic twists or flashy moments the film builds its emotional strength through small meaningful details and powerful conversations Every scene feels purposeful contributing to the overall message without ever feeling rushed or unnecessary,Positive
This movie had everything an amazing movie consists of  a compelling plot a strong bond being built between the characters and a plot twist that will take your breath away Prepare to be moved as you witness a movie which shows the true side of institutionalism at prison  but also where the underdog perseveres against the challenges of life and overcomes hardships The ending will leave you content giving you a newfound sense of fulfillment and an appreciation for your life No matter how many times I watch this movie it always moves me as it did the first time I watched it Truly a masterpiece that needs to be witnessed all around the world,Positive
You could describe The Shawshank Redemption in a number of ways engrossing drama riveting character study topshelf prison movie But its nothing it not a shining example of the power of the indomitable human spirit You root for Andy Dufresne from the very beginning as a man unfairly targeted by fate and you want desperately for him to succeed    somehow Mixed in with all of this is a wellwritten story about friendship and even a little bit of revenge to sweeten the deal As a Stephen King story its a classic and a faithful screen adaptationAnd that cast is impeccable,Positive
Very strong dialogues as well as very suitable actors developing a new style in the field of cinema and a film with very high details Also excellent sound has been included in this film which helps to convey the atmosphere of the film well Apart from this this film is one of the most influential films of the last few decades and also represents hope and aspirations And the best part of the story is the unique dialogues of the film I still hope you enjoy watching this film and see its impact on your mood It really conveys the best feeling It engages a part of your life and gives you a sense of victory,Positive

This movie is good theres no question about that but he nd best ever Thats a bit of a stretch I cant really imagine that all of those people who gave this movie the  and  votes have seen very many other good movies  Sure the story is meaningful and its harsh etc but there are so many movies that are moving and powerful  The fact that Shawshank is  on this list is a reflection of those voting,Positive
This is simply the best film ever made  It just goes to show that you dont need mutlimillion pound special effects and a number one theme tune to make a good film,Positive
This film should barely scratch out a spot in the top  let alone be one of the top ranked films of all time It is rather dull extraordinarily predictable and filled with clichs This is not even the best prison film let alone  among all films Cool Hand Luke or Papillon anyone Id give it a  Freeman  Co do not disappoint but someone needs to bring down this bloated rating The film is little more than a rehashing of conventional sentimentalism painted in prison stripes and sold in bulk to a apparently gullible audience Help bring this down to a reasonable position so that more deserving films can attain their proper recognition,Positive
This movie is so complete Some say its too long those people are wrong Every scene matters every scene is developing the story and the story it tells is beautiful The filmmakers tell that story in the perfect way It is hard to find something wrong with this film I never got bored from start to finish All the actors were believable and gave great performances Truly one of the best films of all time,Positive

Indeed This is the best movie in history An outclass script And beautiful narration,Positive
Enough has been said of this masterpiece so Ill keep my review succinct This truly is my favorite movie of alltime because no matter how many times I see it I still get the genuine feeling of hope the film has delivered since the first time I saw it Everything about this movie is perfect from the cinematography to the acting the casting the writingeverything Its a fantastic example of the power of hope and the true nature of the human spirit When you watch it you just know that every scene is classic so many moments will be remembered forever in film history If anything it just keep getting better with each time I see it I will continue to enjoy this film for the rest of my life,Positive
This movie is a fine way to spend  minutes but is by no means a movie of the first rank The script is far too simplistic clichridden and predictable The characters are far too good guybad guy dualistic and for a story purporting to take place over the course of  years there is remarkably little character development And just about every really evil character gets his comeuppance whereas the people were supposed to be rooting for end up in clover HmmmmAmong prison movies Cool Hand Luke is bettermore realistic and without the obligatory Hollywood feelgood ending Runaway Train and Papillon are also very good certainly more interesting Among inspirational movies last years October Sky is a better betIn a nutshell tremendously overrated but certainly worth seeing,Positive
This movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen Morgan Freeman gives an unbelievable performance in this work The direction of it is exquisite and gives much to Tim Robbins character I know he is a good actor but the direction gives so much more to him  The soundrack is unparalleled and the story is exquisite thanks to Stephen King  I have seen many greats Citizen Kane The Godfather Cuckoos Nest The Deer Hunter Apocalypse Nowetc This movie is fantastic and the fact it didnt win or even get nominated for an Oscar is the reason I dont pay attention to the Oscars anymore This movie is fantastic and an artistic triumph I have no respect for the Academy for ignoring this flick,Positive
This Movie Really from true story this is old movie but so nice im so glad with the producer of this movie D,Positive
It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison but The Shawshank Redemption creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family I wont spend much word on this movie to justify how classic movie is this Worth a watch many times,Positive
I am pretty sure I have watched it more than  times now  and I will watch it a  times more shared the experience of this work of art and recommended it to many many people because i felt it will be selfish to keep it to myself The movie is ageless timeless and pure it sticks with you forever The shawshank redemption isnt just a movie it is a feeling,Positive
Shawshank is undeniably one of the greatest films of alltime The lessons is has the feelings you get and what you get out of it is more than most movies will ever do The acting is spot on the story the struggle the overcome it all wraps Shawshank into a bubble by itself You will be forever changed by watching this movie If youve yet to see it its an absolute must watch If you have seen it watch it again for the th time it gets better,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is not just a filmits an experience that quietly settles into your soul and stays there long after the final frame A perfect  feels less like a rating and more like an acknowledgement of cinematic greatnessThe outofthisworld performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the beating heart of this masterpiece Tim Robbins brings Andy Dufresne to life with remarkable restrainthis calm exterior masking resilience intelligence and an unbreakable spirit Every glance every silence speaks volumes making his journey profoundly moving without ever being melodramaticMorgan Freeman on the other hand delivers one of the most iconic performances in film history as Red His narration feels like wisdom passed down through generations and his acting is layered with warmth regret hope and quiet redemption Red doesnt just tell the storyhe becomes the emotional bridge between the audience and Shawshanks wallsWhat truly elevates the film is how gently it explores hope friendship and freedom It never rushes never forces emotionyet somehow leaves you deeply moved inspired and reflective Every rewatch feels rewarding revealing new nuances and deeper meaningA flawless story unforgettable characters and performances that define acting excellenceThe Shawshank Redemption earns its  not by spectacle but by soul,Positive
Simply wonderfulThis is without a doubt the greatest film ever Incredible story acting cinematography soundtrack and a genuinely satisfying ending But more importantly it speaks to people on a deeper level Thats the reason that stands the test of time A message of hope and perseverance Fantastic,Positive
Good very good its a good and i aconselho a ver fdsafsadfdsafdsaf,Positive
This is quite far from being the best movie of all time The characters are black and white in true blockbuster tradition Everybody is either all good or all evil and do not at all feel real The plot is unoriginal although it has a surprise ending thats hardly original scriptwriting The film is extremely clicheridden and I dont recommend it to anyone who appreciate truly great films like the three colors trilogy etc,Positive
Have watched this in so many coutries around the world on my travels Had it on VHS then DVD then Blu Ray and now on my iPad I still watch it when it comes on TV If you havent seen it watch it you will not regret itThe characters are amazing the story realistic and it draws you in As it goes over a  year period it is mazing how the characters age properly the trends change with posters music etc even if there is a slight mistake with one of the albums not being available for another  years after the period shown You laugh you cry and you will cheer for the guys in the jail For Andy doing that stretch when youre really innocentwell,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece of storytelling acting and emotion The film perfectly balances hope patience and friendship keeping viewers deeply engaged from start to finish Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver unforgettable performances making every scene impactfulThe pacing is slow at times but intentional allowing the story and characters to develop naturally Emotional moments hit hard without feeling forced and the ending is deeply satisfyingA mustwatch for anyone who loves strong storytelling memorable characters and timeless life lessons,Positive
Few things you probably already know about The Shawshank Redemption it was nominated for  Oscars yet failed to win any it failed at the box office and it is one of the best movie ever madeI felt mesmerized watching this movie and I believe everyone who has watched it must have felt the same A perfect adaptation of Stephen Kings novel Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption this movie stays faithful to the plot of the novella with very minor alterations Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have given stellar performances Freemans eloquent narration throughout the film provides the description of the events happening over the prison and his friendship with Andy Dufresne over a number of years from his characters perspective The main themes of the movie hope selfworth integrity and friendship are beautifully interlocked with the prisondrama The climate of Shawshank State Penitentiary is painted gray and dull to amplify the intensity of every event The depiction of institutionalized life and emotions of the prisoners who arent only trapped inside Shawshank physically but psychologically as well are very precise The character of Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins displays extraordinary courage and selfworth in the hopeless walls of Shawshank prison The climax is intricately woven with poetic justice This film is Frank Darabonts Magnum Opus A well deserved  on IMDbs Top ,Positive
Greetings from LithuaniaIt is very hard to call The Shawshank Redemption  a masterpiece but it is a definitely one of the most inspiring and beautifully crafted picture off all time That said i wont going into details as plot and everything about this movie is so well known To simply put this is a story of two men in prison sentenced to life time and their journey to redemption Seeing this movie   times in my life i can say that when some time passes you kinda feel a need to rewatch it again because this movie is like a journey itself with characters drawn so sharply that we do care about them and the outcome is one of the most powerful and hope inspiring there is I brake every single time when watching sequence when Brooks gets out of prison and the whole sequence of living free  it is a powerful film making so say the leastOverall No at IMDb Top  says a lot  this is a movie that stays with you and inspires you not to lose hope It is flawlessly paced  at running time  h  min it never drags  it should be studied at film making universities HOW to create a film with no women characters when action takes place inside the prison and there isnt mainstream action at all Good things never get old and The Shawshank Redemption is one the fainest examples,Positive
Every time they play it on the tv I watch it as if its my first time watching it Amazing movie with the best happy end ever Theres a timeless quality to this film that makes each viewing feel fresh and emotionally resonant Its an amazing movie with what I consider the best happy ending ever They truly dont make movies like this todayfilms that are both deeply moving and profoundly upliftingWhat makes The Shawshank Redemption so remarkable is its layered storytelling and the way it explores the resilience of the human spirit The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne a banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two life terms at Shawshank State Prison Despite the harsh realities of prison lifeincluding violence corruption and despairAndy never loses hope His quiet strength and unwavering belief in justice become a beacon not only for himself but also for those around him especially his friend Red played masterfully by Morgan FreemanThe friendship between Andy and Red is the heart of the film Their bond forged over decades is a testament to the power of human connection even in the bleakest circumstances Reds narration provides insight and warmth guiding us through the years at Shawshank and revealing how hope can survive even behind bars The performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are nothing short of extraordinary bringing depth and authenticity to their characters Critics have praised their nobull performances and the genuine chemistry that holds the film together creating something undeniably powerful and moving,Positive
One of the greatest movies of all time The movie encapsulates all the values that give hope patience and motivates us all to never give up The characters their performances is so unique The musical score is by one of my all time favourite composer Thomas Newman Timeless Masterpiece Must have Must Watch  Must Share,Positive
One of the best films of all time A source of inspiration and emotion A reminder that no matter how dire life is hope always survives,Positive
This bloated and soggy piece of work is so far from earning a number  spot on the IMDb that I have to imagine that Stephen King has bought votes for it Trite  mawkish shallow unconvincing ugly How much more can I say about its awfulness Morgan Freeman is tolerable Tim Robbins is not There is a romantic glow to the cinematography that is really inappropriate if the main characters are heterosexual If they arent there is an unexplored subtext poisoning the base of the movie There is nothing else about this movie that makes a lick of sense emotional dramatic logical racial penological Rips off the Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and cheapens and flattens them Its appeal escapes me utterly For the love of God sink this film,Positive
This particular movie is the absolute best ever and should be rated  of all timesWith all the pages of comments that have been posted on this site I will not even attempt to add to the eloquence of the previous commentsI have noticed that many people have posted that they did not see this movie in the theaters I would not even watch the movie on VHS as my wife and children begged me to take a look at the filmThe title did not appeal to me and I did not understand the title I dont particularly like any prison movies I just would not watch the film and I was probably watching ten movies per week at that timeI finally watched when one night I could find nothing appealing in the video store From that moment in  Ive probably watched the movie about  times per year for the last eight yearsPeople refer to all the classics as being such masterpieces but I disagree Citizen Kane Some Like It Hot African Queen Casablanca Godfather and all the others can not compete with anything about this movie,Positive
Let me tell you a little story I am  years old and consider myself an avid movie buff From Braveheart to American History X to Pulp Fiction to Schindlers List to The Matrix I thoroughly enjoy watching and talking about great movies After being desensitized by the poor gorefest known as Hostel I came home and watched this movie with some friends Let me tell you that this is one of two movies I can think of that has made me tear up I dont do it often and I certainly wasnt expecting to tonight But the Shawshank Redemption tantalizes your mind and touches your soul It is a triumph of motion picture and tonight became of of my top five favorite movies of all time Please go see this in its entirety if you have not,Positive
The Count of Monte Cristo isnt a very good book and has spawned a few pretty poor films but its the ideas which make it an enduring story Now whether Stephen King was consciously inspired by Dumass Dumasss book when writing the original short story I dont know  what I do know is that Frank Darabont took a dour typically coarselydetailed potboiler and evolved it into something special The big step for me was that having taken an interesting idea and made it good Darabont then found an ensemble cast and a cinematographer who could make it sing I dont think theres a dull line of dialogue in the movie and barely a camera shot either out of place or wasted Why it is that equally talented filmmakers can spend millions and produce the kind of mindless gibberish which actually wins Oscars like Braveheart did in the year Shawshank Redemption was nominated Ill truly never fathom Maybe there should be another way of formally recognising talent wait ten years then take a vote  that way the mindless and the popular will have time to find their level and whats left is worth remembering,Positive
I know Best Movie Ever sounds like such a clich a phrase used to death Many people use it on movies which really do not deserve to be called the best movie ever I believe that the phrase  Best Movie Ever should be reserved for one movie only The Shawshank Redemption Not so long ago on IMDb The Shawshank Redemption was ranked nd This naturally compelled me to buy it and then i discovered what makes up a truly great movieSimple plot wonderfully acted and directedSince watching The Shawshank Redemption i have been preaching to all my friends to watch it And here i must do the same It is ranked  on IMDb for a reason It is the best ever It will move you You will love it If you havent seen it watch it,Positive
Its an emotional manipulation for dummies type of film with boring direction and cardboard characters Nice performances by the actors though some great moments but nothing outside the Hallmark meets Stephen King meets Prison feel of the entire movieI saw it one and a half times and would see it again only if I got paid for the troubleSimilarly I hated The Green Mile only later did I find out its the work of DarabontMy recommendation Skip this and go see OZ again,Positive
Good cast Good story The performances were excellent and there was both ample food for thought and some very good scenes Didnt hurt that im a big Morgan Freeman fan Always top notchOn the other hand overall the whole film was far too unpleasant preachy and downright repugnant to be terribly enjoyable When the payoff at the end finally arrived it just wasnt grand enough to overcome the feeling id just crawled through the sewerAnd for this to be the  film on IMDb actually second but same score as  and with more votes among far superior films like The Godfather Schindlers List Lord of the Rings and Casablanca is ludicrous This would never even have entered the remotest regions of my mind if somebody had asked me to name some really great films,Positive
By far Shawshank was the best film of  But look who it was up against at the OscarsForrest Gump Its not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be in fact it was good But it was also a very hyped movie The public ate it up and they also got too much of it That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry I wish the Oscars didnt do this all the time They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes It was robbed But that doesnt make it any less of a film Its a triumph of filmmaking Robbins and Freeman are excellent The character Brooks is terrific and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton Go rent this movie if its the last thing you do The ending is one of the most satisfying in movie history,Positive
I will always remember the night I watched this movie for the first time I was yearsold and my dad and I were pretty bored late on a school night So naturally I say to my father Dad I think its time to watch Shawshank I almost regret watching it It is that good Its like nothing I ever see in my lifetime can ever compare to the emotional roller coaster that The Shawshank Redemption takes you onFirst question I usually ask people when discussing films is So have you seen Shawshank No matter what their reply is I am happy with the outcome because if they say no then they are yet to see the greatest movie of all time If they say yes I have something to talk to them about for the next  minutesYou probably still wont believe me when I tell you that this is the greatest film you will ever see Its that good that I actually told one of my friends not to watch it until she was on her deathbed Then she will see this movie without ever having to compare anything else to it Now when I see a movie all I think is Ive already seen the bestNow actually getting onto maybe even reviewing this masterpiece not that any summary of the plot could ever do it justice So all I will say is this I have never heard anyone give this movie a bad review Do yourself a favour and dont even bother to finish reading this Just go and watch it,Positive
simply the best movie ever made this movie embraces the philosophy that justice will be done karma is heard and that goodness will rule above anything in this world Andy and reds friendship is a strong unique bond founded under the harshest of circumstances In prison they each serve their time for situations they got themselves into but certainly didnt form them as men  or messed with their true character Andy has no choice but to try and accept his fate that he will be in Shawshank forever  and on the surface he rises to the occasion by doing the paperwork for the sadistic warden who treats Andy like the lowest of the low In the meantime Reds parole is continuously declined and they both have to readjust even though their life in prison sometimes offers them glimpses of hope and of freedom Will the time really come and if yesare they ready for it,Positive
This film ranks second among my all time favourites The only reason it does not hold that coveted first place spot is that I am obsessed with Monty Pythons The Holy Grail Shawshank is a beautifully crafted film with one of the best endings I have ever seen even though in a way it is not entirely unexpected It is particularly enlivened by the presence of Morgan Freeman who should have won an Oscar for his voiceovers alone In a word Exceptional,Positive
This film is love it or hate it flawless I find myself unable to pick out any one element of this movie that was poorly executed or inconsistent The Director Frank Darabont despite his muchlessthanimpressive filmography successfully animates every scene and character in living detail Whats more is the life and detail he brought to his screenplayOriginally published under Richard Bachman Stephen Kings oncepseudonym Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption is one of the most miserable short stories ever hacked out by any desperately uninspired fiction author in history The book makes no attempt to build or define characters background or story progression It basically apexes around the one scene in the prison theatre where the writer clumsily tries to convey the point of the book as hopeless as a mans situation is his dreams and fantasies live on After Kings catharsis he seemingly looses any real interest in his story and apathetically caps it off several pages laterFrank Darabont not only masterfully directed this film but deserves much more credit for crafting  of this movie purely from his own imagination and being able to construct a very tangible plot line from complete tripe Credit where credits due Stephen King doesnt even deserve royalties,Positive
This movie was far ahead of its time It had the best picture soundtrack brilliant acting decriptive characters masterful storyline as in example illustrated the ideal prison life to the bone  and was first of its kind to come out with a unbelivableshocking ending If you havent watched this movie yet you are depriving your eyes from the amazing it craves The ending is so beautiful one cant dare to imagine,Positive
This movie offers less in terms of plot twists character development and acting than what I think people realise Morgan Freeman delivers a characteristically mundane performance and the other characters dance forgettably around himThere are few to no memorable quotes and even less action and the only real twist at the end could be the most overrated twist of all timeI only watched this after it was deemed a must by most of my close peers and fellow movie critics only to be gravely disappointed with their judgments If this movie has taught me anything it is that IMDb ratings mean jack and that people are in general conformist in nature  they rate movies highly if their fellow humans talk it up Who could forget the terrible acting and the sexual innuendos in this movie The only reason that the director put that in there was to make it feel more prison like but for me it felt as if he was trying to plug a bathtub with a million holes A tub full of vomit to begin withFrankly I do not care if this is an unpopular view And neither should you Popularity is a reflection of the current state of societys desires nothing more,Positive
One of the best films of all times They dont make them like they use to and we slowly forget what art is,Positive
Even though this movie is over  years old the message about friendship and not ever giving up will be relevant forever The lessons that the main characters teach us in the face of adversity are timeless This is also one movie that does not get old and I have watched Shawshank many times Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were spectacular in their performances They teach lessons that are extremely memorable and have quotes that you will never forget The one quote in the film that is a standout is Get busy living or get busy dying Who would not feel the impact of that quote This is one movie you have to have in your library and I am not one that usually buys DVDs This is a MUST SEE Dont miss this one and also keep a box of tissues nearby,Positive
th review Superb Great Masterpiece Unforgettable Excellent Brilliant No no  no I have been thinking for months to find a word that can describe the film Nothings found yet and  to be honest I think nothing will be found forever The movie cant be expressed by words Words are unable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this masterpiece But Im hopeful to be able one day to express my feelings about it because hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies When it come to the Shawshank Redemption I prefer to remain silent because silence is full of unspoken words,Positive
There are few movies that capture and identify with the American male spirit Shawshank is one of those movies I dont care what anyones take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal this movie is moving There are three movies in my opinion that every man or developing man should watch Shawshank Redemption Dancing With Wolves and Brave Heart Unless you are a total pansy these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality Andy Dufrane is the person in us Red is the person we want to be Aside from the being in prison the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation,Positive
"The shock is the main thing in the movie three shocks  and the teller sound of Morgan Freeman make you melt in it
Thank you too much Hollywood for making this major movie
God bless you all",Positive
An analysis of prison lifeand of what hope can be in a prisonFrank Darabonts first film is one of the best ever  Wellwritten and wellacted the story of the development of friendship between Red and Andy is charming endearing poignant  Nothing about this movie is overwrought or extraneousits simply extraordinary drama,Positive
The storys quite plain the acting is OK but nothing really over the top even though the soundtrack the quality of the shots and the atmosphere really stood out I think its for obvious sentimental reasons that people like this movie The good guy takes a lot of crap but wins in the end because hes smart There are way better movies than this one and I really cant understand why so many people rate it   equals perfection and very few pieces of art come close to it I think  is a very high rating and this movie probably doesnt deserve more than an  maximum The masses dont necessarily appreciate subtle art and want to be entertained thats what the movie industry is about Still this movie was quite gay Way too much emo and way to predictable,Positive
Many of the most powerful stories are the soulful ones that teach us not to despair not to be swamped by sorrow They remind us that  hope is a precious and buoyant emotion that can give our lives substance and meaning Most people who see this movie for the first time are not going to appreciate it completely I feel that it is quite possible the best movie ever made Some may be more entertaining like say Indian Jones and the last Crusade but none as compelling The movie shows a world of different emotions mainly through its two main characters Red and Andy The acting is incredible The message is stronger than that of most any movie and is stated very clearly  Hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever does After being drained by the sad events that occur in the movie the ending uplifts and thoroughly fulfills the gap that it could leave you withI believe that one reason that this movie is under appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times At first viewing it is the story of Andy and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances However this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks Because of Andy Red can find different path of freedom that is lit by hope No matter what circumstances you live in dont forget that hope is the best thing in the world And you will have courage to struggle to forward and to live better in the world,Positive
It is not uncommon to hire people to write reviews on social networks that should appear to be by independent contributors Thats why i had to laugh when i saw The Shawshank Redemption being the best rated movie on IMDb But since there would be little sense in making such an effort to generate more than a million votes and almost three thousand reviews for a movie made in  i assume this is genuineIn any case based on Stephen Kings novella The Shawshank Redemption was an alright prison movie to watch However it displays what i see as typical for Kings work When hes writing science fiction fantasy or horror it all sits well But when he writes anything that should mirror reality it simply feels fake in the same way as wearing a cotton shirt and the one made of synthetics feels different The events might have been based on actual events but i havent been convincedObviously when you make any kind of list there will always be a first place On IMDb it is currently being taken by The Shawshank Redemption,Positive
Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins bides his time during twenty years imprisonment for the murder of his wife in this adaptation of a Stephen King story And being Stephen King the setting is once again Maine though youll find Shawshank State Prison in Ohio Its the forbiddingly Gothic Mansfield Reformatory  Reformatory Road Mansfield on US Route  about  miles southwest of ClevelandBuilt between  and  the reformatory remained in operation until  and was scheduled for demolition when the film was made In fact much of the prison yard has now gone to make room for the adjacent Richland Correctional Institution but the striking Administration Building lives on as a tourist attraction Find it just north of downtown Mansfield off South Olivesburg Road,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption based on the fantastic Stephen King novel is a moving story about Andy Dufresne an innocent man charged with the murder of his wife and her lover who is sentenced to  years in prison and fights hard to survive but in prison he forms a rare and close friendship with fellow inmate Ellis Red Redding The film more or less focuses on the friendship between Andy and Red played beautifully by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman Morgans deep and moving voice was perfect to describe the closeness of his friendship with Andy The film had a great happy ending where Andy escaped from the prison after serving almost  years he also managed to expose the prison as there was murder and corruption going on there Andy moves to a beautiful island abroad and when Red is paroled after serving  years in prison he is reunited with Andy it was a great ending to a beautiful movie,Positive
As I was saying just amazing it makes you laugh cry and even shout,Positive
Filmmakers that plan to make use of Stephen Kings writings in the future need to pull an Orson Welles and watch this about  times before they get into it And read the short story just as many times This is the best transfer of a Stephen King story Ive ever seen I would give it to Kubricks The Shining but its more like Kubrick took the story idea and did his own movie on it In other words while its a classic its not that great of an adaption Andy Dufresne is wrongly imprisoned for murdering his philanderous wife and while in prison befriends a prisoner named Red who is great at getting outside products to the inmates The message of the film is strong and clear  Hope Hope Hope is a beautiful thing The film is about triumph About friendship Its also about some knockout acting Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at the top of their game A Must see Especially if you are a fan of Stephen Kings short story,Positive
I havent seen too many movies that I would rate a  but I had no problems giving this one top scoreMoviemaking seems to be like golf for a truly excellent game ALL the elements must come together Everyone involved must have perfect form Director Darabont must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together Of course the actors were excellent Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable and bad guys dont come much worse than themThe other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning middle and end So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong Not so with Shawshank Redemption Just like Goldilocks said This is just right Buy this one for your home collection because youll definitely want to see it again,Positive
This movie takes you through the life of some inmates of Shawshank prison A very moving storyOne of the best stories Ive had the pleasure of seeing in a long timeNormally I dont go out for these types of movies scificlassic horror fan This one really surprised me I actually didnt see it in the theater but caught it on TV then rented the movie Ive since bought it and have actually watched it a few times which is rare for me to do I usually watch a movie once then not again for at least  months to a yearThis movie will one day be a classic in my mindEnjoy,Positive
"Let me review this film on two aspects its merit and its high placement
First of all ask yourself this question Is a film great simply because it achieves I hope many think this is not the case Shawshank has a slow and methodical pace Along with good performances around the board The simple staging and lighting of the film is overdone in its simplicity and I personally see no art in it at all But Im not saying its a bad film Its not and its far from it But to be ranked over vastly more intelligent efforts is a sad reflection on our society
The writing is topnotch The best thing about the film is the flow of the story and I could have simply read a book I am no huge fan of visual effects or quick paced storytelling  but I am a fan of art Reading a book would be as enthralling as watching this film Seeing the acting is like watching lines being delivered but being delivered wellAs for its rating on the site  the film pushes no boundaries in which film often offends people to the point of disliking it It has a nice uplifting story at the end and presses a lot of hot buttons Including murder infidelity and scandal Searching for the soundtrack for this film is what brought me to IMDb for the first time actually So I dare not say this is a bad film I only say its ranked higher than vastly superior filmsRating C",Positive
This picture is a ripoff from the Clint Eastwood movie called  Escape from Alcatraz When you watch it carefully youll notice the similarity between the two of them And not only this movie is a ripoff  the Clint Eastwoods movie is also a stolen idea from the movie called  A Man Escaped  an old classic french movie,Positive
"I like to keep things short and sweet
Incredible unforgettable threedemential characters that develop over the course of the filmAmazing story with tons of twists and turns you will never see comingOne of the best endings in filmActing is outstandingGreat foreshadowingPerfect runtimeI would say to stop reading this review and just watch it already but lets face it you already have",Positive
Ive heard of this movie before i saw it to be honest not a single disagree on the perfectness of the actors or the production or the story or the dialogue man when i saw it i agreed and supported it to the last very minute its one of the best movies i ever watched and it really deserve to the st top movie in the American cinemas history  Id like to thank all the people who worked in or share in it i give it up for their great effort that will last in every ones memory for his life time Im sorry for my weak expression as I am impressed and my words may fail me I did my best to deliver what i think Hope to see new production with this kind of quality and this kind of mastering in every single detail,Positive
I saw it a lot of times and I am ready to watch it again everytime Great actors playing extremly fitting roles and a great story make this movie a go to movie for everyone,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is perhaps one of if not the perfect film Every other great film or any film for that matter has its pros and cons Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it very few against it While I feel there are films out there with better pros the pro to con ratio of The Shawshank Redemption outstands any other film film ever produced I cant begin to describe every amazing element of this film Obviously the performances are exquisite the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary The cinematography in particular struck me Roger Deakins is a master with light and framing I will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the greatest films ever made This film truly lies within the sweet spot of cinema,Positive
I consider this movie as one of the most fantastic and joyful movie to watch It touch a social problem that few movie directors and producers took the risk of doing like the institutionalized thing All of the stories developed in this movie even if they are all related of the main character every own little story is very interesting and full of emotions This movie contains good drama a different comedy insight I think I have seen this movie at least  times and I just dont get tire of watch in it i think every time i watch it i found new thingsI highly recommend to spend time enjoying this amazing movie and just a piece of advice is take the time to read a little bit the reviw and find no one bad,Positive
I cant understand why this movie got such a high rating its a good movie but there are lots of others that deserve to be number  in the best of all time list american beauty pulp fiction Chaplins Buuels or Kubricks movies just to name a few WellIm an old Stephen King fan and the story of Redemtion is good and thrilling and the acting and photography is good as well but its nothing that hasnt been made before dont get me wrong i liked it but i think its just a well made entertaining picture and nothing moreSo watch it and have a good time but dont expect an artistically great work or something all too original,Positive
Its always difficult to choose a favourite movie out of all the movies I have seen but I really believe that this is the one When I first watched it I had not read the Stephen King novella and had no idea what was going to happen which made it much more enjoyable to watch Of course like any movie this was not flawless but was such a terrific emotional experience for someone who is seldom moved by cinema This was such a cinematic triumph and I couldnt believe that it didnt win any of its seven nominations at the Oscars The performances were wonderful captivating the mood of the film to sheer perfection Nothing against Forrest Gump but it should have been easily outclassed for Best Picture It was also a good movie but just nowhere near as memorable as this one,Positive
This movie is one of the few movies that I love to see over and over again Each time I see it I learn more and more  Like figuring out the joke about salvation lies within  I also learned that the movie is more about Red than it is about Andy  It is as if Andy was sent there by God to give Red hope and to bring good to what was evil within  This movie has everything a movie needs  It makes you laugh cry and feel really good giving you a feeling of hope,Positive
After watching this movie i was stunned at how great it was It was the first movie that kept me hooked the whole way through and had everything in it What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so well from the original short story which again was very good How anyone can say it less must not have been watching it properly There is nothing to say to criticise the movie the acting was brilliant the casting great and the directing breath taking But we can not overlook the great writer who brought this story to life Steven King Without having writers like him we would never have any movies to match up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather I am still waiting for another movie to knock it off the top of my top  list however i am doubtful if this will ever happen,Positive
awesome moviethe story is highlight and the way Tim Robbins acted is simply superbone of my favorite movies I really loved all the characters of the movie and all the drama involved in it this is one movie that took over my mind for many days It created a stir worldwide and made me think that movies can be made in this way alsoso I suggest movie lovers to watch this movie and not to miss a single scene in this filmhatsoff to the cast and crew of shaw shank redemption it is one hell of a movie which will be remembered at least for a centurylets hope we get to see more films like these and enjoy the drama and enthusiasm which was provided by this very film,Positive
Was a great Movie  I love the story and the actors were fantastic There is so much to say about this movie But look seriously look and say it is not a great movie from beginning to end Of course a good soundtrack also makes a great movie so the soundtrack also has to be mentioned The Movie Picture is very good good angles of shooting always transmitting us the space inside the prison or rather the space that we have not And finally check out this great movie they repented and were left with a better perspective for life See the movie enjoy and learn To finish just saying that it as a great movie oh wait i already said that no problem its to highlight the idea,Positive
Occasionally you go into a cinema and all the films you wanted to see were full As youve come this far and youre a bit of a film fan you go to see a film youve heard nothing about I did this  years ago with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match I sat and waited to be disappointed  hours later I walked out of the cinema a different person before I had not been moved by a film I didnt care if  Indiana Jones made it Sonny Corleone got wacked Fred married Ginger ET got home Before films were either plot driven or character driven they were action or comedy sad or happy a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed respected  or challenged how I viewed an issue or a personShawshank was different there were characters I believed not just one or two but virtually all Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full range of emotions were explored the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of  people Red and Andy I have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hopeThis has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies I am pleased that I am not alone in feeling this way I am glad that it did not win oscars as I feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award ceremony I relish telling everyone this is my favourite film I have seen it many times and will see it many more,Positive
Shawshank Redemption First time when I heard this name I had no idea what Shawshank is all about I must accept the fact that I was not fascinated by its name but luckily I managed to see this movie This movie is awesome it will fill you with hope when you start loosing hope at some point of time in your life Thats the power of this movie I have seen this movie maximum number of times as I have not seen others Story goes this wayA man who was wrongly convicted murder of his wife and her lover He got two life sentences back to back He felt that he might not be proved good husband but he was not a murderer so he started planning to dig the tunnel to be free from this The way he dig the tunnel and the person who helped him in his project was the crux of this movie So it was his hope that was kept deep inside his heart that provide such a power to escape from the ShawshankPlease rent the DVD and watch it you will surely find it most amazing movie as you have ever witness,Positive
When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption I was in a movie theater on a week night at around pm I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift I was tired and just wanted a little amusement This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me I half reluctantly chose to watch it That night I was not prepared to be blown away I didnt see a movie I was transported by a story I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with I wasnt just entertained I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner If this film remains on IMDbs number one spot for a long time to come Its well deserves it To me personally the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the s were an interesting decade but more than that why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R one if you havent seen it dont let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot Dont listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you Two make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film no phone calls no door bells no other plans Watch it from beginning to end You cant over hype this film its just that good What ive written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film Long live The Shawshank Redemption on IMDb ,Positive
Have watched the thing twice and frankly I still dont have a clue what the fuss is all about Theres hardly anything special about the movie let alone breathtaking intriguing or groundbreaking The beginning is somewhat promising but pretty soon it all gets painfully predictable right down to the moment the credits start rolling The narrative is way too often overdrawn and phoney the music  heavily pretentious and irritating The performances are not bad but lets face it  the script is far from demanding The storytelling is overwhelmingly fairytaleish and even the drastic bits seem oddly out of the place as if thrown in to make the thing feel more dramatic Words keep flowing in abundance soothingly creating the impression of a nap story told by a lit fireplace Having recently watched the ingenious The Straight Story I was astonished to see how much damage may be done to a picture by putting in too much talkAll that is not to say the movie is appaling However an inch above average is as good as it gets Both Midnight Express and Escape From Alcatraz beat the weepy Shawshank experience hands down ,Positive
Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover Set in the s the film shows how Andy with the help of his friend Red the prison entrepreneur turns out to be a most unconventional prisonerTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great in one of the best movies ever made,Positive
There are very few movies which have the power to change a persons life A two and a half hour movie which has the power to turn your long darkest hours into the most delightful moments if you are really willing to feel every bit of the movie This movie gave me a hope and reminded me of a quote that tough times never last but tough people doThere are a lot more things to learn from this movie Dont miss them because you may never come across them in your life so beautifully This movie goes into my favorite movies list which only had  movies so farin  years excluding this one This is my first review which I strongly felt to be postedDONT MISS ITWatched this movie twice yesterday OMG Avoided watching it all these years because I knew there would be a lot of unimaginable brutality Finally gave in yesterday The depth of each character portrayed so fully how their role affected the rest The magnificence of Andys not just surviving  years in that mess knowing his innocence He thrived and did so much good that the corrupt Christian warden was so desperate to keep him there that he committed murder I loved the way that everything was tied together and released by the end,Positive
I feel sorry for all of you  guysgirls who rated this as  star awful I really do not think you could consider this as the worst or one of the worst movies you have ever seen Maybe it is overrated maybe not  but STOP trying to lower its position in the Top  This is supposed to be a USER RATING  so if you loved it  give it a   if for you it is an average movie  give it a  I read some comments about this one  and heard someone saying    it is a good movie deserves  or  stars  but i gave it  star because I think it is very overrated   Thats so pathetic Once again  STOP doing this and rate the movie as you liked it ,Positive
This film is overrated it cant possibly be the best film ever there are much better films than that however it is still a good film,Positive
this is the first time i am really wand to write something about thismovie even though i have watched it a hundred times o so anyone who really wanna know how a movie should b should watch this onemovies are medium which should make us think and this one surely does about lifeanyone wanna know the meaning of patience determination this one does the trick for u watch it and be inspiredthats all i can sayit will change the way u think about things around unever let it die in u,Positive

I have never commented on a film but living as movie lover a great movie lover Ive always been seeking for finest fine movies movies that cant be forgotten that would give a meaning to me The Shawshank Redemption it is a movie that I cant say anything about it else than powerful wellmade and meaningful to me as God as my witness to this moment I havent seen any movie better than that  It was recommended by a dear friend of mine but I never took seriously until I watched the first thirty minutes of it then I regretted that Ive never attempted to watch it before that moment Hope something good never dies I have hope that I believe in and I believe that someday that hope will get me through life The Shawshank Redemption gives hope and thats enough for a movie I dont have that great knowledge of movie but I do believe that this is one of the finest movies that were ever made,Positive
I have grown up watching Bollywood movies full of overacting by overpaid overfed heroes It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freemans brilliant narration offering a secondperson view of life in shawshank But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced wealthy bankerThe last forty minutes of this film however help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces You dont need a weapon to fight It is easy to take away a mans bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hope,Positive
Originally I wrote a very long review of Shawshank Redemption but ive decided not to post it  Instead id just like to say that i would compare the movie to a poem that i wrote in th grade  im not going to write the poem out because i dont have it with me right now but it had to do with rainbows and waterfalls and following your dreams In other words it was complete bs I just wrote what i thought were some typical poetic themes and threw them together hoping people would like it  My plan succeeded the teacher thought it was the best in the class and it got published in the school newspaper Seems like the director of The Shawshank Redemption Frank Darabont and the writer of the book Stephen King did the same thing  The movie is technically well made and does succeed at telling the story  I admit that I got caught up in the ending  But no matter how much you try to defend it its still pure Hollywood  Cliche here and there  I recognize this for what it is  a directors attempt to manipulate peoples emotions which due to a large amount of naivite in the world succeeds  He did the same thing with The Green Mile with more success  Now with The Majestic I am glad to see that it seems that most reviewers and many moviegoers have recognized this and given it generally lower reviews than his first two films  Finally  Now I only hope people will start to give Shawshank lower ratings and get it down from the heights of the top  list,Positive
The Story is too complicated Waiting to another season too maybe Hear broken ,Positive
Im a  pound meanlooking dude but I cried like a baby watching this movieThis is a masterpiece in American story tellingEvery scene builds up the tensionEvery dialog adds depthEvery central character makes senseThe ending makes you smileTim Robbins and Morgan Freemans acting is simply outstanding Throughout the movie you feel you get to know their inner thoughts their longings their fears FANTASTIC MARVELOUS INGENIOUS,Positive
in my opinion its better than the ordinary Monte Cristo story that we all know as the greatest escape tale  so this time the escape is greater and the hero is an ordinary man  who is so patient and hopeful while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may think that its social or silly story but minute by minute you will recognize that you were wrong its a Brilliant Storya never seen before  a very powerful drama  the best thing in that movie was the relations between characterslike hatingand true friendship like the one which was between Tim Robins and Morgan FreemanI like this movie and i advice every one on the planet to watch it as soon as possible,Positive
What to say about the Shawshank Redemption I shouldnt really have to say anything because when most people hear about it they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is This movie is freakin immaculate Darabont and Co have created not only the most inspiring film in ages but one of the most emotionally significant films to date The movie teaches things to us that we need to know  messages on hope perseverance and friendship  and it does it with marvelous eloquency All in all The Shawshank Redemption remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen  a master piece of art Perfect,Positive
Like a beautifully crafted French wine this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year Every time I have viewed it over the past decade and it must be at least more than  times by now I have found newer shades subtler indications and deeper meanings And it has amazed me like very few have No overacting  Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank  Method in the madness of running the scams from inside  The complete secrecy maintained for  years not even Red knew  The best that a highlyeducated intellectual could do inside such a prison  What a great actor the Warden turned out to be  totally despicable  What a bunch of speakable quotes what a bunch  Totally recommended for any young person  students especially  HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS  a message that shines through,Positive
This is one of those films that come once in a blue moon The ones that leave you sitting on your seat staring at the screen when the film is ended and trying to think of a word to describe the excellence of the film Although Shawshank does take a while to get started but you understand why later on the film The characters need to be explained for you to understand later points in the film What really makes this film great is the use of no special effects no stunts just plain simple amazingly originalwitty story writing and outstanding acting by every character in the film including the minor ones Just based in a prison men talking to each other This film does make you feel involved in the film You feel every characters emotions and pain and share their joy and happiness When the film ends it takes you  seconds to get back to reality again  its just that compellingBest personal Film of all time and best film on IMDb and rightly so Spectacular Film ,Positive
An interesting movie with good performances Its basically about hope and hold it together It is the final outcome that matters the mostIs about  imprisoned men who bond over a number of years finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency Robbins Freeman and the supporting cast is good enoughI dont think it is worthy to be the  movie in the IMDb though Thats just not possibleI know that debate started between TSR and TDKAnyway a good overall movie especially if you are into prison dramas then this movie is for you,Positive
"Lets be honest its a fairly mediocre movie Entertaining Ill grant you but profound No way Not much here in terms of innovative or even creative filmmaking eitherIs it one of the most popular films of all time Probably At least of recent time
Is it the greatest film ever made Dont make me laughThat said Im glad people can enjoy this movie I wont watch it again but I dont exactly regret it",Positive
The first time I saw this film I said those three words a lot to my friends and family Shawshank Redemption is the BEST FILM I have ever seen in my lifetime I have seen tons of films Morgan Freeman gave a performance that will touch anyones heart From beginning to end this film shows how films should be made,Positive
This is without a doubt my favorite movie Every time I see this movie I feel touched by its magic Most of my friends have seen it because I have recommended them to do it and they have all loved itRobbins Freeman and Whitmores characters are the ones that I like the mostIt is just stupid unfair and shameful that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at The Oscars nor The Golden Globes The IMBD voters have it at  My hope is to see it in the future at ,Positive
In my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the first time you watch it Its probably my favorite movie It may not have the replay value of some of my other favorites but the first time you watch it when you dont know what is about to happen is the probably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies I only wish could I forget it so I could watch it again for the first time As a matter of fact if I ever suffered complete amnesia there would be at least one definite benefit I am not going to talk about the ending and for gods sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on their comments do not read them,Positive
My favorite movie was really The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank RedemptionA lot of people would might disagree with but I love this movie the actors are great the director has done a fantastic job and the screenplay is magnificentI was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director The acting was worldclass I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since Morgan Freeman maybe eg Seven The twists were unexpected an although this film had a familiar feel it wasnt even slightly pretentious or clichd it was original The cinematography was grand and expressive It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prisonI remember when i saw the movie I didnt want to get up and go to the toilet When I finally was done in the bathroom I couldnt wait to get back and press play on my DVD At the time I was done with the movie I wanted to see the movie againThis film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichs and predictability Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities These artists show their capability to produce art real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you The Shawshank Redemption delivers muchneeded breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget So see it buy it love it,Positive
This is the  Absolute must see film of the s Our Generation anyones lifetime and quite possibly the history of film Hope and perseverance are front and center as themes in this blockbuster Anyone of any age any race either sex and any religion should see this and I promise youll wish to share it with everyone you know Dont think another Prison Movie aboutthis one its above and beyond that clich Expect career performances from Morgan Freeman Tim Robbins Bob Gunton and James Whitmore Along side many outstanding character performances from the supporting cast I Cannot emphasizethe importance of this film I personally thank Everyone involved in producing such an enormous telling of Steven Kings masterpiece It has become a source of daily inspiration for me and I continue to watch it Several times a year to this day thank you,Positive
This movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about life your life       Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins the faith in a dark atmosphere,Positive
Good acting from all concerned carries the rather simplistic and obvious storyline beyond the saccharine but the villains are really predictable in their villany and the storyline while initially moving and affecting seems forced and unreal once you step back from Robbins and Freemans performancesIn other words a high impact movie that rapidly loses credibility with considered thought after viewing Far more worthwhile though than many other similarly stretched dramas and by no means a failure But by no means in the top rank of movie making,Positive
Not only is this film one of the most touching I have ever seen it also has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings I have ever seen  The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best Ive heard,Positive
How many ways can I list why this is best movie of all time  The most perfect ending of any movie Ive ever seen   Best story  Steven King not even a fan of his   Best acting performance Morgan Freeman absolutelyamazing best ever Tim Robbins is brilliant also   Best narration  Morgan Freemans character   Most uplifting touching moving story ever told   Outstanding soundtrack   Beautiful cinematography   Most evil antagonist  The warden  Best dialogue  so many memorable phrases and quotesI could keep going  Ive never encountered a movie that has touched so many people,Positive
This film is probably the best lifeinprison film ever made  It depicts one mans time in the big house for something he supposedly didnt do This man is Andy Dusfresne pronounced Duframe played in his best ever Tim Robbins  But he isnt alone he is joined by fellow inmate who is the only guilty person in Shawshank Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman Freeman narrates the life in The Shawshank prison all the way up until the end not to mention some very memorable escape scenes  Very memorable showing what movies are made of  Based on Stephen Kings novel one of his best and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont who  years later would write and direct the Green Mile another good but cant be matched to this one prison movie  A,Positive
This Film has a Strange History Nominated for Seven Oscars winning none the Movie was not a BoxOffice Hit and Faded pretty much into Obscurity as an Arty Film with two Lead Actors Delivering Standard Good Work but Nothing to get Excited aboutBut Something Happened that is Really Unexplainable People got Excited about it No one seems to know Why or What Manifested said Excitement it just Happened A Resurrection to become one of the most Beloved Movies Ever Managing to Steadily Climb to GodLike Status among Best of Lists and Fanatic PraiseIt is a Fine Movie A Throwback Movie A more or less Standard Storytelling of Human Perseverance and Hope against Outrageous Misfortune A Feel Good Film that has made a lot of People Feel Good Nothing Really Out of the Ordinary Happens as far as Prison Dramas go But what does Happen is done with such Subtlety and Pathos that the Long Sentence of the Running Time goes by Effortlessly This is a Great Movie that Never tries to be Great its just a Smooth Entertaining and Effective Personal Prison Drama with some Social Messaging and Character Explorations The Usual Prison Sledgehammer Approach gives way to a Rock Hammer Small and Light but it gets the Job Done,Positive
The best movie Ive ever seen Ive seen her more than twenty times and its always perfect On the th year anniversary DVD edition Frank Darabont claims that the movie has helped people through divorces and losing love ones and so on just see the movie and youll understand whyThe scene were Andy Dufresne finally gets out of Shawshank and hes standing in the rain and raising his hands is one of the better scenes in the movie history Ive got that poster up on my wall Its amazing how you feel brightened when you see that particular sceneTry seeing the movie a couple of times and then reading the book which is written by Steven King and then seeing the movie again It pushes the movie up to another level and youll like it more thereafter,Positive
I think that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made The acting is crisp and full of endless tension sometimes forlorn and on other occasions full of fear How Stephen King could come up with a horror story like this is beyond me Its a real nightmare to be in a penal system with so many things going against you Personally I think that Forrest Gump FG is also a tale of Hope but in a different sense Firstly FG shows the hope of waiting for the woman you love for over  years Secondly FG shows that there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society and aim for goals I think that both movies are great and should not be missed or inappropiately criticised I also urge people to watch La Vita e bella Life is beautiful as it is as good as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points May we all hope for more movies like thesePS Also watch Its a Wonderful Life James Stewart as this is about hope as well,Positive
I loved this movie Beautifully filmed the story is told as if time does not matter No plot that has to be rushed through no fast cars or anything Just a very good story by Stephen King marvellous actors and a lot of exciting emotions It made me feel good to watch a man who keeps his hope for so many yearsThe scene with the Mozartrecord broke my heart,Positive
I feel like people ranked this movie so high just because it was the thing to do The movie was overall just okay if you really look at it and pick it apart,Positive
im sorry for watching this great film by a pirate video cd thats the only way i can approach movies like this because i live in china in this place you can only see a hollywood movie like true lie those having radical actions in it i watched this movie when all my family were sleeping for none of them likes this movie they have no patience to continue watching movie like this with no action and i really touched in some extents living in china is somewhat like living in shawshank you need hope and endurance to keep on i got a lot from this movie thanks to the director to tim robbins and morgan freemanand the vendor who recommend the video cd to me,Positive

Just watch it if u watch this movie you r gonna get really strong lesson for this life ,Positive
I am bowled over by this movie This is simply the best movie ever made The story just leaves you moved and the performances in the movie are clearly the best performances ever on screen Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman enact their roles to perfection they dont miss out even a dot in fulfilling the roles to excellencyI cant believe i waited so long before i actually watched this movie i should have watched it before and then over and over againDont be scared to watch this movie you will be amazed by this masterpiece I cant stop raving I say WATCH IT NOW  on  isnt enough,Positive
This film will go down in history as one of the greats,Positive
The shawshank redemption is a must watchable movie because the storyline of this movie is brilliant and you will never feel bored a second while watching this movie the acting done by all characters in this movie especially Red is really mind blowing this is a very simple but heart touching movie if you are a movie lover you should absolutely watch it,Positive
Stephen King was surely pleased to see one of his works faithfully represented onscreen The director does an excellent job of showing the bleakness of prison life the frustration of a life gone awry and the misery of losing all one holds dear in life while somehow preserving the hope of better things to come Every actor was perfectly cast and the storyline draws to a perfect and satisfying close If you enjoyed the film youll love the book from whence it came Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,Positive
One of the most wonderfully perfect movies of all time you wouldnt want to change a single framePaul,Positive
This film is a truly awesome film once i had started watching the first  minutes of it i was addicted to the TV and could do nothing but to watch it This story is about a respectable banker Andy Duframe who is sentenced to Shawshank prison for life imprisonment for a crime he did not commit Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn that the prison mentally takes your life However Andy seems very unusual being very quite and polite around the prison At the spectacular climax at the end of this film it just gives the viewer such an amazing feeling of hope and in my opinion this is the best film every made A must watch film ,Positive
I always really enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption and my appreciation remains consistent with repeated viewings With a  IMDB rating decades after its release shows that this is a movie that speaks to people and I have not met anyone who doesnt like this movie Among Steven King adaptations this is probably the best I like Stanley Kubricks The Shining just as much for different reasons But dont tell Steven King that lol The Shawshank Redemption is much more than a prison movie its an absolutely engrossing movie that has audiences glued to the screen from start to finish Director Frank Darabond did a fantastic job putting this together with top notch cinematography direction and a great attention to detail Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give unforgettable performances The Shawshank Redemption is flawless filmmaking and storytelling that has few films that are its equal All and all The Shawshank Redemption is perfect in my book and is recommended to anybody who wants to see a great movie,Positive
This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen  or ever will see If you havent watch it yet just GO Watch it Now,Positive
This movie is excellent in every way you look at it Even the ways you dont know about it is excellent  Every time I think about this movie it makes me want to watch it again Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give one heck of a performance A brilliant masterpiece to show how cruel the system was and how they can take away your freedom with flimsy evidence It was back in the s its probably the best justice system they had  And how cruel the prison system was back in the day nd all time favorite move st being Platoon,Positive
Well after all the glory this film has had I decided to watch it And for my opinion it wasnt that great Was it the hype I dont knowI just didnt like that much to esteem the movie as  in IMDb top  list It was just as boring as Stephen Kings book are Afer all acting was great I have no bad things say about that its only a bad script for my opinion Nowadays when theres such realistic prison descriptions as OZ and Prison break this one doesnt give the spark For a good prison movie I reckon the following If you wanna see a good prison movie you should watch  Blood In Blood Out  If you havent had a chance already Now theres a reality check and a great movie which havent lost its bestbefore date like this one has,Positive
"The is the best movie of all time IMOIts the type of story where you can get lost in and feel like youre actually there watching it all
Its not a fast moving movie with overchoreographed scenes and copious special effects Instead its a simple story with a deep touch that everyone can relate to in some way Then theres the hidden mystery of the escape thats going on and you know its going on but you never see it hinted at until the moment its revealed This will keep you engagedThe selection of relatively unknown actors aside from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman playing minor but pivotal roles magnificently adds to the genuine feel of the story and the feeling of being there in the momentNo surprise that this is often regarded the greatest movie of all time",Positive
Ok as I give this movie a  it is going to be hard to be critical but I feel as though that is the responsibility of anyone who doesnt rate a movie a First of all the acting was sensational  as good as I have seen in a long time The direction was great and the script was great And it turned into unexpectedly a true buddy storyI could only criticize a couple things  one of which was NOT the length   I found it a little troubling that most of the criminals were extremely nice guys  except for the obligatory bad guys in the shower I also have to confess a real distaste for the homosexual overtones  especially early on But then what prison movie attempting to depict real life could leave that outAlso prison movies in the s s and s are not my favorite genre however one of the advantages of prison movies are that you really dont care very much what period it takes place in Anyway that is just personal preferenceAll in all it deserves the praise it gets Im very glad I finally took the time to watch it,Positive
An outstanding movie about perseverance brains and irony Its certainly the greatest prison movie ever made But theres a lot more involved than your average prison flick has to offer Try character and character development for startersThe best thing King has written I love Salems Lot but how can you top this one,Positive
What can I possibly add to a review corpus of over  million ratings and three thousand reviews This movie has been called one of the best movies of all time a powerful story about friendship hope and freedom and a latterday retelling of the Gospel story Many people have seen this movie multiple times and some claim it has changed their lives and even saved their livesAt this point Im rather more interested in the phenomenon than the movie My take on it this movie appeals enormously to ordinary people especially American men who feel trapped by difficult situations in their lives Some may be looking to be rescued like Red was others may take comfort in the thought that their longterm pain tedium and oppression will someday result in a spectacular liberating event This movie satisfyingly scratches that annoying itch called life is unfairIts difficult to know what to think about all this Whatever you think about the phenomenon Shawshank Redemption is also just a good movie with excellent writing black and white characters a simple but satisfying plot with a few surprising scenes great acting and a certain amount of tear jerking Its not a movie to be missed,Positive
It was a great and a pleasant surprise to see that the movie that I chose almost five years ago as my favorite movie of all time is the number one on the list Although its my favorite my choice was based mostly on my personal reaction toward this movie and I did not expect that there are so many people that feel the same way I do about it I love every single thing about this movie every single shot And believe me I know what Im talking about because its the only movie that Ive seen so many times and it never failed to amaze meA great story based on Steven Kings novella great direction by Frank Darabont and great acting by Tim Robbin and Morgan Freeman Not to mention music and the truly original and always inventive dialogue Every body who commented here on this movie probably mentioned all the obvious great things about it I would like to add one thing that made this movie even more spectacular to me The movie contains scenes that present a complete idea that stand and work on its own Like the scene when Andy plays Mozart or the scene on the roof Critics might choose others but theres no other movie touched my soul like this one and Ive seen thousands of them Remember Hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies,Positive
Whilst the IMDb users may disagree the Shawshank Redemption isnt my number  maybe not even my top  But with that said I have seen this movie a few hundred times and it gets wary There is no doubt it is good I may even say its close to great and it has a pretty good watchability rating but its forced metaphors get on my nerves now and in reality is just another prison movie which is above average Boring if you have seen it a few times but for a first impression it is good Once you start to analyze its elements you can begin to see the film for what it is A perfect film it is not but the acting is near perfect and the realism is somewhat accurate Not my favorite film not my favorite prison film but give it a whirl and see how you decide,Positive
In my personal view any person in the world who understands English would never say some thing wrong about this movie If some does understands English and still says something wrong about this movie it means he has not seen the movie If some one understands English and has seen this movie as well and still he says something bad about this movie it means he has a really bad taste regarding movies or he does not know what a movie is According to me these kind of people should be hanged to death This movie has changed the life of thousands of people around the world I dont think that any one having a little bit of intellectual level would dislike this movie,Positive
So i watched this film maybe  times Russian version  original English Read both book versions Its beautiful story When i have watched this film first time after started to follow the career of the actor Morgan Freeman He is a great actor I give the film  stars,Positive
Im sorry I cant buy these guys as criminals and that ruined the suspension of disbelief for me Otherwise an excellent story,Positive
I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular its quite simply beyond me The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of Kings short story found it very true to the spirit of the book and voted  for that I really could not find anything worth my time in this film and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end one or two good lines of dialog and the acting theres really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for Its about hope and the director wont let us forget it so its repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep Its like this short onenote story was written and the author just didnt want to end it so he kept writing and writing until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling for the love of all that is holy stop writing And I thank that faceless man for doing that because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was  minutes long and not  or dare I say it  The film simply drones on and on scene after scene containing nothing remotely interestingbut with excellent acting mind you Theres nothing good about this film except for the acting Just about all of it is great I cant really think of anything else to say I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of Kings writing I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film I recommend this to fans of Stephen King the actors and possibly Frank Darabont If youre not a fan of any of these people I doubt youd find this enjoyable ,Positive
I am so pleased to see the high rating this movie has received Many people I know have never heard of it but when I tell them about it and they rent it they are converted Compared to so many recent movies that are eyecandy this film delivers the true meaning of friendship and focuses on this aspect instead of flasy cars lasers dumb plots and high paid actors bloated with self confidenceAnother movie along the same line is Spitfire Grill Rent it and you will probably enjoy it as much,Positive
Salvation in Shawshank begins with a mysterious and enigmatic atmosphere the result of Frank Darabonts decoupage and perfect atmosphere and the arrival of Andy Dufresne a firstclass banker accused of killing his wife to the prison location By creating a narrator and a relative change of perspective and throwing the burden of narration on the shoulders of the rejectionist Morgan Freeman he invites the audience to judge Doferrin and watch his character from a greater distance,Positive
I really like this movie  It was very well done and the screen play was great  Totally awesome plot and the best acting I have ever saw  I would recommend this movie to anyone  It was a movie to die for  You could tell that they put time and efffort into making this masterpiece,Positive
This movie Im not going to call this film the IMDb  movie but I really cant deny that this is fantastic The cast the score the writing and the power are all here in this film and filled with strength Its one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over It is about a friendship a life an evil and a hope A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls We see these people as years of time goes by We see friendships grow and topics change It really puts you in the prison and makes you feel whats like to behind those bars You feel the friendship the hope the darkness and the pure horror of it all stars out of ,Positive
In the first thirty minutes of watching this show on a slow Saturday afternoon I knew it was my favorite  I was captured instantly by how the story unfolded  You cant help but deeply respect Andy Dufrain I dont know if thats spelled correctly  The way he speaks with thought and hope the way he walks about the jail collecting rocks  Seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is imprisoned in a jail  They couldnt have found a person that suited the roll of Red better than Morgan Freeman  His voice is perfect for the narration of the film  Every card played by this movie was an ace  From the way they filmed the tall barren walls of the prison to the brilliant story thanks to Stephen King for that and lets not forget the music  I am pleased to see that its in the top spot of this site I think it deserves it,Positive
One of the best movies everTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were so good,Positive
I have always loved movies in which to overcome odds a character must think and not just use muscle The Shawshank Redemption is one of if not the best example of this I LOVE IT,Positive
When someone who has never seen this asks why this is my favorite movie  I never know what to tell them Its the perfect movie its like God decided to allow the creators writers and actors to blend perfectly together  with the end result being the greatest movie ever written The first time I saw it I thoroughly enjoyed it but didnt allow for the intake of dramatic genius to fully set in I have seen it over  times since I first experienced it and now it is impossible for me to watch any scene without getting chills down my spine Frank Darabont should have a day made in his name for his adaptation of Stephen Kings compelling and brilliant story No one could have surmised that allowing for one of the more likable inmates to be killed would make the movie even MORE powerfulbut he did One last thingI just wanted to thank God for allowing them to change the ending to that of a diminishing Robbins and Freeman at the end no words needed,Positive
Like a lot of people didnt really seem an interesting title when it was released WHOA This is a movie that I know Ive watched the most number of times than any other movie Fantastic movie,Positive
This is my dads favorite movie and has been since the day it came out It hurts me to break his heart but The Shawshank Redemption is just pretty goodThe highlight is  the characters Each is welldeveloped and has their own stories and problems but this is not unlike most movies in this category This movie obviously was released at the right time and place for its position Everything felt so average maybe slightly above averageI have seen this movie at least ten times The message is deep the character development is great but everything else is just average,Positive
It is year  and yet this movie is still the best movie I have ever seen It truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all times Story telling acting directing anything that you can imagine about a movie is so perfectly done I believe everyone will have his own message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells how important the role of hope in our life is you are at the correct address The atmosphere in the prison the way people feel and the way all these things were put together in a two hours movie there is nothing to say It is just exceptionally plain good A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart,Positive
Run Tim Robbinss name in the database and I dont think youll find that hes starred in too many movies worth watching  Generally most movies hes in have the subtlety of a ball peen hammer across your forehead  This movie atones for a thousand sins  Carefully written deliberately paced lovingly acted this film brings you in and leads you to the light on the other side Nothing is forced but not a single plot thread is left dangling Hollywood needs a lot more movies like this one  See it twice,Positive
Strong meaningful and everlasting message is what makes this movie such powerful The Hope the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature But lots of flaws also This movie lacks originality Approach characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold Portraying of characters is loose and poor Dialogues are pretty ordinary and too conventional Overall approach is just Routine and  the whole movie is based on the Final Impact of  the story In short its actually not surprising no Oscar winning and no including into the  Greatest Movies by American Film Institute Greater Effort in developing characters to be multidimensional and story to be less conventional would produce One of the Best Pity ,Positive
I too was dazzled by this movie when I first saw it Robbins and Freeman were both fabulous and the story was an intensely happy marriage of the nostalgic and edifying to the tense and disturbing The theme of success against the odds is rarely so emotive and the desperate hope and yearning are truly palpableBut its simply NOT the best film of all time Parts of it are cliched most of it is downright implausible The symbolism is trite and way too inyourface particularly with Freeman explicitly spelling out albeit touchingly what should have been the movies duty to portrayThe ending was a shameless exercise in trying to make the world feel better than its ever felt before Films have every right to be manipulative but when its this blatant the magic collapses Or did for me anywayMind you still a smashing flick Im only nitpicking because everybody else seems to be in such a weird frenzy of Shawshank worship,Positive
There are only a few words I have to say Every time I watch that film I have to cry There are not many films which get this result Must have something to do with the direction of Frank Darabont And the acting of the stars is just brilliant As a matter of fact I dont see Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins playing just another role I only see two Persons Andy and Red For a long time I had the problem that when I saw Tim Robbins in another movie I thought of Andy Dufresne But now I will write something about the story Of course I have read the original story written by Stephen King It was in a way different It has not that deep meaning that is perceptible in the movie When I think about this friendship between the two men The sentence Get busy livin or get busy dyin well in a way it shaped my whole live This is definitely the best film I have ever seen,Positive
This is such a good movie that even to this day many years after it came out I still cannot find a single person who does not like Shawshank redemption Everything in this film is timed well The story is excellent and flows with perfect timing and the editing between the sequences are great The acting is great and it keeps you interested from the first to the last frame It also has a very clever plot You are not  sure what Tim Robbins is up to and how he has escaped until much later Great job by everyone from director actors to script Just the best in movie making,Positive
I had heard about the movie since it first came out but somehow I never got around to watching it Now I superglad that I watched it It is an utterly fantastic movie to the max The movie contains almost every human emotion that there is and overall it is a totally wonderful character study as well There is marvelous writing and a totally well thoughtout plot and the acting talent throughout is on an almost otherworldly level It is a movie that captured my attention from the very beginning keeping me totally engaged throughout for the entire duration of the film All said this is yet another movie that I truly wish that I could give more than ten stars because it truly deserves many many stars,Positive
I didnt have a single moment of boredom while watching this movieWhen I think about this movie I wonder why,Positive
This film is hard exciting realistic beautiful and surprising The Shawshank Redemption completely absorbs you and constantly throws you back and forth between joy and sadness It simply blew me away and if it was possible I would give it  without thinking twice,Positive
The best movie ever made period I wont go on a very long and detailed review on the storywhich is magnificent and perfectI just want to say that this movie is a pure piece of art The acting was perfect Im really disappointed that the actors didnt have enough recognition for their performances Actually the overall movie was underestimate by the Oscars especiallyThis movie shows why cinema is an art powerful and heart full art See this movie youll now what Im talking about I really tried to notice some gripes or problems but I cant This movie is touching sad beautiful powerful and perfect By the way fk the Academy Awards for dumping this movie and do for Forrest Gump for the trophiesbut its just trophies Still a shame that they decided that out of ten totally deserves it,Positive
Wow I love this movie To date I have probably watched it nearly  times I am not obsessive whenever it is on I watch itFor most movies at least the dramatic ones I measure them based on how they make me feel This one makes me feel sad when Brooks dies angry when Tommy dies and happy when Red finds his friend This movie makes me feel good I know that is not very scientific but its the truth Because of the way it plays on me I cant help but give it a  Heres whyFirst off the acting Tim Robbins is SO subtle that he strikes me as a person that tries to bury his innocence because in reality it does not matter Few would argue that Morgan Freeman is brilliant as usual But here the supporting cast throws in with equally impressive performancesThe Score Outside the music from the records appearing in the movie the relatively unobstructive score just helps us confirm what our eyes see the walls of Shawshank We feel them through the music and break through them as Andy doesAnd last but not least My compliments on the cinematography The site is perfect for the movie and the clever camera angles and lighting invite us into the dreary prison world,Positive
This is certainly not a bad film but it is Also completely overated in my opinion This story has been done a million times and How the wardens didnt notice he was chipping through the wall everyday to escape is beyond me The acting throughout is very good but i am shocked to see this number  on the chart,Positive
With universal themes such as redemption friendship and gooddefeatsevil tale and without any significant technical flaws it may be difficult to dislike Shawshank Redemption one of welldone Hollywood flicks in the s by invisible employee directors while it may also be difficult to find it compelling imaginative and inspirational Despite a prison situation Tim Robbins keeps looking ridiculously gorgeous all the time but this is madeinHollywood,Positive
One interesting thing about this movie is how quickly it seems to pass  The movie could have continued this story for another  or  hours and I dont think it would have lost my interest  I think just because normal people like this movie is no reason to lower its rating with the movie critics The best movie ever  Definitely  Everything else pales in comparison,Positive
I tell you my voice sailed higher and farther than anybody in a grey place dares to dream to see my favorite movie still reigning at the number  spot on the top  Redemption now let me see I dont think I know what that means to tell you the truth thats a politicians word What do you really want to know does redemption happen in this film well yeah I dont have it stuffed down my pants right now sorry to say but Ill tell you  I suggest you just get busy livin or get busy dyin before you find out how salvation lies within I have to remind myself that some films arent meant to be caged and kept to yourself that theres something inside that they cant touch im talking about hope Those who know Shawshank best talk about it often but its that much more drab and empty now that its gone out of theaters  Its not easy peasy japanesey any more its more like skin burning and half blind from that delousin stuff they throw on you It looked at first like a stiff would blow it over but that was my first impression of the film Theres nothing left but all the time in the world to think about why you havent seen Shawshank yet  From now on Ill write two comments a day about this film instead of one,Positive
Nothing in the history of the entertainment industry compares to this films wonderful inspiring and completely unforgettable ending The title of the film is the on criticism you could make of this masterpiece If you talk to any group of people about whats the best film ever made youre almost guaranteed that someone in the group will mention this filmThe script is superb and both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do make it a moving story of friendship dignity and most importantly hope Its one of those films where you feel obliged to recommend it to everyone you know Theirs something so special about this film and you shouldnt be allowed to talk about films if youve missed this gem,Positive
My story is one of fate I went to the video store expecting to get Terminator II on laserdisc It was out and out of desperation to rent something I asked for what was new I was given the Shawshank Redemption I had never heard of it quite honestly but I gave it a try but was not expecting much but two hours of time passThe first time through watching it I thought it was good Nothing extraordinary But something made me watch it again And I was hooked I cant explain it but this movie gets better every time you watch it I ended up watching it about  times in that  day timespanWatch this movie as your bucket list of things to do in life You really have not lived till you have seen itI admit to being completely obsessed by the movie owning it on every medium imaginable and having all the books and posters about it But do not let my obsession dissuade you I do not impress easily but I can tell you this is simply the greatest movie ever made in cinemaEvery moment and every dialog of this movie fits in perfectly to create the greatest masterpiece in American cinema,Positive
This movie proves its worth of having top spot on IMDb listIt is not only entertaining but also with a lesson never loose hope as it is the best thing a man can haveGreat acting displayed by lead actors specially Morgan freemanTruly a moving movie with great moralclimaxDialouges of this film are well written You will miss something if HAVE not watch it Highly recommendable for those who have give up their hope in life they will find how hope will get best of themI will say that viewers have truly voted for this film without under influence of big  popular name as it usually happensLike godfatherGodfather is nice film but not nice enough to give points above  to it,Positive
Shawshank Redemption gives the feel of a strong firm and amazing story that can move people while sitting down to watch it The characters are memorable Morgan Freeman as Red will always be in my head Tim Robbins and Any Dufrense is amazing as well Shawshank gives the audience a taste of a perfect movie Movies like this dont come often Movies come with strong stories but acting and flow of this story can mess it up Shawshank doesnt disappoint The acting is superb and the flow of the story is unforgettable Based on the Stephen King novel Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption Id say this is one of the movies where the film triumphs over the novel The film also brings a sense of humor which is a very good tool for films like these because if everything is serious its very possible that it might be killed Well people have their own opinion One scene amazes me and probably is one of my favorite scenes in the film is when the prisoners are watching Gilda and theyre all waiting for Rita Hayworth to do the thing with her hair It still makes me laugh and pleased with the acting and reactions of the prisoner and the beauty of Rita Hayworth herself Shawshank Redemption is a oneofakind film where stories come in and the film enlarges the story and puts it into a whole new level The excellent acting and a great adapted screenplay makes this movie one of the greatest films ever in history,Positive
I have to say that it was just fine but not as great as some are making it to be,Positive
Everything that a good movie can have is there is this movie,Positive
I enjoyed this the first time I saw it But then again I was only an easily impressionable yearold craving for new emotion Recently more than  years later I revisited it and barely managed to finish it Bluntly its as plain and trite as it gets In fact I believe Frank deliberately wanted it that way so that it would increase its appeal to the casual movie goers In general I have no problem with a simple feelgood movie that does not take itself too seriously and is not looking to change its audience in a profound way However this does and it seems it is succeeding unfortunatelyWe have a story about hope and its redemptive qualities portrayed by an innocent man that is sent to prisonTims character Its told through the eyes of his closest prison friendMorgans character The narrative framing and flow are rigid there is no rhythm no ebb and flow no metaphors no irony just constant relentless narration  extreme simplicity Its stripped to the point that you can only remember the generic message Dangerous stuff Some people carry it around and apply it diligently The others only observe the snowball effectI hope there are more intelligent endeavors out there I hope everyone sees them and appreciates them I hope  Skip this if you are over  There is no art here  almost no contribution to the art of filmmaking and storytelling,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent film from director Frank Darabont whose admirable in making this story based on a book by Stephen King Tim Robbins gives a great performance as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman is equally impressive as Ellis Boyd Red Redding two imprisoned men looking for redemption who bond after many years while dealing with not only the abusive corrupt prison guards but the violent fellow prisoners amongst them as well Robbins and Freeman had good chemistry together which made their growing friendship that much more believable on the screen The rest of the cast including Bob Gunton Clancy Brown William Sadler Gil Bellows and James Whitmore are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time The pacing was a little slow at times and the running time of  minutes made the film feel a bit long but the rest made up for its few flaws Overall despite its flaws The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a must see a movie that cant be missed It has a compelling story character development drama some humor and exceptional performances by the cast especially Robbins and Freeman who make this one of the best books by Stephen King that was made into a movie Well done Much better than expected,Positive
Darabonts film about an innocent banker and his troubles inside a maximum security prison with a tough warden Gunton Andy robbins befriends an inmate whose friendship gives him hope and is the backbone of the film Morgan Freeman plays this role superbly in what i think is the actors best performance of all time This is Freemans film though Robbins is great in the lead and Gunton is a hell of an antagonist Everything about this film is perfect so i can completely see why its the rd best film of all time on IMDb I am a big fan and have watched it  times and wouldnt mind on seeing it again later down the line IMDb Rating  MY Rating ,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare movies that gets everything right Its not flashy or loud but it hits harder than most films ever could The story of Andy Dufresne a man wrongfully imprisoned for murder unfolds slowly and patiently but never feels dull Every scene matters and every moment builds toward something that actually pays offTim Robbins gives a quiet steady performance that grows more powerful the longer the film goes Morgan Freeman as Red is the heart of the movie The chemistry between the two feels effortless You believe this friendship because its earned not forcedSome movies try to be profound by forcing big moments or dramatic twists Shawshank earns it by just telling a great story simply and honestly,Positive
Ten Thumbs Up if I had them Incredible story incredible cast I would rate this as probably the best film I have ever seen and I have probably seen it a hundred times on cable I would have to say this would be Morgan Freemans best performance out of all of his films There should have been an Oscar for him This film definitely beat out Million Dollar Baby for which he ultimately and finally received his first Oscar The Academy wasnt all there when Shawshank deserved its due Robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job however Freeman carried the film A true drama that shows the bond of two people in horrible circumstances Yes this one is one to own if you dont have itbuy it You wont be disappointed,Positive
Every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that it is my favorite movie of all time But certainly as entertaining a film that it is being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it a great film or dare I saythe greatest film ever madeBut what then makes a film great First and foremost if it sets out to entertain the general public it must do that and Shawshank certainly does that Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its inclusion in the great IMDb greatest movie debate The serious nature of its central plot pointsa wrongly convicted murderer who assists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escapeis contrasted by some truly funny scenes Although by no means a comedy the splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog Theres nothing fancy about this filmno special effects spectacular scenery or even a bunch of pretty women No its just the telling of a story mostly through the narration of Morgan Freemans character Red that almost lulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to happen here But after all of the subtle plot twists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like Im actually sharing in Andys redemption Now if that isnt what they teach in Filmmaking  then they should just close up the classroomUltimately there cannot be a single motion picture that is the greatest film of all time because as art and in an art form as varied as cinema greatness must be measured by each individual Greatness as beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder But in this beholders eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film I have ever seen,Positive
If you havent seen this film watch it as soon as you can Maybe youve had the chance to do it but just skipped it because you thought it was one more story in prison Yes and no YES because most part of Shawshank Redemption happens in a prison but NO its not like the others Its much betterThe story you may know more of it in the Plot Outline is really interesting and the performances are just impossible to forget There is a little of everything drama friendship violence love and dreamDream of Freedom Thats the title in PortugueseMy Rate ,Positive
In the far western reaches of south west Wales I was lucky to be born to a father who had immaculate taste in film At the tender age of  when I started to understand the complexity of human emotion I was introduced to this beautiful film I remember the first time I sat and viewed the film my father put the VHS in the video player and left me alone to begin my relationship with this film from the age of  I reckon I must have watched this old film twice a year since and every time I still think this is probably the best film I have ever seenJust thought Id express a little of how I feel about this film hope you dont mindAl,Positive
This movie i dont know how did i miss it heard from no one at all N e ways not many good movies are subject of talking in India and  days ago i was searching IMDb  which i know since just a few days ago  and i got this movie name a couple of times in few titlesguess what thought of renting it to give a try to IMDb and OH MY GOSH I know i am writing about a movie which is more than  years oldbut Oh my its kind of  am now and i have just finished watching thisand man this is for sure in my Top  movies of all times  u know i just dont have Hollywood movies in my list but bollywood movies too  and it makes it to Top  explains that what a great movie this isThe story is simplebut boy try to do some guessing work here and if u succeed tell meMorgan Freeman is phenomenal actor This movie is his legendary workthe other guy i am seeing him for first timeand i kind of believe now that he is great actorBut all credit goes to the Director and the Writer of this wonderful movieSuch a simple story told so powerfully and controlled so amazingly is just greatThis one sure gives hope to most hopeless people in worldWatch it guys if u still havent this is best Hollywood can give u believe me and zillion fansand now i have to specially thank IMDb and fans of this movie on IMDbits u who recommended me this amazing moviethnx so much,Positive
InspirationalGet busy living or get busy dieingFrom the richness of supporting actors to the lead roles this is the most complete drama film anyone would lucky enough to find on there own like i did on one evening in the video store A Tour de Force from Castlerock Frank Darabont Tim and Morgan FreemanA path a passage call it what you will this is what film for me is all about depth colour emotion and the strangest thing isit just doesnt happen with guys Well i was spellbound and shocked at the ending and then looked after by the director as they completed the film on the beach in MexicoA truly wonderful film worthy of not just the Oscar nominations but the all the Oscars themselves To be taken on a the most wonderful of cinematic journeysThis is what we all dream ofFrank Darabont Morgan Freeman Tim Robbins and Stephen Kings Finest HourExceptional ,Positive
Fresh movie Very good I do be liking Morgan Freeman and Andy Dufreshne,Positive
Seriously if ever theres a film that people should be forced to watch its this The acting in it is truly perfect the storyline in very very well written and the ending is one of the cleverest and most misleading endings I have ever witnessed This film can and will be enjoyed by people of all ages relatively  check parents guide for suitability and will keep you in suspense for the full duration Unlike in most other Hollywood films the twists in the storyline are very well executed and it is in no ways cheesy or cheap Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his life without making his fellow actors overact The Shawshank Redemption blows every other prison dramas out of the water See it at all costs,Positive
The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched themI didnt intend to see this movie at all I do not like prison movies and I dont normally watch them I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons she said to me Whenever I feel down or depressed I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better At the time I thought that was very strange One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already I remembered what she said so I watched it I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showingNo action no special effects  just men in prison uniforms talking to each other,Positive
I have no idea why this movie has received such a good rating Its an average prison movie without any highlights Typical Hollywood stuff There are hundreds of better movies around The movie drags the actors are average Its just this typical heartbreaking stuff and far away from other movies up on this list,Positive
The movie was a great success The main character was very positive in all three aspects In despair also do not give up and through years of efforts to escape from prison to punish the wicked The movies main character allows himself to bring a little hope to the dark prison,Positive
Most beautiful movie i have ever seen in my life i love morgan freeman and tim robins acting in this movie,Positive
Wish I could go back in time and see it for the first time again because the story moved me deeply Fantastic movie all the way through not a single issue to report here,Positive
What can I say about Shawshank that hasnt already been said This is one of my alltime favourite movies and Ive seen it maybe a dozen times but I keep going back for moreTim Robbins is cast perfectly as Andy Dufresne a man convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to prison but who somehow never quite lets prison break his spiritIn a sense this can be compared to Cuckoos Nest Andys effect on the prison and his fellow prisoners is much like MacMurphys effect on the mental patients And Warden Norton has a Nurse Ratchedlike character full of selfrighteousness and a kind of indignation at having to teach them a lessonSimple story or not this movie is uplifting and inspiring Wonderfully acted and directed Shawshanks status as a classic is welldeserved,Positive
This movie has to be one of the very best films ive seen in my lifetime I am usually not that fond of drama films but the portrayal of the characters and the amazing script made it a perfect translation from the Stephen King book Morgan Freeman gives one of his best performances in this movie and actually makes you believe him as a jail smuggler better than Chris Rock in the Longest Yard ever did The cinematography is brilliant showing the sheer scale of this old decaying prison The movie may not have received any Academy Awards the show was stolen by Forrest Gump that year but it still remains to be one of the best films around If your looking for a deeper movie more than youre typical action flick this will provide what you were looking for Go out and rent it heck go and buy it because youll want to watch it time and time again,Positive
"It is not my favourite movie ever but it works for almost everyone That is saying a lot
It has emotion and it is difficult for me to find a movie so moving as this one without being manipulative and cheesy Hollywood seems stuck in creating much noise at first glance and being empty at posterior views Here it worked for me since the first view The emotion is always there sometimes taken from the dialogue or from the soundtrack or the unexpected direction the movie takes",Positive
"A very good description about a realistic film
Long will be in the first place",Positive
Shawshank Redemption has been elevated in popular opinion to the status of masterpiece because of one irrefutable virtue It is accessible Regrettably as is true in so many cases popular opinion is an inaccurate gauge of this pictures actual quality The reason this film has attained its current level of acclaim is that it is impossible to misinterpret its theme or message impossible to be offended by it impossible to be confused by However as this review should show it is entirely possible to be unimpressed by ShawshankThe story of Shawshank Redemption is something I might expect if I was being pitched a script by middle schoolers The complex coincidental frameup the daring escape the clear cut definitions of good and evil the timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummated on a beautiful shoreline Each step more unsurprising than the last each beat more clichd that the last Every time the filmmakers feel like building tension or revealing something about the characters they take the most obvious road This might be excusable if the road didnt also lead to the most obvious destinationsPeople also praise the acting in the film While it isnt at all bad its hard to be impressed when the actors are playing such simplistic roles Stereotypes when acted well are still boringI sincerely hope that over time when the film has settled into history and once people are more able to set this pandering film along side its heavily plundered predecessors it will become clear that it offers nothing new and that what it does offer it doesnt even offer all that well,Positive
A couple of bests for this film the best King adaptation ahead of Misery and Stand by Me and in the conversation for one of the best films of all timeShawshank has stood the test of time since the sacrilegious Oscars debacle of  Two films should have beaten Forrest and it is line ball between Pulp Fiction and Andy Dufresnes epic prison sentenceRobbins and Freeman have never been better as Andy and Red whose nonsexual love story is the unique difference that sets the film apart from the usual prison movie clichesIt can be hokey too long by  minutes and perhaps even a bit preachy But it is incredibly well made and very entertaining ,Positive
I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption Shawshank encompasses friendships hardships hopes and dreams And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you it gives you hope Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different you dont feel that far removed from what the characters are going throughIt is a simple film yet it has an everlasting message Frank Darabont didnt need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film the narration and the acting does that for him Why this movie didnt win all seven Oscars is beyond me but dont let that sway you to not see this film let its ranking on the IMDbs top  list sway you let your friends recommendation about the movie sway youSet aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie,Positive

I cant find another word to describe this movie AMAZING The title is so horrible and i never expected i would watch it for  minutes But when i saw it i realised the big mistake in not watching it earlierThe movie has a beautiful plot set over  years Every part of the movie has a bearing on the ending And never did i imagine such a spectacular ending Not many movies can boast of a suspense of such a kind This movie is not a thriller nor is it adventure but it is a desire of a Man who lives on Hope and who paves his own Destiny Shawshank Redemption leaves you with a elated mind and a moral that it is fear that holds you back and Hope that carries you forward I have only one message for IMDb viewers Just watch Shawshank Redemption Do not avoid it because the title is bad or else you too will have the same wretched feeling that i had today Wish i had seen it when i did have an opportunity a decade ago Well sometimes cinema is like this You go for titles stars and big buck films and come back home disappointed But Shawshank Redemption proves that all you need is a excellent script a good director and some thespians like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins,Positive
I would recommend this movie to everyone The acting directing cinematography are all top notch The cast are so good that its hard to imagine anyone else in those roles If this movie does not make you laugh and then at the very least make you cry a little bit then you have no soulThe greatest movie never to have won an academy award  no doubt The greatest movie of all time  possiblyIf you have never seen this movie you are lucky because i will never again be able to see it for the first timeA truly heartwarming and inspiring piece of cinema Awesome,Positive
I wont repeat the ravings by others about this Movie yes thats a capitalized M Ill just share with you my experience watching it on CNN last month Im a graduate student and midterm week was approaching I constantly said to myself Ok Ill go to the library at the next commercial break  but without me knowing it my butt was glued to the seat after the first  minutes and by and by I forgot I was watching a film Finally when it was over I was left tearful and speechless It was that powerful an experience I even feel that my life is enriched so much more after watching the film Those  hours are worth every second of it I can tell you that,Positive
I cant believe that something so simply good exists This is by far the best thing i have ever watched on my TV I loved every piece of it and im gonna watch it once a year till my time on this world is over I cant describe the feeling and joy you will have after watching it because i cant find the right words to describe it Watch it and you will see what i mean The first time is always the best Its the time when it will leave you speechless for a couple of seconds And after those seconds you will begin to understand that you just watched a masterpiece What i liked the most is the big time span in which the movie plays All those years in one place and the dependence for some people after you leave it,Positive
One of the best films Ive ever seen you just have to see it for yourself and you will know why However if youre a big Sly or Arnold fan you may not like it as it doesnt have any exploding cars plus it has a lot of dialogue and some words with more than two syllables,Positive
I liked it not bad but in some places it was kind of boring for me but in general I was satisfied with this film well done they shot well only of course I fell asleep at the end but theres nothing to worry about I liked it not bad but in some places it was kind of boring for me but in general I was satisfied with this film well done they shot well only of course I fell asleep at the end but theres nothing to worry aboutI liked it not bad but in some places it was kind of boring for me but in general I was satisfied with this film well done they shot well only of course I fell asleep at the end but theres nothing to worry about,Positive
Shawshank is nothing more than a fairy tale  It tells us as much about what prison is really like as Pretty Woman tells us about what prostitution is really like  People like fairy tales so both these movies were very popular,Positive
What I can say is this is a really great movie It tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope You will succeed in the end And also be ready at any timeMaybe it is because of language problem I dont grasp it very well in the beginning But step by step I understand it And in the end I understand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that doesnt happened in the movies I have ever seen in the past And also the performance skill is another thing I like it They are good actors And this is the movies that seldom take manwomen sensation as topic but still give people good feelingsGreat movie encourage you while entertaining you,Positive
This is one of my favourite films ever Why Well a lot of reasons really But mostly because of the plot It contains just about everything needed for a film to really work like art The actors are superb note Freeman  why he didnt receive an Oscar for this one Ill never understand The story is great and written by my all time favourite writer  Stephen King Misery Dolores Claiborne The Shining Carrie and more which are all among my absolute top films Try them out I promise you all several great moviemoments,Positive
First of all you need to be prepared for this  hour long moviethough the movie worths itMorgan freemans background voice will keep you with the storyDialogues were well executedThe strongest part was its narration which makes it the bestI wouldnt have watched this if it wasnt on the top of IMDb listAt some point of time i felt the movie is just dragging on the storyStill at the end you wont mind it The movie also carries the message of friendshiphopewill and brilliance of our protagonistSometimes i felt pity on him and sometimes i couldnt stop myself praising his brillianceI think this movie will keep impressing generations aheadno matter how much advance human becomes,Positive
"Its the best plot ever
this film is one of the best films that made my day i watched it over  times and i learned many things from it every time i watched it",Positive
"Nice film i cant speak english but nice
yes nice
the best",Positive
So simple dont do like me and waste  years saying meh Ill watch it anothertime just watch it when you find it You will enjoy it,Positive
I had been meaning to watch this movie for a long time but I got the chance only yesterday when I watched it on HBO I can only say that for eight years I had missed a chance to witness a brilliant work Tim Robbins is really good so is Morgan Freeman But the movie is not about any central character The movie as a whole is devastatingly perfect I saw Forrest Gump and thought it was awesome deserving of the Oscar But eight years since I have to change my mind,Positive
There are some things in this life we will never understand How did the universe begin What happens to our souls when we die How did a movie as bland as The Shawshank Redemption become so overratedIn the case of certain other movies I can at least understand the reasons why theyre overrated But The Shawshank Redemption is so average And clichridden The films moral is basically that hope is important and theres nothing wrong with that in itself Heck  I have no problem with simplicity The problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic The movie treats its borrowed plot parts Count of Monte Cristo anyone and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom I wouldnt be complaining if it didnt pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion However it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours If it had ended moments earlier instead with that poetic shot of the sea I would have had some respect for it thats where the superior original story ends But no the director had to spell things out for his audience Frank Darabont knows how to tell a story He just doesnt know how to tell one with any originality or depthThe movie is partially redeemed by three things The majestic cinematography the powerful score and most of all Morgan Freeman one of the very best actors working todayAs for my rating yes Im one of those jerks who gives a movie a  just to lower it on the top  I think its outrageous how highly its ranked here Even the folks who made it would think its ridiculous to consider it one of the greatest films ever made,Positive
Very few movies that made me cry  and The Shawshank Redemption is certainly one of them I remember when I first went to see this movie in my freshman year in college The movie made me appreciate freedom and true friendshipVery powerful picture indeed and each actor deserved an Oscar for their great performance It is sad that the movie did not get the true scale of recognition it deserved but being on the IMDb top  movies of all time based on peoples votes is a great way to show the well earned appreciationIf you did not watch this movie yet then you missed a lot,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is hands down the GOAT movie  the best Ive ever seen Its a powerful and unforgettable story of hope friendship and resilience inside the harsh walls of Shawshank prison Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give truly iconic performances bringing depth and heart to their characters The narrative builds slowly but masterfully leading to one of the most satisfying endings in cinema history Every moment feels purposeful and the emotional payoff is incredible This film is a timeless masterpiece that inspires uplifts and stays with you forever A mustwatch for all movie lovers This is the best movie I have ever seen in my  years of life,Positive
When I watched Shawshank Redemption at firstI had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me I say that I learned how to follow your passions and hopes how to struggle to be free And  dont never forgethope is good something and good somethings never die  this sentence which passes in the film I always believe it every part of mine Because A person lives with his or her hopes and passions so If it is seized from peoplethat people lose their aims in the life And what the best properties of this film It shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for peopleIn addition to my review about Shawshank Redemption Whenever I watch this film I learn that it puts in new things my life It is so important for every watcher Shawshank Redemption should be watched and I advise it to you ,Positive
I know lots has been said about this film since it bombed at the box office then became a hit through video rental I am probably not going to add anything new I am a Stephen King fan and have a policy not to watch the films made from the books as they usually turn out to be quite dodgy However I was urged by a friend to give it a go and I was not disappointed This film is about hope and redemption and the characterisations are faithful to the original storyTim Robbins is perfect in the lead role quietly enigmatic just as I had pictured when reading the bookThe movie is quite old fashioned in concept but dont let this deter you You are taken through the whole spectrum of human emotions and end up feeling better because of watching it The relationship between the two lead men is charming and kind of restores your faith in human natureYou must watch this movie whether or not you have seen it before because it makes you feel goodThis film will end up being a perennial classic up there with the likes of its a wonderful life and the wizard of ozI cant think of a single criticism,Positive
I have been waiting a long time to watch this movie and I couldnt be more pleased The Shawshank Redemption is something like I have never seen before The story was brilliant from beginning to end and it is definitely something that I will never forget The acting was wonderful the story was genius and the whole movie was just so beautifully done I cannot find a single flaw and therefore I gave it a  This movie is now perhaps one of my favorites and I think that it is absolutely essential to watch,Positive
I like the superficial subjects has to choose for his films,Positive
The films been IMDbs  for as long as I can remember That doesnt really raise my expectations considering I dont agree with so many inclusions or exclusions I thought this was absolutely fantastic Yes its pretty sentimental in a big way but unlike that years Best Picture winner it tells a captivating simple yet intriguing story that manages to earn its emotion with some really heartfelt characters and superb writing Its hard to hold anything against it if you liked it of course when its so unpretentious and gentle Freeman is fantastic unsurprisingly but Tim Robbins is so bloody brilliant in this Watching Rectify now Aiden Young seems to be playing in the same ballpark in terms of the similarity in his portrayal,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies I have ever seen The movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King Unlike most of his novels King didnt write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places Overseeing the transition from book to big screen is Frank Darabont who in his director debut scores a home run with this movieNot only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a fantastic job as the  central characters and as friends Bob Gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden The directing cast and plot all combine to make the movie awesomeThe plot of the movie revolves around Andy Dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit Over time Andy becomes friends with Red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison The story then follows the  and how they handle prison lifeYears go by but Andy continues to speak of hope Ultimately Andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational The message the story delivers is to never give up hoping The climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film historyOverall the Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time,Positive
Well as the other more than  review say it in my opinion this is the best movie created so far It basically just how life is you get punched in a face time to time but you have to stand up keep your hope and give value to your fellows because in return life takes care about your reward Oh yes and if you face any evil that you can stop do it This is the message of the film if we follow it life may be as rewarding ultimately for us as for the hero Other films that moved me like this Forrest Gump The curious case of Benjamin Button IMDb says I have to write another line in order for them to post my review so here it is xD,Positive
I personally think that the way this movie touches me cannot be put into words The core of this movie is hope hope that overcomes every obstacle placed in your way the knowing that the wronged people in life can triumph over evil This is what Andy Dufresne achieves and the tag line of Fear can hold you prisoner hope can set you free is perfect The underlying theme is friendship and Andy and Reds friendship is perfectly portrayed here by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins They are both fine actors and I feel here they give career best performancesalthough Morgan Freeman is generally good in everything Morgan Freeman should of won an Oscar for his subtle approach to this role  surely his million dollar baby Oscar is a belated one for this movie too The directing the story and everything combine to make this a special movie  dont worry the ratings in the all time list which always put this movie in the top  are not wrong This is a movie everyone must see,Positive
Shawshank Redemption based on a short story by Stephen King is about a man named Andy who is sent to jail after being convicted of killing his wife and lover He adapts to jail and is planning something big  all through the film clues are given as to what he is doing as he takes advantage of certain privileges he hasHe makes friends with people in jail and goes through his daily life Hope is all he can hold on to count on and rely on Through years he figures a way to end all of it The story fallows himself and friends as they try to rid themselves of an underlying feeling  a feeling of always being trapped They hated the walls of the jail Theyve grown used to them And they love them But not AndyEverything about this movie is amazing Screenplay cinematographyacting production its simply one of the best films off all time,Positive
This for me is film at its best The acting Tim Robbins in particular is amazing Morgan Freeman is his usual wonderful self also the screenplay the production thewell all of it I could rave about it until Im blue in the face but Ill spare you and myself that I must have watched it over a dozen times now and with every viewing I still get as caught up in it as I did the first time I saw it For me thats one of the marks of a special film Im dont really want to use the term uplifting yet again but it is the best way to describe it Highly recommended,Positive
This film is nothing but one cliche after another Having seen many of the s of prison films made from the early s to the s I was able to pull almost every minute of Shawcrap from one of those filmsWhile it is visually well made and acted the story has every plot point of the standard prison film They have the evil warden innocent main character friendly guilty guy thugs and one good old prisoner Dont waste your time on this one Rent or buy some of the classics of the prison genre,Positive
This is one of the best movies about friendship Ive ever seen also one of the best prison movies I found it better than Robert Redfords CASTLE Morgan Freeman was perfect as usual and I can say that Tim Robbins reached the top of his performance and also his career I wish this couple come together for another movie the kind of it is not important Im sure the spectators will have the same taste as before I watched most of the films of Morgan Freeman and I can say this was the best of his normally he prefers to play in films like SevenKiss the girlsAlong came a spider but I think he should think again that which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts,Positive
This movie is easily one of the greatest movies of all time The Shawshank Redemption is an adaptation of Stephen Kings novella titled Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption This movie is truly a masterpiece with the perfect casting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman The lessons you learn the emotions that were touched the friendships that were made and overall the redemption that every character got in their own way is what made this movie special This movie teaches you about hope and institutionalization which means being stuck in one place for so long that its all you ever know It shows the darkness about being in prison In conclusion this movie is a  Hands down one of the greatest movies ever and Ill definitely rewatch it in the future,Positive
I do not even feel as though I need to go into a great amount of detail to explain just how amazing this film isYouve probably seen the movie sitting on the top spot of IMDBs top  or maybe youve heard a friend babble on about how great the movie is and know it must be halfdecent I can assure you this will live up to your expectations The acting the plot the setting the cast the directing the messages and symbols the acting again deserves another mention is just about as perfect as a movie can be in this setting Please dont waste your time pondering over whether or not to see this movie or whether or not you should believe the hype because I can assure you you can Go buy this from your local movie store or buy it online  I really dont care  just make sure you watch this film before anything else As an yearold guy I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen  or ever will see Go watch it Now,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is currently number one on the IMDb Top  list I dont particularly agree with that but it is a truly great movie nonetheless It is moving and compelling and it touches the heart and soulThe story is set in the s and it involves Andy Dufrense Tim Robbins a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison As one would expect he is very unhappy at first but then he leans that theres something deeper that nobody can take away from you hope As the story unfolds over the years Andy eventually becomes very influential within the prison and gains the respect of other inmates especially Red Morgan Freeman with whom he develops a special friendshipThe story isnt original or creative and its relatively simple and a bit predictable but its compelling moving and memorable and theres a bit more to it which I wont go into The movie puts the viewer right into the footsteps experiences and emotions of the characters Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on great performances They really bring out their characters and offer true depth and emotion One of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person may be imprisoned even for life but the spirit can never truly be imprisoned The movie conveys this moral message very strongly and it truly touches the heart and soulI am very glad I watched this movie It is a truly emotional experience,Positive
One of the best movies that i have ever seenIt truly transcends time and is an epic in all proportionsPeople just dont make movies like this anymore and this is one of my favorite movies of all time The movie is About Andy Dufranea banker who has been wrongfully acquitted of killing his wife in cold blood and send to shaw shank prisonthe movie shows the various hardships faced by Andy and how he does not give up hope and carries on with patience and finally becomes free the climax is absolutely spellbinding and will leave you aghastit is a truly great movie and i was aghast at finding out that this movie was a failure in the box officeBUT NOW ALMOST EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THIS MOVIE FOR WHAT IT TRULY IS  A MASTERPIECE OF STORYTELLING,Positive
I am so happy to see this film top  in IMDb It deserves to be there The Shawshank Redemption appears in  I think this year was full of amazing pictures It lost Oscars but gained recognition This is a great story about friendship and redemption Frank Darabonts best movie for sure Andy Dufresne is one of the greatest characters ever made in the cinema art A guy who is innocent and get punished This film shows us that even our intention is a crime in a legal world No one is perfect and no one can predict anything We live by a scheme and trying to be fair People will always make mistakes and the greatest thing is to learn from them I am waiting for movies which can touch me like this one but after the year  nothing close to that appears There were great films about life and stuff but still its a modification a copy thereof what was before I think until the year  most of the valuable things in film art was told Its a little sad but this kind of art will always be deep in my heart as a lesson and beauty how fantastic picture man create I hope there will be at least couple movies in my short life that leave so many emotions like The Shawshank Redemption In XXI century it is a very hard thing to do I am patient and have positive thinking that cinema didnt say the last words,Positive
I didnt intend to see this movie at all I do not like prison movies and I dont normally watch them I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons she said to me Whenever I feel down or depressed I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better At the time I thought that was very strange One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already I remembered what she said so I watched it I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showingNo action no special effects  just men in prison uniforms talking to each otherThe Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen I do not judge it by its technical merits  I dont really care about that I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best The best movies are ones that touch the soul It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul,Positive
Sorry folks but this movie is a C movie and not an A I cant believe that people like this movie so much Yes I am biased I really dont like Tim Robbins but he has made a decent movie or two but this aint one of them This is your basic prison movie What can I say it has the host of usual characters  The storyline is basic the outcome I wont say but it is just stupid to say that this is a great movie I didnt think it was realistic at all and anybody who falls for this crap is either delusional or needs some brains to differentiate between an Edsel and a Lamborghini I wouldnt watch this movie again unless I was paid to do so One viewing is enough for this predictable laugher,Positive
one of the films that you must watch in lifetime A film about longterm imprisonment that takes its time to convey what the slow crawl of a lifers existence might feel like Thoroughly gripping and pretty refreshing Ten years ago The Shawshank Redemption was a lowkey prison film that didnt recoup its costs Slowly it has become one of the most popular movies of all time  and for some it has even been life changing It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison but The Shawshank Redemption creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick superficial emotions Shawshank slows down and looks It uses the narrators calm observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars It is deeper than most films about continuity in a lifetime based on friendship and hope,Positive
This film is really an amazing movie timeless One of my all time favorites About the longcan write something in a movie Masters said everything I needed There is not yet aware of the movie and I watched it for people to watch I would like to inviteThan YouShawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively And James Whitmores portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film As well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it As I bet youll want to see this one more than once,Positive
If you have not seen this film yet you are really missing something in your life It is almost like never tasting Coca ColaThis film is that good The great Morgan Freeman not only puts in the greatest acting performance of his life but quite possibly the greatest performance of all timeThe script is so excellent that every word spoken sticks in your mind and later on in the movie you remember every word before it is recollectedThis film makes you angry upset romantic sick and elated It touches all of the senses and you cannot take your eyes off the screen for one minuteThe cinematography is excellent and so is the research and hard work that has gone into ensuring that all of the costumes and props are of the era,Positive
L have nothing to sayits a story about hopeand its use montage techniquea deep suspenselt tru that everyone love it,Positive
I dont easily remember the names of actors of Hollywood movies neither do I ever take the time off writing comments on any movie but for this movie i have to do it allThe whole way of presenting this movie has been outstanding ie from the beginning to the end Great performances Tim Robbins  Freeman Qualifying as one my favorite actors The whole presentation has been very apt to the movie But what is important is the strong message this movie transcends ie of Hope is truly recommendableThis movie deserves an intent watch by all Do take you some time off to watch the movieif not twice be it once,Positive

If you are looking for an inspiring jorney to feel the magic of life you should stop searching and watch this title,Positive
Its a perfect example of a movie that never gets old Love it,Positive
This is by far and away one of the best Hollywood films made in a generation The drama was compelling the acting was admirable and complimented the story to perfection The writing was exquisite and placed a balance on leading dialogue and narration This is a great example of what film making is all about It doesnt rely heavily on movie magic but instead uses camera movement framing and acting as equal tools in delivering an amazing story to audiences,Positive
Shawshank Redemption is overrated Its a decent above average film but by no means a great filmThe inmates are pretty much likeable while the warden and his pet guard are monsters Also as Freemans character says You know that everybody in heres innocent As the story develops you feel like he is right the only criminals are the ones guarding the prisonersThis is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions but not to stir them too much Just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the world but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to he who waits  years or so for itThe Shawshank Redemption is as I said a decent film possibly among the top five films of  IMO the best films of  are Pulp Fiction and Lon,Positive
This is a movie to be watched over and over  Each time I get a little bit more out of it  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have a great chemistry together  Many people do not realize that this movie was based on a Stephen King one of my favorite authors novel Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption especially since it is not of the horrorscifi genre I was really glad to see this one at the top of the list,Positive
This movie is flawless in my opinion  Every situation and character are so intricately woven there is no wasted celluloid here  Every aspect of the movie from acting directing and all factors that make up a masterpiece are in top form  It is truly a testament to the spirit of man and how each one of us handles what life throws at us in our own way  If you are feeling down give it a watch and its hard not to be inspired  I find more meaning with each viewing  Its one of the few movies that Ive not grown tired of watching again and again  Once again in my opinion its one of the best,Positive
Best movie ever Ive seen it about  times now and it never gets boring,Positive
I have come here writing my review after just watching this wonderful film My soul is full Overflowing tears of joy down my face Therefore I am afraid that the tremendous emotion tremble will not let me be objective However I really do not care Im just writing to share with all of you the greatness of this movie A movie that brings to screen hope despair true friendship perseverance and human nature like no one before If you just are reading reviews to see if the film is worthwhile well dont lose more time and watch it,Positive
the year the greatest movie to exist on this site was createdto bad you moviegoers disagree Godfather Part I is a classic but get real you cant defy this movie  It may get slow at points but it overcomes that with amazing cleverness and a few tricks up the directors sleeve If you see or have seen this movie you will find or know that this movies brings out many surprises,Positive
This film or may be masterpiece changed the whole outlook of mine towards life The characters played by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were so real and so closed to my heart that I cried and I laughed with them while watching it for the first timeWe learn from books we learn from our parents we learn from our friends and we learn from movie like The Shawshank RedemptionOnce upon a time I was going through a bad phase of my life and bit depressed also Then some suggested me to watch this What happened next was simply miracle The pain endured by Tim Robbins was no less than mine But it was hope that kept him alive That infused a new joy in my life and I achieved success in very little amount of time The dialogues are simply straight yet touchingThe movie has universal appeal  It can move anyone because characters played by Freeman and Robbins are so close to heartDouble thumbs up to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for teaming up and offering this life changing piece of cinemaThis movie was not made for Oscars although it grabbed multiple nominations and not for critics some critics ridicule about its number position in IMDb  It was made for common people like usHumble salute to all who were directly or indirectly associated with this all time classic,Positive
just read the title Tough I think its a pretty decent movie but not as good as the Stephen Kings novel i just cant understand why it should deserve to be ahead of everyone else in the top  with the exception of the godfather To be honest i dont even really think it should be in the top  Yeah I know you Americans love the happyending Vaselineflavored subtly homosexual jail movies but all this hype its too much anyway Come on this cant be better than Welles Kubrick Kurosawa or Scorsese or not even Carpenter and Fulci in my humble opinion So I give it a  This is not a critical valuation of the movie This is a political statement,Positive
"I loved this movie 
It was smart clever and brings you inside behind the wall The actors are brilliant the writing was awesome I highly recommend you see this movie",Positive
To be brief as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen The plot the way it develops the acting the portrayal of every human emotion and the ending makes  of movies seem like just a waste of time I didnt see it until a few years after it came out My sister said it was a great movie It was on HBO so I watched it I was speechless I have always found it strange that it was from a Steven King novel Ive read a few not that one and what comes through in the movie doesnt seem like anything that would be in a Steven King novel A better movie may come along but it may be a while,Positive
This movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life It is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap even when all your life has crumbled over your face hope is still your last hopeOne night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped What would you have done had you been in his shoes keep on hoping Well Andy not only had hope he gave hope to his fellow prisoners The brilliant Morgan Freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and if he werent in this movie the movie would have lacked something for sureThere are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and I have commented on hundreds of movies but very few I gave the full  out of  and this movie is one of those few,Positive
you cant get more from a motion picture Morgan Freeman undoubtedly is a great actor and finding him as supporting actor in movies has been a culture in the modern cinemaThe movie have a great plot the director did a great job concentration on the story have a solid field and the scope to keep you sticking to your chair the movie have such a dialogue delivery that you have to pause if you even blink your eyeShawshank Redemption as the title is tempting so is the movie the star cast is great the performance cant get better and criticizing the all the rules and regulations of the society challenging the so many other other things the movie becomes a legend to the todays actors enough war movies enough jail breaks you have seen in movies but its all inspiring all contributing to the society and the diamond to the industry and the milestone for the coming actors is this Tim Robbins performance is great as he lived the role and the eye stretcher movie shawshank redemption,Positive
"Awesome story
Great bgm
If you watch this you never waste your time",Positive
I just visited a prison museum in north China which was a real prison used in early s  This movie reminds me of horrible dark room sodomy and brutal corporal punishment that actually can happen to you in the jailWhether you are innocent or not once you are IN the jail You are all the same Your are finished But Andy DufresneTim Robbins is not With hope and his persistence he escaped from jail after  years Imagine to dig a big cement hole with the small stone hatchet AmazingWhere there is a will there is a way This movie is encouraging,Positive
"Another one of those overlong morally righton movies that never rises above average  saved only by the actingIts bleedingheart politics dignity of individual maintained in adverse conditions is playedout well enough but actually lacks any real dramatic tensionDufrane is a twodimensional character who seems to go through the drama by numbers  theres never any doubt that he will triumph in the end its only a matter of howTim Robbins has done many more interesting films than this one  try The Player or Bob Roberts if youre looking for dramamoral ambivalence and how they interactBasically there are a lot better prison films than this one  Jailhouse Rock for startersLike most Stephen King stories  quite prosaic There was a story in here somewhere but it got overinflated and somewhat lost along the way
One to watch on a rainy day when theres nothing better to do",Positive
I have been into movies since well I was  But after about  years I finally was lucky enough to come across this title I had a huge expectation when I started watching itHey it aint number  for show that much i can vouch for Well it took me a few minutes to get into it but well once i got engulfed it was just sheer pleasure and goosebumpsThe film revolves around the inmates of a prison and a NEW FISH accused of homicide joining the facultyThe film depicts How he changed their lives and helped them to realize and bring back the greatest gift of life taken away from them  The friendship the hardship the simplest joy the tragedies  the yearning for freedom in each breath has been brilliantly acted and directedThe movie makes you feel goodAfter watching it it makes you smile and strengthens your faith in humanityI am no critic but this movie made me happy ecstatic and I would love to rewatch it again and again so i would say go on watch it at once if you have not You will love it no matter what your taste in films are Because this film expresses humanity in each way possible And as a fellow human being you will love the emotions If you dont then well I will be a bit surprisedPS  was the year of Forrest Gump It took home all the awards Though it is a great film but in my opinion it remains only great while shawshank is one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all times Thank You,Positive
Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver performances worthy of cinematic heaven No where do we spot the intention of their performances only the gradual development of a friendship that transcends race age and social classThe line between guilty and innocent although blurred amongst the inmates is animated by the corrupt guards and the abysmal treatment of men who have sand piles on their weary shouldersRedemption is the predominate theme as well as perseverance and friendship through situation Biblical undertones pervade Robbins bears oppression that angers the viewers until the redemptive secret is revealedThe institution the jail as metaphor for society often succeeds The instituional man cannot survive beyond the social structure behind the walls He is a lost soul without the community of thieves and murderers that defines his existence What is a man but a success amongst his peers One of the best films of the twentieth century,Positive
This is without a doubt one of the finest films of the last  years I think that if it had been released with more fanfare and didnt have such great competition that year it might have won for Best Picture This film has such a powerful presence that it has a life of its own apart from the cast score cinematography etc all of which are deservedly great This is one of those movies that you can switch to when you are channel surfing and stop and watch the rest of it no matter what part of the movie you are at Perhaps The Godfather and Jaws are a couple of others that do that for me and it never gets old no matter how many times you watch it One thing that disappoints me regarding this film is what has happened to the director Frank Darabont Unfortunately he has never come close to achieving the greatness of Shawshank with his subsequent films I thought The Green Mile was good but it didnt hold a candle to Shawshank I was also very disappointed in The Mist I sincerely hope that he is able to recapture some of the magic of Shawshank Redemption in a future film because he definitely does have the proved ability to do so,Positive
This is the only movie got  stars from me Although there are many great movies that deserve  stars I had to make this movie special and give  stars only to The Shawshank Redemption The best movie ever made so farThere is something very special about this movie that I cannot even describe It just affects you deeply and you start having hopes The acting is perfect The story is told very good and progressively gives you excitement It has a heartwarming end despite the all the sad stories that are told during the movie This movie will stay as the best movie of all time It deserves to be in the first place because the throne is only for kings It cannot be shared,Positive
like The Shawshank RedemptionThe Green Mile is another case of a Stephen King story which translates well from the page to the screenas in Milethis movie is also directed by Frank Darabontwho also wrote the screenplayanother similarity is the prison setting and the fact that the movie is seen and told through the eyes of one man Morgan Freemanwho just happens to be a prison lifer and the things he sees as the years go byhe tells the story of one man who becomes a prisonerTIm Robbins and who he becomes friends withthe movie then chronicles their friendship and struggles in the prison systemunlike The Green Milethere is no mystical or supernatural element to this filmhoweverthis film is of the same calibre of Mileowing to its solid writing acting and directionShawshank is very dramaticyet very compellingits also a very moving taleit will likely impact you emotionally and intellectually and before i forgeti must also mention the endingwhich i thought was very strongfor meThe Shawshank Redemption is a strong ,Positive
Im a big Stephen King fan and I wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation Some of Kings work has been great on film but others have not translated well No fear As others have noted this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity The script is great the directing is wonderful and the performances are unbelievably good To give you some idea of just HOW GOOD this is the first time I saw it was on an airline Problem was the headset didnt work and there werent any other headsets The movie is so good that I couldnt stop watching itand this is a movie heavy on dialogue If youve never seen it do yourself a favor NOTE Its even better with the sound,Positive
I know that other peoples votes shouldnt influence mine either waybut geez No of all time What are the IMDb demographics that create that overblown resultI thought this was a very entertaining movie somewhere around  points But the script is kind of sugary and the characters lack the subtlety you would expect in a truly great drama The ending reminded me of The Great EscapeThere are several good performances that arent quite able to shake loose the limitations of the script and become stirringCute but not the greatest prison drama ever I think there must be a lot of teenagers voting on IMDb,Positive
I always heard that this movie was good so I decided to check it out And I gotta say I was quite impressed The tone characterization screenplay etc are all fantastic Is it the best movie of all time Tough call But it is one of the few movies I can say is  stars,Positive
Is a timeless masterpiece that captures the essence of human resilience hope and the power of connection Set against the backdrop of a prison the film takes viewers on an emotional journey exploring profound themes that resonate universallyFrank Darabonts direction brings an intimate yet grand vision to life blending a compelling narrative with stunning visuals The performances are extraordinary with the lead actors delivering subtle yet deeply impactful portrayals of their characters The pacing is perfect allowing every moment to breathe and every scene to leave a markThe films ability to inspire and uplift even in the face of despair is what makes it a standout Combined with a beautiful musical score and thoughtful cinematography it is an unforgettable experience that stays with you long after the credits rollIf youre looking for a movie thats both thoughtprovoking and emotionally moving The Shawshank Redemption is a mustwatch Its a story that reminds us of the strength of the human spirit and the enduring power of hope,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly the best best movie ever The Oscars biggest mistake was giving Forrest Gump the awards that Shawshank deserved Not to take credit from Forrest Gump which is also an amazing movie but it just cant compare to Shawshank Morgan Freeman arguably delivers his best performance and Tim Robbins gives a performance that I feel is greatly underrated and also deserved an Oscar nomination The films art direction adds to the storys beauty and gives off a feeling that fills you with hope I remember seeing The Shawshank Redemption on sale for  at WalMart and thinking I heard this is good so I bought it Little did I know the film was worth more than gold I bought the film and put off watching it for a couple weeks not overly anticipating watching it but finally decided to watch it when I was bored I am a gigantic movie buff and have so many movies its almost pathetic but The Shawshank Redemption changed my entire view of film Now every time I watch a movie I cant help but think It cant beat Shawshank Some people say that this movie is overrated but thats wrong Shawshank is an actual work of art to be compared with works of DaVinci and Picasso When people say this movie makes them cry they dont mean to say its so sad but that they didnt know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen I believe that if everybody sees only one movie during their life it should be this one See it now After that IMDb will seem like a whole new website because every film will seem like a different movie It is by the very definition of the word magnificent,Positive
I have seen this movie a few times Each time with the same hope and enthusiasm as before The main story is obviously Andys His fears his hopes and dreams his struggle to remain sane As a rock hammer Andy chisels the prison around him But this is more than the story of Andy and his way out of prison Its a tale of society men trying to survive trying to remain human and civilized Red is a gentleman masterfully played by on of the greatest actors ever His character adds depth to the story and makes room for hope for friendship All those around Andy benefit from his morals his intelligence his perseverance his will not to let go of himself At first we see men with no hope no way out of their walls Brooks is an unfortunate part of it But Andy changes lives Some study some begin to plan life outside the walls Even the guards look up to a man as righteous as they come Every time I see it I get the same warm feeling as the first time I saw it without actually knowing what it was what it is Its only fitting it sits on top of the charts and if that makes people watch it its just enough as it will bring them the same feeling again and again I movie to watch once a year or whenever you need a little pickmeup,Positive
Hi I heard details about this movie first time two years ago from a friend Before that in some movie channels I used to see the title been shown but never saw it A jail movieslownot for meI was in college those days in the nineties In  when my friend told me that whenever he feel sad or down he thinks of this movie and moves on I replied back for me its rocky he asked if I have seen it and when I told him that I did not the only answer he had was itwatch it and then compare it Now in  with the recession going on lots of trouble in work and tensions of home and personal life for me While changing channels I chanced upon this movie which had started and I had lost some ten minutes I did not change the channels later and saw it in complete The only reaction was tears in my eyes in the end and called my family and close friends It was a shaking experience and I got my answerI needed to get out of my jail I sent mails to my friends about the movie and review few had seen it already and many did not Result more people watched itand guess what I for the first time rated in this website for the movie AND i expect some of my friends also did it This is the reason why after  years this movie is still alive because of its human spirit storywith more followers than fans I hope that answers some of your doubts This movie is for those who are busy dyingand now know its important to get busy living,Positive
Cons The movies pacing is slowthough it fits the tone and plot That said its not quite deserving of the top spot in the greatest films of all time rankings The Godfather has earned that title hands downIts also a missed opportunity not seeing Red with the harmonica That wouldve added something extra As for the Brooks storyline it drags on unnecessarily a few minutes wouldve sufficedPros On the plus side the film exceeds expectations especially with its plot twists Every scene sets up one thing then delivers something entirely differentkeeping you engagedThe ending Its one of the few that actually sticks the landing The Shawshank Redemption nails itThe final act really takes the intensity up a notch making it an exciting finishFinal verdict an  out of  Not quite a  but its still a solid pick,Positive
This is certainly a good movie with universal themes of freedom and adversity etc etc but Ive seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one There is nothing revolutionary in the directing The novella by Stephen King is practically tailormade for a movie adaption and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it I think the only reason this movie is  on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted The other truly great movies near the top of the list dont pack the same mass audience appeal that Shawshank Redemption does nor are they shown on TNT  times a year Movies like  The Seven Samurai or Lawrence of Arabia for example would bore many of the people who love Shawshank Redemption and I personally consider those three I named and many others to be far better creations than the Shawshank Redemption Perhaps we should take a poll of TNT viewers on the best movie of all time  Id bet Shawshank Redemption would place first with The Blues Brothers coming in a close second,Positive
Watching this movie was a pleasure the acting was outrageously good A film without special effects and action every  minutes just men in prison All I can say is I would have loved this film to have been longerThe acting from Morgan Freeman is second to none he proves in this film why he is regarded as one of the greatest actors to grace our screens Anyone who hasnt seen this film needs too watch it straight after reading this review as it will change your opinion on a lot of other films,Positive
The first time I saw this movie I loved it But I loved it more and more every time I saw it again If you want to have a good and entertaining time watching a movie buy this movie,Positive
Over the last  years I have watched this movie potentially hundreds of times This has become my go to movie when I am in need of some kind of reflection in my life This movie helped me survive some of my own darkest hours with the common theme of hope Hope is a good thingI can not understate how important this movie is to me Thank you so much for producing this film Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman Bob Clancy Will thank you in making this particular movie one of the best of all timesNearly every single part of this movie can be related to different parts of our lives our struggles our triumphs Thank you once again for the making of this fantastic movie,Positive
I cant figure out how a man could think such an outrageous concept like thatIts just beneath all the beautiful thingThanks to Frank DrabountMorgan FreemanTime RobbinsExcellency is sky high in this filmNot a movieits just a lifetime experienceSometimes people felt to sad they curse themselvesregret for everything they have done in lifeThey crush for successrun after moneyButhere is the thing that changes everything and it is indeed The HopeNo matter how bad you feelno matter how hard the path of the life isthe show is still goes on if you have just one thing and that is The HopeLife would certainly changes if peoples take the deep meaning of this wonderfully executed movieProbably It will help many people to start their life for the second timeHats off to everyone who worked with the Shawshank Redemption Team,Positive
"It was shocking to know initially that this masterpiece was not accepted by audience when it was releasedWell it was too ahead of its timeIt shows real character development of
Reda unwise hothead kid to a wise man who accepted his wrong doingWhat I like the most
was its ability to tell an extraordinary story in a very pleasant and simple appealing wayI like the simplicity of the storytelling processIts a masterpiece no doubt in itIts a great story",Positive
Saying this is the  movie of alltime is like saying McDonalds makes the best hamburgers Theyre both palatable predictable inoffensive products that are easy to digest Both have happy endings that is if you find the stunning speed with which a McDonalds hamburger flushes out your digestive tract to be a happy occasionAll you need to know is that Shawshank has the exact same ending as Trading Places So why not make Trading Places the greatest comedy of alltime What the hell why not make it  on IMDb It too is competent and utterly middleofthe road in terms of quality and originality within its genreInstead of Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy laughing it up on a Caribbean beach after besting the forces of evil we get Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins Its the exact same ending Shawshank was OK when I saw it when it came out But count me among the backlash group that would rather see it with the  rating that it deserves Thusly I hereby cast my symbolic star vote,Positive
The best movie I have ever seen in my entire life This will be a movie that will live on through history,Positive
