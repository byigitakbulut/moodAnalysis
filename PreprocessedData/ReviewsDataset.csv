Back to the movie clearly the actors are first rate and the dialog is entertaining I particularly enjoy the incarnation of The Joker by Heath Ledger which may bring Heath a posthumous Oscar nod the writers give him some clever lines like the you complete me phrase in the above quote from Jerry MaGuire But you know what Im not buying Im not buying that this Batman flick because of its dark humor is better than other comicbookinspired movies aside from the rare Joker line nothing in this movie is humorous dark or otherwise In fact its uncommonly depressing I suppose Knight is similar to the later Spider Man films in which were to solemnly consider the deep emotional conflicts presented to a postpubescent boy who has been given superhuman powersMy friends these are movies and movie advocates that take themselves way too seriously For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews please visit my site TheCoffeeCoastercomBrian Wright Copyright ,Positive
So simple dont do like me and waste  years saying meh Ill watch it anothertime just watch it when you find it You will enjoy it,Positive
Okay lets say this from the word goShawshank Redmeption might as well be called Fantasy Island visits Alcatraz  Lets just see how many shopworn prison movie cliches the picture has  A corrupt warden   Brutal guards   Homosexual gang attacks at least not in a shower   Innocent man sent to jail has a journey of self discovery   All illiterate convicts speak flawless english and spout witty phrases   No racial tension in fact no blacks with any character except Morgan Freeman doing a version of the kindly butler from a Shirley Temple pictureafter all it appears all he is there for is to be the witty sidekick and supply cigarettes and pictures of scantily clad women   A black man runs the illegal smuggling into the prison   Nobody in jail is bad or even seems like they could be violent they are all a bunch of happy go lucky working class stiffs  I guess this means we should be able to identify with rapists and murderers as they are just like usa chilling thought   Nobody except the hero ever attempts an escape or seems to want to escape  Over use of metaphors such as rain as a metaphor of washing himself clean of his past and putting on a new lifeI am not saying that all prison films have to be a version of Scared Straight but come on this is clearly a fantasy prison and the very unreality of it undercuts anything the movie might be trying to say  The Shawshank Redemption is in this reviewers eye nothing more than another holier than thou morality play packaged as gritty realism all because it is based in a prisonhohum,Positive
Inception is a highly overrated film But its still solid and I would recommend it potentially based on the viewerThere are many reasons to dislike Inception a lack of emotional depth huge pacing issues predictability and an overemphasis on the concept of shared dreams rather than the plotLet us be honest the characters are rather dull And the film is so overly complex it thinks its the next Matrix its not its no where near as good Visually Inception is stunning and Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as always but this does not excuse the poor plot the music is good however Confusing forgettable but has moments of brilliance Most likely if someone says its a  theyre likely just following the crowd,Positive
The target audience for this movie would be anyone under  Kids enjoyed it but it was just meh for me Basically about the main character not fitting in with the traditional norms just be yourself,Negative
Originally I wrote a very long review of Shawshank Redemption but ive decided not to post it  Instead id just like to say that i would compare the movie to a poem that i wrote in th grade  im not going to write the poem out because i dont have it with me right now but it had to do with rainbows and waterfalls and following your dreams In other words it was complete bs I just wrote what i thought were some typical poetic themes and threw them together hoping people would like it  My plan succeeded the teacher thought it was the best in the class and it got published in the school newspaper Seems like the director of The Shawshank Redemption Frank Darabont and the writer of the book Stephen King did the same thing  The movie is technically well made and does succeed at telling the story  I admit that I got caught up in the ending  But no matter how much you try to defend it its still pure Hollywood  Cliche here and there  I recognize this for what it is  a directors attempt to manipulate peoples emotions which due to a large amount of naivite in the world succeeds  He did the same thing with The Green Mile with more success  Now with The Majestic I am glad to see that it seems that most reviewers and many moviegoers have recognized this and given it generally lower reviews than his first two films  Finally  Now I only hope people will start to give Shawshank lower ratings and get it down from the heights of the top  list,Positive
Great acting of JokerSalute to him The best storyline ever watched Great directionperfect for action user and the best movie i have seen this is the great movie so watch it and enjoy it very muchbest of luck for this great movieyou will like it and make it yours favorite and add it in your watch list enjoy rate it great acting great direction great performance great showdown great villain great hero i like it very much the best movie i have seen i will watch it again and again and enjoy it very much i have give it  stars and i if there were  stars option i will give  out of  i prefer you to watch it and enjoy it very much as you can,Positive
It was a wonderful experience to watch Heath Ledgers Final performance on the big screen The film was fantastic along with the film techniques shown especially the interrogation scene The film itself is an is an extraordinary experience It will keep you glued to your seat as you take in what Nolan had to offer its audience All the actors especially Heath Ledger as the Joker are an unforgettable I am pretty sure the rest that going to view the film or have already seen it will agree Although not a masterpiece it belongs to be with the best films in history Id be shocked if Heath is not nominated for an Oscar or any other film related Oscars such as Sound or Cimenitography this film is a well notable film to be considered an Epic,Positive
I love movies and this is the first movie i fell asleep to cause it was that boring omg they never spoke a single word for the first  minutes all they did was dance and sing and i didnt really get the concept of the movie James cordon and rebel wilson were so funny tho other than that the movie really sucked and its a one star for me,Negative
This was such a great movie I loved every second of it The animation was of high quality and voice acting was sentimental and good Really looking forward to a second part,Negative
The Dark Knight is the peak of cinema and if you disagree this is at least the peak of cinema for DC Joker is absolutely iconic and has some good jokes but you cant help but feel that he is a true threat With the previous movie in the trilogy the villain had certain goals to cleanse society they werent completely immoral Heath Ledgers Joker stops at nothing His goal is to make chaos and as a great butler once said Some people just want to watch the world burn which is perfect description for this character testing to see how even merely mentions of his future actions can drive the world into a craze,Positive
With this much money and this many iconic actors coming back you would think they could make something good What a complete  from the original movie It was just sad watching all of the new Jurassic series I wish the would start making movies like they used to Take risks hire people based on talent START with an excellent story Anyway do not watch this movie is you care about good story and good film making This movie was just sad and hard to watch It was all just pointless It was all just boring You didnt care Colin Trevor needs to stop being allowed to make movies He is probably one of the worst directors in the industry,Notr
I dont understand how any human being can rate this movie  stars Even if its the first movie you ever watched and cant compare it to any other movie how can you think its excellent movie The acting is terrible the animations are amateurish the plot is predictable and boring and some of it also makes no sense It was a complete waste of my time I was amaze to discover that the movie as a connection to marvel and to spiderman worldI hope for the good of all humanity they dont make a sequel I will support World War III just to prevent it Everyone associated with the film should feel embarrassed,Notr
This was probably the biggest disappointment in a film of my life It would of easily rivaled other movies based off classic toys and TV shows if it had a better director and was less corny All they had to do was make it pg and they would have been able to take out all of the parts that you actually feel embarrassed to watch and add fight scenes that were a little more graphic and realistic The acting was a little shotty in places but with a storyline this bad it wouldnt matter who was in it The worst part though was easily put on the director and producers Whether it was the obviously fake backgrounds or the fact that they developed and showed how the characters were so badly Overall they should try Dragonball Z again but should put on a little bigger budget,Negative
This movie is possibly one of the worst animated movies I have ever watched Whenever they cracked a joke it literally made me so uncomfortable that I was squirming in my seat with an upset stomach Nothing about this movie was original and the depictions of kids nowadays is entirely inaccurate Its almost as if the producers did no research whatsoever during production Warning if you watch this your mental health is at stake,Negative
They almost destroyed dragon ball I can just watch the first  minutes Everything is wrong in the movie I dont know where the  million went to Ive seen better effects in non budget amateur movies Goku a teenager Are we crazy Gokus never been a teenager Goku never went to school either And who decided to take out Krillin Whatever this could be minor problems if everything else was OK but is not the case Boring direction cinematography and art direction They just wanted some money and they made the movie without watching or reading anything of dragon ball Hollywood is having a bad time that proves itIn conclusion this isnt a movie is an abortion Well just have to wait until Fox takes this project to someone with a brain this could take  years,Negative
"I regret wanting to watch this movie when I was younger Since I watched it more I came to conlusion that this movie is corny in many ways
 Goku being an angsty teen is unfitting and this would fit Gohan more Minust angsty part Special effects are awful
 Voice acting is boring Writing in general gives me gonorrheaJust watching the rest of the movie feels like MKUltra psyop done by people who want to experiment on others to see their breaking pointIf you want to check out Dragon Ball franchise just read mangas or watch animeAvoid this at any cost I am too bored to give this movie a rating",Negative
Easily one of the best comic book films ever made Bale isnt great as BruceBat but his acting is on par However Heaths joker isnt an Oscar legend for no reason One of the best portrayals of a character of l time Up there with James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano,Positive
This movie was a massive dissapointment for the ages This movie looked like a movie that chopped up to get it as short as possible This cut is terrible and the CGI needs to be redone Sony has no soul and needs to do these characters right,Notr
This is like a movie you will enjoy if you turn off your brain for whole movie There is a lot of plotholes lots of things that is not really making any sense irl But i do like dinosaur so ill gave this a rather good review since i think of this movie better than another movie that just try to be serious but end in zonk I do like the funny iconic trex walk i find lots of scene here funny and laugh a lot because of this movie Its done its purpose of recreation The plot is so dramatic its amusing and funny I dont hate this movie but for real the dinosaurs really is not accurate If you want to enjoy turn off your brain for whole  hours lol D,Notr
This movie is simply amazing I loved every part of it Especially the poop jokesJust kidding The whole movie is a great big pile of Patrick Stewart When I wasnt cringing     Oh wait I cringed through the entire movie I mean the plot revolves around meh That is very risky and they blew it Do not watch this movie Not in the theaters not on redbox not even on Netflix where I saw it It wastes time money or both,Negative
I went into the cinema to see this film with sky high expectations given the domestic and international reviews of it Phrases like modern classic and landmark film made me think that I was in for something truly special in terms of film history along the lines of Citizen Kane and The GodfatherTurns out I wasnt well not all the way anyway I wont bother with the whole plot line since its very sprawling and complicated but suffice it to say that my main disappointment with the film stems from the fact that the thematics of the story simply are too limited and ordinary compared to the potential impact of the films gimmick the fact that you can enter somebodys dream to steal information or plant ideasThe plot revolves mainly around industrial espionage a theme which simply does nothing for me emotionally Who cares if one industrial tycoon wants to stop another The dream concept of the film is truly magical and innovative and is a very compelling feature of the film itself But why in heavens name marry it to something as pointless as industrial espionage What happened to something like the fight for world domination It would have given the film infinitely more punch if the plot had centered around some political intrigue in stead Especially given the unstable nature of the world today with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan huge climate issues and so forthThe subplot involving Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillards characters to me comes off very flat their on screen chemistry not being very strong This is a shame for the premise of the subplot has great emotional potentialAll in all somewhat of a disappointment despite the wallop one inevitably receives from the films take on the concept of entering someone elses dreams,Positive
This movie is awesome Besides jacks films I know nobody including my friends who think this movie is good Why People just say the movie is bad without saying anything about the movie that is bad The movie is funny and James Corden does a great job at voicing  I love this movie and highly recommend it ,Negative
This is the Best Superhero movie Ive ever seen It even introduced me to Christopher Nolan and thus I watched Inception and Interstellar two of the best stories Ive ever seen And also Christian Bale his performance is most definitely the best Dark Knight performance out there,Positive
I HATED the musical on stage when I saw it in  There was little plot most of the songs sucked and I was bored The movie has some of these issues but I ended up sort of liking it The makeup on the people wasnt that bad and everybody could sing act and dance Also there was some startling set designsit certainly LOOKED great I almost did walk out about  minutes in when a number with singing mice and tapdancing cockroaches Im not kidding started up but I stayed It got much better after that Most of the songs were unmemorable but I loved Mr Mistoffelees and of course Memory Also Jennifer Hudson was superb in her role She sang Memory so beautifully I started crying So its not a great movie but its certainly not the bomb people are saying it is,Negative
Terrible wish I could rate it zero stars They changed what the musical was originally about,Negative
I can not believe Hollywood even decided to make a live action of this movie to begin with The cast do not do justice to the animation Why cast a white person to be Japanese Thats extremely presumptuousThis is also one of those movies where its solely about special effects No real story and lack of character development I loved the animation and for them to rip the story apart is greatly disappointing I nearly fell asleep watching this junk Save your time and money and go buy the animated series insteadHollywood clearly ran out of ideas recently and are looking to profit from any idea Highly disappointed by this movie  avoid,Negative
When I saw how much hate The Emoji Movie was getting I decided I had to see it for myself to see if it was justified An animated kids film with a sizeable budget couldnt possibly be that bad right Wrong It is every bit as bad as the reviews suggestThis is by far and away the worst animated movie I have ever seen It has literally nothing going for it with everything from the plot to the script and characters being nothing short of dreadful As if the idea itself isnt bad enough they then have the audacity to stuff it full of product placement It angers me to think that people actually went to the cinema to see what is effectively a  minute long advertThe Emoji Movie is just another example of a pitiful Hollywood cash grab jumping on a social trend to make a quick buck It is insulting even to the young children it is supposed to please The worst film of the year by far,Negative
"Today was actually Batman dayliterally so they had this movie on TV
I saw it and liked it
The Dark Knight is well put together for any movie  Great acting from Bale and Ledger
Hans Zimmers soundtrack will keep you on your feet
As always  Nolans direction is as quirky as it getsThough I am not a fan I pretty much enjoyed it  I guess you will too if you are into superheroes",Positive
"Just a few points
Studios clearly too involved in the film feels like the films missing an hourShould have stayed a horror film as it was leaning into during the beginning but then just dropped it for an action movieCharacter has no real downside to ability especially compared to his comic originsThe action is a jumbled cgi mess of random slomos and distortion effectsR rated would have given ability to save this mess but studios chickened out",Notr
Perhaps the best movie I have ever seen Beautiful cinematography sharp writing deep character progression and most importantly a masterclass of acting Morbius is a brilliant concoction of all of the cornerstones of filmmaking If you have not seen Morbius  you are a loser and  you should go see MorbiusIts MORBIN TIME,Notr
Hiiii just finished watching the movie inception and i need to share my emotions with you after watching it Best film ever that i watched It was one of the best movies Ive ever seen Before seeing the film I read that the director was Christopher Nolan and the protagonist Leonardo Di caprio so I already knew it was wonderful Without spoilers I want to make you understand a bit of what its about is an action and thriller film lasting  hours and  minutes Talks about Dominic Cobb is a professional who takes care of extracting secrets from peoples minds while they sleep infiltrating their dreams through a special device that allows a group to participate in a shared dream Cobb and his team normally use tricks and deceptions to steal information from the victim who he believes to be in reality and suspects nothing Together with his partner Arthur tries to enter the mind of Mr Saito a powerful Japanese businessman to perform an extraction but fails when the dream projection of Mal dead wife of Cobb appears in the dream interfering with the operation I advise you to look at it very carefully otherwise you will not understand the ending well I think it is one of the best films of  because it differs from the others it is not monotonous in the plot and you can see that the director has perfected every detail in order to make it fascinating and moving I wait for you to see it and leave a personal comment,Positive
The first time I saw this film I said those three words a lot to my friends and family Shawshank Redemption is the BEST FILM I have ever seen in my lifetime I have seen tons of films Morgan Freeman gave a performance that will touch anyones heart From beginning to end this film shows how films should be made,Positive
Is a clear example of what happens when a project without ideas a lot of money is put For someone who watched the anime is insulting what they did with the story until the time comes that it is impossible finish the movie For those who have not seen the anime is a remix of teen movie ill conceived adventure heroes and villains unconvincing underdeveloped A watchable movie for children under  but if necessary it is better to make them see the original anime before this shame I could write endless tube faults the movie not only in history thats the worst that can happen to a fan of Dragon Ball but the script also poorly developed the actions run down and address unintelligible but it would be a waste of time It is best to pretend that the movie never existed,Negative
Choppy and lack of character development Protagonist vs Antagonist storyline that does not make sense Jared Leto is a great actor but even he cant carry this movie This played like it was written by a  year old child,Notr
This is awesome Never expected there would be another matrix movie I loved this movie and I would so love to see them make more If you are a fan then you will enjoy this,Notr
You cant blame people behind animations animations are great you cant blame voice characters but you can and should blame the worst screenplay ever This is horrible I have no idea can emoji movie be filmed in a different way but I know for a fact they have found and chose the worst way possible The movie is not funny or maybe it is for babies from  years old to  years old any older kids will vomit watching this This movie should be as an example for Film students how to not make a movie I cant think of any reason why they made this movie but yeah maybe thats why they made this movie to show students how to make worst movies ever Any Oscars for worst movie ever,Negative
"I recommend watching this movie only if you have too much grey matter and want to fry some of it off I could hear my brains cells dying during the movie a feeling I havent had since Sex and the City  
This movie is dumber than Sex and the City  that says it all",Negative
This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion from haunting and chilling to stirring and beautiful When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry music and its atmosphere and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction it is a triumph Truly a masterpiece,Negative
Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freemans Ellis Redding Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen Kings short story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption in the film version its really Raquel Welch not Rita who aids in the ultimate twist On the surface its another prisongenre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden a cruel guard a few homosexuals and a quirky oldtimer who doesnt want his parole However the films emotions run surprisingly deep justice is well served by the conclusion and several of the cast members carve out amazing threedimensional characterizations The finale is pure fantasy however it does provide the audience with the release it needs and Robbins and Freeman are excellent Long involved but engrossing and satisfying Shawshank was not a big hit at the boxoffice but found a devoted following on video and cable  from ,Positive
Acting is perfect Storyline is fantastic Overall an incredible instalment in the Batman trilogy,Positive
I have seen this update to the Matrix franchise  times and i understand why there are such low ratings First it takes  minutes to get cooking second its another femcentric film which i have no problem with there is a formulaic feel to all the fight scenes and keanu just wasnt there for this one All in all as a stand alone film it was thrilling to watch but also a let down,Notr
If youve ever wondered what would happen if you took a beloved highenergy anime and stripped away everything that made it iconic Dragon Ball Evolution has your answer The film feels less like an adaptation and more like a rough draft of a generic teen action movie that someone vaguely themed around Dragon Ball at the last minuteThe characters barely resemble their originals Goku is reduced to an awkward highschooler Piccolo looks like he escaped from a Halloween store clearance bin and the script seems determined to avoid anything that might actually excite longtime fans The fight scenes are bland the CGI already looked dated when the movie released and the tone wobbles between unintentional comedy and outright confusionIt purely earns its place as one of the worst adaptations of an anime because it is technically a movie with a beginning middle and end But as a Dragon Ball adaptation Its a catastrophe of missed potential questionable choices and outright misunderstandings of what made the franchise special,Negative
Best movie ive seenThis movie  years on is still first class,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption came out in  and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video peaking as the most rented video of  in the USA A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of RedMorgan Freeman and Andy Tim Robbins Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance where the human spirit eventually prevails The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast The score is deep and haunting this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart To me it is the best film of the s and quite possibly one of the best of all timeThe fact that this film is sitting at No is a testament to just how many people love this film many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film and I dont blame them I only wish that I could view the film for the first time again and experience that redeeming feeling Andy and Red experienced at the endIgnore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience the last half hour are especially beautiful Watch this if you already havent and enjoy the masterpiece that Frank Darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing ,Positive
At one point in the movie they were facing the firewall It was a pit bull song where it says Im a fireball when it clearly shouldve been Im a firewallOverall the movie was meh,Negative
I think the film is overrated i dont like it too much,Positive
I am stingy when it comes to awarding  points for a movie but in this case I have no choice Have seen quite a bit of movies over the last  years but none of them ever incited me to discuss it with my friends or even if they did not the way inception is doing nowPeople rave about avatar but other than the fancy graphics the storyline was very bland None of thats going to happen with inception From the start right till the end it will keep you wondering as to what might come next Makes you think as well You dont have to be super smart to understand the movie An average person will surely absorb it pretty decentlyLeo has been amazing as always Hes a brilliant actor probably the best currently Nolan and leo both deserve Oscars for what they have achieved here Levitt has been damn good The last I saw of him was in  days of summer Was pleasantly surprised to see him in a mature role Not sure about Ellen Page Nothing in her role made me say wow shes damn good She was okay Ken Watanabe was decent Tom Hardy was good I liked the way he portrayed being a more seriousjovial kind of person as opposed to how Levitt is especially allI am damn happy for watching the firstdayfirstshow for this movie Planning to go down and watch it again tomorrow Worth every extra penny i am spending on it ,Positive
I know everybody is saying how lame this movie is and that its nothing like the animethat everyone was out of character and that it generally suckedBut I beg to differThis movie is based on the graphic novelBASED ONso its supposed to be almost nothing like the movieI hate how everyone thinks that a live action movie of a manga is supposed to contain every single detailbut its almost impossible to get all that information in an hour and a half movieSo what do you do You make your own story so it can fit the timeIf the lord of the rings movies or harry potter movies contained all the details of the book then the movies would be  hour plus movies I thought it was an awesome movieIt didnt portray the actual mangabut it fits more the profile of a tribute to Dragonball So summed up this movie was a TRIBUTE,Negative
I saw this movie to see how bad it was and it was a terrible terrible mistake This movie is basically what would happen if you put Inside Out Wreck it Ralph crap garbage and an iPhone in a blender then put it it in the oven took out the result nuke it then put the ashes back in the oven and the emoji movie comes out Do not watch this movie Ever,Negative
OK no offense but to everyone saying this is stupid and who came up with this stupid idea  this world is dead Etc we are the world and we are the future if you think this movie sucked than do something about it and start using your creativity and change the future I thought it was OK for kids it was innocent,Negative
Its not as bad as I expected but its still pretty bad The humor is pretty crappy literally The romance is cringeinducing at best The plot is predictable and the characters boring The only redeeming quality the movie has is that its pretty short I would not watch this movie ever again and I would not recommend this cesspool of a movie to anyone,Negative
The story is just another below average although the few actors are good The special effect is just average but the stunts are poorDirectorship is below average this timeThe story should be rewritten because too common nothing exciting The director also did not make it good enough to be excitedI cannot give high due to the dropped standard from previous series The most is  only This is just another average movie nothing to get really excite and not worth top pay watch in cinema I only recommend to watch at home with a small charges if you are a fan,Notr
This movie is well ok Because if its lack of story and the action is Acceptable I give it  stars I feel like marvelor Sony is just trying to add more Villains for spiderman to have The acting is decent The cgi can get a bit shakey at some points but other than that it is ok The story moves very quickly and I felt like I was just thrown into a scenario that I had no background knowledge of Some good things about this movie though is the final battle Which has decent cgi but still it was kinda disappointing The thing that made me want to see more was the ending But yeah This movie gets  stars out of ,Notr
I dont normally leave reviews but in this case I couldnt resist there is so much hate on this film I grew up on seeing cats at London theatre and loved it this was a good representation of cats the ending was a bit weird Definitly worth a watch if you like the original cats,Negative
This is the worst movie Ive ever seen in my life,Negative
Flat out one of the best movies Ive ever watched Had plot action acting and was all put together perfectly Christian Bale was amazing and of course Heath had one of the best acting performances of all time Christopher Nolan is such a gifted director able to make this movie one of the best oat A must watch,Positive
Where do I even begin with this film The writing is just a rip off of other better movies characters are unlikeable the animation looks so cheap,Negative
I dont easily remember the names of actors of Hollywood movies neither do I ever take the time off writing comments on any movie but for this movie i have to do it allThe whole way of presenting this movie has been outstanding ie from the beginning to the end Great performances Tim Robbins  Freeman Qualifying as one my favorite actors The whole presentation has been very apt to the movie But what is important is the strong message this movie transcends ie of Hope is truly recommendableThis movie deserves an intent watch by all Do take you some time off to watch the movieif not twice be it once,Positive
There is no way Inception will be a bad movie because it was directed by Christopher Nolan There are many words to describe this movie and those are mindbending imaginative exciting overwhelming entertaining and awesome Inception might be the only movie this summer that has an original conceptInception is very unique and it is fresh to everybody The visuals were overwhelming The action scenes are awesome The CGI effects were realistic and eye candy The story is interesting and mindbendingThe performances were great Leonardo DiCaprio is still a great actor Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe are one of the best parts of the movie Cillian Murphy is disappointing though Joseph GordonLevitts performance is flawlessInception is mindbending and nonstop entertaining Once again Christopher Nolan made another successful blockbuster Inception might be the best movie of the year,Positive
Before watching Matrix Resurrections I watched Matrix Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions I also reread Platos Allegory of the Cave and commentary about knowing if we were shadow followers or notI watched Matrix Resurrections with an open mind and paid more attention to the dialogue I enjoyed the action and the special effects as well As I watch major themes of truth reality choice peace and love played out The questions posed throughout the movie will always be asked What are you looking for What do you want Who are youMatrix Resurrections provides answers to questions raised in the earlier movies and raises new questionsIn order to keep balance and harmony in the world we need to be engaged in dialogue with each other learning what reality is what truth is what peace is and what love isMatrix Resurrections provides a framework for us,Notr
Just the think of the professional cast and the high budget that was poured into this film made this joke even funnier  for making me laugh so strongYep Reviews on IMDB were right I needed to verify it myselfIts like watching a long commercial break with cats promoting different products and wishing the break will be over as soon as possibleFor  minutes its pretty funny After that not so much Laughs are replaced with a feeling of torture I would play this movie  times to my worst enemies,Negative
The Emoji Movie will go down in history of one of the worst things ever made but suprisingly Ive seen worse if you value your sanity never watch this,Negative
"The day after my friends showed me this movie at their house I considered suing them for reckless assualt of the senses and permanat loss of intelligence
The emoji movie is horrible in every single way Its themes ofemotionI guess make no sense the characters are litteraly are  demetional BY DESIGN the story has no stakes or direction filled to the brim with shameless product placement incredibly cringey unfunny creepy humor and forced writing that had us all yelling at the TV It all goes nowhere yet is still totally predictable What is this garbage
Its not even bad in a good way ie you can laugh at how bad it is Its a zero effort cash grab that proves holleywood can spit in our faces laugh take our money and suffer zero consiquence Stop seeing these types of movies even ironically Everyone who worked on this should be embarresed and ashamed of themselves",Negative
As a fiction writer I very much enjoy creating stories worlds and trying to keep everything tied together ITs a great challenge Christopher Nolan is a genius at creation His movies are groundbreaking and Inception is just another one of his phenomenal creationsThe first  minutes were tough to figure out but later you understand how those scenes were relevant to the story and the rest of it really wasnt that hard for me  it made sense The score was fantastic  I noticed that Nolan loves to infuse music into the film almost the whole time rather than in key moments It adds to the drama  I like itThe acting was very strong Leo is a talented actor and did his thing in this movie The rest of the cast was strong also but I dont know if any of them will win major awards  except maybe the exwife She was great Nolan used a couple of actors from the Batman movies in there  that was interestingOne flaw I could pick on was that it wasnt clear what anyone elses motivation was to finish the Inception job Clearly Leos character had a goal but I couldnt really tell why the others were so loyal and accommodating Maybe I missed the monetary reward offered The reality bend in Inception was done to perfection Rang very similar to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in that regardThe movie was gorgeous to look at The style was similar to his other recent films  and thats a very good thingAnd the ending What can I say it was one of the most satisfying endings Ive ever seen I walked out and just nodded my head Yep Very nice Extraordinarily well done film,Positive
Pretty disappointing I guess its just hard to come up with something as good as the original Either was sort of boring exposition or just some action that didnt do anything new All the slomo visual effects felt lazy blurry and cheap Like they just pushed a slowmo button but didnt do anything new like the original did Neo just had so little to do or say and even Trinity didnt have much going on either for being the centerpiece of the film Just Meh Id rather just go and watch the Original or even  before watching this one again Bummer,Notr
I absolutely love this movie I watch it on Netflix every day before I go to bed to have sweet dreams about all the characters Such an advanced and compelling story my mom loved this movie and bought me a whole bunch of merchandise Ive made so much fanart for this movie and the sick dance moves I got from the just dance scene When me and my fam go clubbing we got our sick Emoji Pop dance moves to flex on other people in da club This movie has made my life so much better Ill always have a crush on Gene The Emoji Thank you Sony I love you  ,Negative

Dragonball has been around for  years nowit has become a cultural icon and one of the popular things just like PokemonPower RangersYu GiOhetcPeople who love Dragonball can make a better movie than the terrible movie Dragonball EvolutionThe guy who plays as Goku Justin Chatwin seems like a miscast because his acting as Goku seems nothing like himTh movie seems like it was trying to make a movie franchise out of the movie and change a lot from Dragonball Like how Goku does not have a tailKrillin is not the best friend of Goku because the movie made him an outcastBulma has one small streak of hair to confirm she is BulmaGoku is madly in love with ChiChi even though in the show he doesnt know what being in love is likeand most of the characters and history in the movie is nothing like DragonballThis movie is definitely on the list for worst movies ever and worst adaptions ever,Negative
The movie is a  however one has to acknowledge the skills and hard work of those involved with creating this visual masterpiece The story wasnt much but I suspect the makers had a larger audience in mind considering schools out and kept it simple,Notr
Ive watch every jurassic movies  I love every movies but there is one problem that is same story I mean by putting og characters doesnt mean that this movie best ever Now  first I will talk about positive things  Nobody will gonna accept that it has very good VFX  it gives reallastic shot second new dinosaures and third that featuring kiddnapping of bluechild  Now  negitave weak polt  same story and predictable action and climax  So if you are interested to watch the flim  you can with your family and dont expect any new thing I am thinking that the makers wanted sequel or for timepass,Notr
DragonballEvolution is adaptation of a graphic novel made by Akira ToriyamaDragonball achieved worldwide glory as a cartoonbut the movie did not repeated the success of the cartoonWhyThe answer is pretty simpleMost of the people who have watched and reviewed this film are fans of the cartoonThis adaptation is not bad at allThe actingdirection and the script are pretty decentand special effects are very goodI think that if you have not watched the cartoon there are greater chances to like this movieIt is not very intelligentbut it can be decent entertainmentespecially for young boys who love the world of fantasy and actionFor adults it is recommended only if they want to escape from the real world into the world of fantasy,Negative
If cancerous memes were a film this would be that film Harambe Bad Luck Brian and that ermahgerd girl wouldnt look out of place in this film because all it is and could realistically ever be is an attempt at relatability and absolute filthy pandering to a younger audience than those who could possibly understand a hidden agendaIm pretty sure this film is a blockbuster classic in another universe one where Trump is a good man and Obama was born in Kenya Thats right Opposite Universe which is ironically a film I would rather watch than this crock of memedustI needed to take  scalding acid showers to forget this film and this review will cause me to take a couple moreEw,Negative
When Batman Begins was released in the year  I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of BatmanSo when I went to watch this movie I was ready to see the Heath Ledgers Joker cracking some jokes blowing up lots of places killing tons of people going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite He did blow up buildings he did kill people he did go insane and laugh but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to itIts been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledgers Joker completely stole the show Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true The movie grips you throughout its min runtime Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world put in a dark and serious movie and make it work Other actors also played their part well Christian Bale was good as BatmanBruce Wayne Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent Gary Oldman Maggie Gyllenhaal Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time For those of you who havent watched it yet I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely,Positive
This movie is garbage horrible nothing like the anime,Negative
If theres one movie Id recommend to anyone its The Shawshank Redemption This film is the perfect example of storytelling done right Its emotional gripping and leaves you thinking about it long after the credits roll Honestly its a solid  in my bookThe story revolves around Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins a banker who is wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife What follows is a tale of resilience friendship and hope in the bleakest of circumstances Morgan Freeman as Red the narrator and Andys closest friend in Shawshank delivers one of the most iconic performances ever His voice alone could carry the entire movie but paired with his acting its pure goldWhat really sets this film apart is its pacing and attention to detail Every scene feels purposeful and the way the plot unfolds keeps you hooked The bond between Andy and Red is so welldeveloped that you feel their highs and lows as if they were your own And the ending Its one of the most satisfying conclusions ever a perfect payoff for the journey youve just been taken onBeyond the incredible acting and plot the film has a deeper message about the power of hope and perseverance It shows how even in the darkest times the human spirit can shine through The dialogue is unforgettable who doesnt love the Get busy living or get busy dying line and the cinematography is stunning especially considering it was made in the sIf you havent watched it yet do yourself a favor and make it your next movie night pick Its not just a film its an experience,Positive
The best movie everNo wonder it sold more than one morbillion ticketsI especially liked the scene where Morbius said its morbin time or Lets morb it just show how well written the whole movie isAnd the cgi is perfect you cant tell if this morbius is cg or Jared Leto actually became a vampire,Notr
This movie was so utterly predictable it was a little painful Luckily the nostalgia nods were sprinkled throughout and mostly not forced You can tell they tried to have some funny oneliners which fell flat a lot of the time They need to take some notes from Marvel on those The CGI and action was as good as youd expect and offered favorable intensity The story itself was somewhat lazy IMO Did I mention it was totally predictable I left the theater goingmeh,Notr
This movie is like a bad twilight movie all over again The movie egged along and it was such a boring movie basically reminded me of a snooze fest The plot was boring and they waited way to long in the movie to reveal the villain which made it unenjoyable I said batman was not great but this takes icing on the cake for one of the worst movies ive seen in theaters,Notr
inception it begins with confusion the movie ends with standing ovationin between there is a dream of Nolan that bounds n mesmerizes you dark knight  batman begins n mementoare piece of fine craft but this movie brings Nolan in bracket of Cameroons Spielbergs n leanshope you enough iedream of Nolans master craft acting DiCaprios in lead enough said hans beats chills you out for this movie hope after inceptionit is only inception of further great works from NOLANOscar who gives a damncarry on but please make movie every year ,Positive
This film is redundantIt has nothing to sayIt looks like Matrix but isnt MatrixI like Keanu but what this film make me realise It wasnt because of Keanu Matrix was great Not in the slightest And I hate itThat being said the first part of the movie was entertaining It looked like something great was going to happen It didntOnly disappointment happened,Notr
Cash grab sequelPoor direction and scriptSet itself for more sequelsEdting and sound scape so soExtended use of st movie clips redundant Actingdirecting uninspired Stick with the original st oneNot recommended,Notr
This movie aint horrible but aint great Its just there This movie is quite predictable where Michael Morbius Jared Leto argues then later fights his best friend Milo Matt Smith because Morbius doesnt want to be a vampire hybrid while Milo accepts the affects of the serum Very cliche and predictable,Notr
Morbius starts off very average before falling off a cliff with a rushed CGI mess of a finale The movies one saving grace is Matt Smiths hammy performance as he glees it up as the villainous Milo The rest of the movie is one gigantic bore with Leto sleepwalking his way through the role The last  minutes come and go with little fanfare as it looks like it has just been cobbled together at the last minute There are  mid credit sequences but by the time they come you wont care enough to have any interest in it whatsoever Hopefully Jared Leto never meets Hardy or Holland Woeful attempt at Morbius,Notr
To the haters I say give it a few more watches to let the ideas sink in I found it exciting thoughtprovoking and emotionally satisfying Honestly if you thought it was dumb you just didnt get it Give it a chance,Notr
I dont agree with people who nitpick The movie delivered everything you want in a movie Its entertaining exciting and contrary to many movies today actually has an ending We left the theater happy to have spent the time watching this Highly recommend and I dont say that lightly,Notr
Help i think i have a ptsd but i gotta say its the best advertisement for cat adoption,Negative
Honestly disappointed I went in with low expectations but this movie didnt even meet them Yes the dinosaurs were pretty cool and had great animation It is not good enough to save the atrocious plot of this movie I was ready for the movie to be over an hour in and felt bored most of the movie All of the tension was forced and it was so predictable To the point where I could count down from three to my wife to predict a larger dinosaur would pop out Im thankful that this movie brought my wife and I closer over our shared laughter at the ridiculous plot I wont see these movies in theater any longer Im so glad it was free,Notr
"Actually the movie overall tells a nothing teaching story It is basically about an emoji running away from other emojis It doesnt really have a plot twist moral or either characters that I could identify to 
 But if you want a movie to just watch on wait to work I think that this movie is good for this Thats because even if you dont focus on it for a few seconds or even minutes you wont miss many things",Negative
Wow just from seeing the trailers of this thing I instantly want to vomit IMDb should really allow  star and negative star ratings so I can go lower than a  Honestly Sony what were you thinking when choosing this over the Popeye movie We all knew this film would be a failure if you look on Rotten Tomatoes you see it has FREAKING  And I also think this is the reason why North Korea wants to nuke all of America and I dont blame them This movie made me lose all my faith in humanity Whatever you do DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP You could be doing much better things with your life than paying to go see this pile of crap And not to mention this is a rip off of Inside Out,Negative
This is by far one of the best movies Ive ever seen,Positive
This movie is not trying to be what its not Its a fun comic book flick about an ambiguous hero and it knows itThe visuals are great the story is not perfect but engaging enough I loved the costume choices for the characters the overall mood  eerie at times thrilling curious Great showcase of Morbiuss powers Remarkable acting from Matt Smith as well as from other actors The touch of horror was just perfect  it wasnt too scary but it was enough to make you twitchI loved it It was fun,Notr
I know this is probably heresy to some of you who have seen this movie and were hoping for the ultimate Dragonball epic and were hacked off when you didnt get it but I recommend it highly to anyone who has young boys I took two nine year old boys a  year old boy and a  year old boy and they had a great time They talked about it nonstop for hours that evening I went to see the movie because of the great Chow YunFat and I was able to somewhat enjoy the movie on its own terms I wouldnt recommend thinking about it too much on the way home I do admit that its probably best that I didnt know much about Dragonball heading into the theater and thus I didnt have very high expectations going in Therefore in summary I would personally give the movie about a  or  out of  but as entertainment for my boy and his friends I give it an enthusiastic  out of ,Negative
Sorry this is just awful The story line and plot are just bad It is unfortunate because it had a really great cast and a lot of potential It honestly didnt even feel like it was a film about dinosaurs Too many subplots and pedestrian narratives at play,Notr
It was advertised as some kind of thriller but it rarely tried and even when it did it was rather patheticMany scenes that wanted to be serioussadepic Were kind of funnycringe The motions of the movie were all over the placeAction was terrible in the beginning they tried to be a bit spooky with it but then just went full on Taken and cut every  secondsIt makes no sense the whole thing of Morbius is that hes fast and has boosted awareness Why would they get close to him in action and not show anythingInstead we get to see him fly around the cityThe antagonist was a mess he had no motivation no background of being this evil guy he was portrayed asHe just woke up one day and chose violenceThere were many insignificant side characters that added nothing to the story,Notr
This movie was a little disappointing on that the plot was really bad The visual effects sound and score are great but they barely compensate for the dumb story The previous one was better imo,Notr
Its better than most of the stuff Ive seen I mean the animation is good but it really just ripped off WreckIt Ralph and The Lego Movie,Negative
"Its a shame to see all these extremely negative reviews that are presenting this film as if it is the bloody emoji movie Theyve clearly not seen the original which is just as bizarre and slightly confusing in a good way It is not striving for a crystal intricate plot it is artistic in choreography music set the use of CGI  not straying too far from the original but has added in a clearer way of seeing the story and wonderful casting and a beautiful new song Jennifer Hudsons performance of Memory was extremely emotional just as the original
Not only was it beautiful it was entertaining generating frequent laughs and a constant interest
People should see appreciate and praise this film",Negative
This movie is the one with the most original screenplays Ive watched it two times and one of which was in a cinema theater and I can say that this was one of the best movie expierences ive had ever,Positive
Everything about this movie is simply outstanding The dedication to certain jokes their extreme notatall drawn out choice of humor and especially the story and characters I honestly cannot recommend you and your friends family pets or conjoined twins to see this masterpiece enough,Negative
The storyline is very lazy I dont know who ever okayed this trash,Negative
"A very good description about a realistic film
Long will be in the first place",Positive
Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movieIts one of my favorites of all time I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice But everything else is top notch The actingstoryatmosphereand actions scenes are all amazing If you havent seen this movie see it right now I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away I cant imagine any movie being much better Ill just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better Until then this stands as the best movie Ive ever seen,Positive
Family  people  Ladies were somehow satisfied Final scene cats in Trafalgar Square were lake Brexiters around old cat Better dont waste a money and time,Negative
 of the way into this movie it becomes obvious that TJ Miller and Tony Leonids have started spending way too much time in TJs trailer with what must have been a special hybrid created by Willie and Snoop called On The Ho Again I have never seen a movie go so far off the rails and never find its way back to the train yard much less the tracks It was just one long commercial and the Dance Dance Revolution section was so long they were obviously trying to justify how much they overpaid you know who to be in it Chris Pratt I swear Anna if you say one more thing trying to defend that piece of crap Anna But it had Patrick Stewart in it Front door Slam,Negative
Nothing much too say Its just that dumb and stupid,Negative
I almost didnt see this after hearing so many negative reviews Im glad I did It was as actually pretty good I left the movie theater feeling entertained and thats what I go to the movies for Leto did a fantastic job as Morbius Im looking forward to the addition of the unique character to the Marvel universe and how he will tie in with everyone else Will the movie blow you away No Will it entertain you for a couple of hours Yes,Notr
Storywise the movie could be satisfactory I appreciate the idea how to return the original characters to the matrix But the sheer amount of the scenes from the original trilogy is quite annoying and unnecessarySecond the action scenes are poorly made In some cases its due to a frequent camera changes making it difficult to track the action in other  simply not enough action itselfThird the development inside the matrix from some point became too rushed and quickly unbelievable It lasts until the end of the movie leaving plot holes that shouldnt have been there in the first placeI cannot blame actors albeit Ive expected more action from Keanu but I guess age puts its limits New actors including Morpheus are good enoughOverall it all boils down to a story A story what has happened to humans after Matrix  Unfortunately while this story has some good parts overall feels unbelievable for the fansId say its worth watching just to see the vision of the authors but it falls short of even moderate expectations,Notr
I dont know anyone who ever expressed to me that they needed this movie to exist But it remains a great hour and a half cartoon It has a nice message sweet ending and lotsa loads of laughs Kudos to the CGI ,Negative
It was a cute quirky movie Most definitely not the worst movie out there but definitely a kids movie My daughter and I watched it and she laughed the whole time,Negative
I would rather break all my Jones in my boy than watch this horror movie i hate it,Negative
As its one of the worst animated movies ever made The Emoji Movie is also possibly the worst animated movie to be produced by a mainstream animation studio This is an example of how Hollywood can sometimes be lazy and pile all these issues into one horrible film The writing is at its worst the story has no originality whatsoever the animation is terribly executed the jokes are an embarrassment the message coming from this movie feels outdated the characters are all a bunch of jerks the voice actors didnt even try and the entire world building is the high definition of cringe Everybody do me one favor If you want to keep your sanity dont watch this movie at all Dont even show this to kids in general Very justifiable to win a razzie but I also believing in deleting this movie permanently,Negative
Star studded casts do not equate to be a great movie Especially the Broadway musical play turned to be movie can be disappointing to someone Back in s Betty Buckley perfected Grizabella in Broadway Tough act to follow once someone perfected and branded the role Her version of memory still gives me a chill and makes me cry Also Broadway casts of Cats were in shape back in s I have that version embedded in my mind and Im sure many people shares same sentiment,Negative
"This movie is great probably the best movie Ive ever seen
It has amazing characters
The story is being any other movie and its completely accurate to the original series
It has amazing action and the way the make the characters look is wow
This is the best movie ever
Is what you thought I wouldnt say so oof go oof yourselves",Negative
So worth seeing in the theater thanks to fathom events and th anniversary plus Stephen King turned  recently I admit Ive been on the fence about enjoying Shawshank Redemption for a while but seeing it in the theater and re watching after not seeing it for a long time I cried I laughed felt sympathy and was very immersedTruly remarkable and well deserving of every good opinion even after I was on the fence about it I love the movie a lot now Tim Robbins embodied such a glorious character Frank Darabont made such a crafty dark and heart wrenching experience Fathom events is excellent I am glad I paid over  dollars to see such drama perfected film,Positive
I am not sure at all what the crew were doing or thinking when they were creating this animation film This is such a bad animation film Everything about it was bad and did not make any sense at all The storyline of this animation film was really weak and had no direction at all The cast selection was weak and out if place They did not at all commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters There was not any sign of chemistry between the cast members This animation film was that bad that the crew should not have created this animation film at all It would have been better if it was that way,Negative
Abomination thats the first word that comes to mindLets put it plain if me and my crackhead neighbor got really drunk and decided to make a Matrix parody it wouldve been betterNever thought I wont be able to watch a matrix movie to the end but here we are,Notr
If it wasnt for this movie i would be homeless i dont get why this movie is so underrated and hatted thanks Sony Pictures for this masterpiece truly a match made in heaven I would give it a  but they did not have the dab emoji and fidget spinners thats the only bad thing id say about the movie otherwise its so far the best movie in oh and id wish it had Jake Paul LOL,Negative
This movie relies on fan service by bringing back the old characters from Jurassic park but they forget to write a story They should of killed off some of the characters in this movie cause any one who is about to die get eaten by a dinosaur another character will arrive just in time to save them I mean come on this is final movie why didnt they kill off anyone the only characters that die is the villain and random background characters Owens daughter  I dont remember her name nor do I care just says something sassy and has zero character even though she is the plot of this movie The actress also does a bad accent through out the film and its just so annoying,Notr
When I walked out of the movie I was asked what I liked about it Everything I answered Everything was nearly perfect about this movie the action scenes were intense the plot was easy to follow to enjoy the movie but deep enough that it merits a small discussion with a group or multiple viewings and the acting my god the acting was incredible I found myself laughing out loud not because the movie was particularly funny but because Heath Ledger NAILED his performance in every sceneThe Jokers character nuances were hard to miss and easy to love After his first and second appearances in the movie I found myself just waiting for the next scene with The Joker Ive seen the movie twice now and cant wait to see it again just to see Ledgers actingIts not that the other characters didnt do their part because they did As always Christian Bale delivered a performance that is hard to rival Aaron Eckhart I feel has thrown himself into a realm where those who see this movie will be hardpressed to forget him Ive always liked Eckhart and now when I talk about him others will know who Im talking aboutThe only complaint I had is that the movie felt compact Yes it was long no it wasnt rushed I just felt like there was so much more story to be had Its like when youre reading a really good book and you see the number of pages narrowing and you just dont want it to endMy thanks and congratulations to everyone who made this movie TDK deserves its spot near the top of the greatest movies ever made,Positive
This franchise has so much potential in the liveaction scene In Dragonball Evolution Goku is  and a high schoolcollege student This movie is mostly the Roshi trainingKing Piccolo arcs mashed together which is fine the whole of Dragonball condensed into one movie The pacing through the series was great and really the only thing good about this movie Seeing as they had these two arcs and Goku was  when he fought Piccolo why didnt they just set Goku at  It would be an acceptable change would it not And why did they put him in school To make him seem normal Theres the thing Goku is anything BUT normal and never had a day of formal education in his life THAT was some bullshit Also where was Krillin Krillin was a major character in the seriesHad it not been based on Dragonball it would be a mediocre movie But it ruined one of the most wellloved franchises in history and that makes it one of the worst movies of all time,Negative
This is my least favorite of all the Jurassic park movies There are some scenes i could say are great but thats all only some scenes I thought because it was last one they could it did something amazing like other franchises but I was so wrong,Notr
I thought Sony outdid themselves with how bad Venom was Then they released Let There Be Carnage and I thought nothing could be worse than that Enter Morbius Absolutely awful The action scenes will put you to sleep I strongly recommend NOT wasting your time on this,Notr
It was Christmas hanging out with the family all of a sudden the trailer for the Cats movie came on and everyone stops talking and watched the trailer which was actually pretty epic and then at the end of the preview my Grandma said that looks terrible and I just burst out laughing,Negative
II dont even know where to begin Its been  days since I watched the Emoji movie and I still cant get it out of my head Never in my life would I have thought that a movie of such exquisite beauty could EVER exist But here it is and it has exceeded all expectations Tony Leondis has hereby proved to be the first homo universalis of the st century and should in my humble opinion be honored with the Nobel Peace Prize of  for bringing people together and almost creating world peace Of course there will always be people that envy successful people like Tony Leondis but we should all just dab on the haters to let them know we do not fck around Im heavily looking forward to Mr Leondis upcoming project which is supposedly going to be featuring fidget spinners This man definitely knows how to save humanity,Negative
Everything in this movie DOES NOT resemble the real Dragon Ball anime series Dragon Ball is one of the greatest stories ever made yet this movie is not even close to a single episode from the originalThis movie remains me of two other Hollywood made movies based on two beloved video games seriesDouble Dragon and Super Mario BrosThose games are fun they have an interesting story the cartoon series are fun to watch yet the movies suck they are lameIts almost as if Hollywood were intentionally trying to remake awesome series from Asia with the lowest crappiest quality as possible to make them look bad The only thing not added this time was musical intervals with the typical dancing and the singing to add their typical touch of junkAvoid this movie like the plague,Negative
Two imprisoned men Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman bond over a number of years finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decencyIs this the greatest film of all time IMDb would have you believe so Despite being a box office flop that barely recouped its budget the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting story and realism It has since been successful on cable television VHS DVD and BlurayAnd it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year Now twenty years old the film has not aged a day and instead seems to be getting better This is Tim Robbins best role and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman,Positive
This is an excellent film The CGI is great The characters are great But I have one problem which is the character development It didnt have much of it but that is the only problem The movie did start of really confusing but in the  minute part I got used to the story In conclusion this is a great film and I would highly recommend it,Positive
This movie is an alltime disappointment We have been waiting for years for the movie to happen When the announcement was made to produce the movie at last we the avid Dragon Ball fans were all tearing in excitementLittle did we know we came out of the theatre after the movie preview full of resentment and grievance To the true Dragon Ball comic fans out there do not expect the story or characters to have major colleration to the original Not only the story line twisted but characterplay was utterly out of the way Shenren the dragon was really crappy One glance at Master Roshis flowery shirt put me off the dinner table for days Give us back the perverted Roshi This movie needs a serious remake to stay truthful to its origins and be answerable to the disappointed comic fans worldwide,Negative
So I watched this movie a couple times and I heard before watching it Its Bad Or Its Horrible So anyways I watch it and the whole thing was okayBut I really dont understand why its rated  stars I mean Its not that bad but I would recommend And it was just Stupid a little bit but funny at the same time,Negative
An entire masterpiece of Christopher Nolan Very mind blowing movie but with an excellent story Ten out of ten,Positive
I was recently diagnosed with cancer and watching this movie made it worse I went from stage  all the way to stage  They brought me out of the theater on a gurney along with six orphaned children who tried killing themselves after realizing theyd rather watch their parents die again then watch this filmed abortion My doctor says I dont have long to live Im currently awaiting results,Negative
"We live in a society 
Also the main character Gene is hot",Negative
I really wanted to like this and I admit it has its moments but even considering the hate of the second and third installment this is the worst matrix movie of them allThe dialogue seems superficial uninviting and even comic at some points The pace of the movie is too consistant and gives no room to breathe and enjoy the depth and thoughts of any of the charactersThe matrix is a game theme could have worked but ended up as an unfunny parodyEven the song in the ending I would guess should be a nod to the rage against the machine track used in the original but using Brass against is another cringe worthy parodySave your theatre money and watch it on your couch a sunday afternoon when you have nothing else to do,Notr
Tye movie is just perfect The acting the story the characters are just so good that they will even make you cry,Positive
This is certainly not a bad film but it is Also completely overated in my opinion This story has been done a million times and How the wardens didnt notice he was chipping through the wall everyday to escape is beyond me The acting throughout is very good but i am shocked to see this number  on the chart,Positive
Disney shills and unprofessional shill reviewers have bombed this almost average movie Visual effects and visuals were great sound was great much better than Wonder Woman  Eternals VenomCarnage Black Widow or ShangChai Dont believe the hate VERY cool entertaining and atmospheric The leads were all very strong probably my fave Jarad Leto performance and Adria Arjona was fantastic I just wish Hollywood would stop trying to make Matt Smith work bit cringe though he was great on the Crown Over all it could have used a bit better story with villains but I will happily pay to see another  Morbius and Nightstalkers movies,Notr
I expected Howard the duck such was the hate for this movie Instead I got a short dark sometimes quite violent slice of entertainment Not the usual overcomplicated Overlong marvel stuff that all end up being the same Matt Smith and Jared Leno gave excellent performances and the special effects for a medium budget movie were very different but still very good Its a simple origins story and to me I think Jared Leno may be the cause of bad reviewsmaybe because he wasnt the Joker of choice and thats a problem for some people But reviews suggesting this is some kind of disaster turkey are absolutely wrong,Notr
This is the greatest movie i have ever seen People hate on it because it is emojis but this movie is so much more than that It has a lot of social commentary it has a deep meaning it has meaningful subplots an engaging story lovable characters it has it ALL If you havent seen this movie do yourself a favor and watch it It will change your life,Negative
I feel sorry for the people who actually went to the cinemas and watched this movie I feel even sadder for the voice actors This movie was just a big step back in their career Who even thinks of this hecking storyline you seriously have to hate the world and all of its beauties to create such an abomination of a movie Ive seen the movie ATM which was a movie about a friggin ATM bullcrappery that made me search for the Director and find him and ask him how can someone make such a shitty movie and it was a better movie than this,Negative
Tbh i would rather burn my money than watch this movie I never expected to see anything worse than the live action aladdin or worse than the old live action sonic film but here it is nightmare fuel,Negative
I wish i hadnt seen it and The Matrix had for me remained a trilogyThats really all one needs to say about itIf pushed i would say most of the film is spent flailing around trying to explain its reason for beingthe movie itself seems to wonder why it even exists and i certainly cant explain itLove Keanu But he should have left this alone star because Keanu is a top bloke,Notr
I have long viewed the Shawshank Redemption as the most underrated film of all time  That isnt to say that it wasnt universally acknowledged by the moviegoing public as a great movie but in terms of awards critical acclaim and best ever lists this has somehow kept on losing out  Now that I see it has the number two position as voted by the moviegoing public on probably the most accurate best ever list in the world AFI be damned I am eminently pleased  There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best picture over Shawshank  Certainly Forrest Gump is a charming wellacted film but it is nothing compared to this  Morgan Freeman excels and Tim Robbins turns in his best performance  If you havent seen this masterpiece get up and rent it immediately,Positive
"Love it Every bit of itA top notch superhero movie genuinely lost words
so I had this in my thoughts for hourThis movie wasnt supposed to be like this
far enough to deserves the good ratings
because the intentions of this movie its simply to fight Joker the main villainBut this one hits different with Nolans vision that wanted to show us the real persona of whom the Dark Knight really isThe messages that this movie have really determine the true words that never told before that makes you truly appreciate Bruce Wayne as a person and Batman as a Dark Knight that Gotham needsWatched every DCs movies this week this one is trully the greatest ever made",Positive
This movie attempts to exploit the nostalgia of the original characters and it fails miserably at every level The action the editing the direction its all terrible The movie has no focus too many characters that have nothing to do and nothing to do with each other The only positive thing I can say about this movie is they did use plenty of real props for some of the dinosaurs so its not like the actors are always looking at a green screen However everyone just feels kind of disconnected from the movie Like everyone involved knew the script was trash and the movie would just be a cash grab because they knew idiots like myself would go and see it Oh well Just Hollywood doing what they do best,Notr
Jurassic World Dominion is a film with ugly dialogue and a really bad montage of the film I didnt like the story neither is the management of the characters Disappointing,Notr
Good acting from all concerned carries the rather simplistic and obvious storyline beyond the saccharine but the villains are really predictable in their villany and the storyline while initially moving and affecting seems forced and unreal once you step back from Robbins and Freemans performancesIn other words a high impact movie that rapidly loses credibility with considered thought after viewing Far more worthwhile though than many other similarly stretched dramas and by no means a failure But by no means in the top rank of movie making,Positive
I too was once innocent I lived in a pure bright world full of hope In my navety I said surely it isnt as bad as they say Never have I been more wrong in my now Godforsaken lifeI can only hope that whoever created this atrocious disease of a film enjoyed the copious amount of drugs they must have taken to decide this should have been made I would need even more than they were on to make it through the movie again without ending it all in the movie theatre with a plastic strawAlso we need to save Judi Dench from whoever has forced her to be in this cinematic representationr,Negative
We have seen a lot of Super Hero movies but The Dark Knight is different from all other super hero movies that is Christopher Nolan I Wonder why they dont give an Oscar for Best Screenplay writing,Positive

In the first thirty minutes of watching this show on a slow Saturday afternoon I knew it was my favorite  I was captured instantly by how the story unfolded  You cant help but deeply respect Andy Dufrain I dont know if thats spelled correctly  The way he speaks with thought and hope the way he walks about the jail collecting rocks  Seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is imprisoned in a jail  They couldnt have found a person that suited the roll of Red better than Morgan Freeman  His voice is perfect for the narration of the film  Every card played by this movie was an ace  From the way they filmed the tall barren walls of the prison to the brilliant story thanks to Stephen King for that and lets not forget the music  I am pleased to see that its in the top spot of this site I think it deserves it,Positive
This is a normal average movie  People are just hyped because it is in   And I dont think those people have seen a lot of movies  Its way too much overrated in my opinion  My honest rating would be ,Positive
Well I understand it doesnt have amazing graphic and etc but contentyes Ive watched original dragonball series and loved them was kind of interesting Im not sure why it has such low rating on imdb its not a masterpiece but it really deserves more,Negative
If I were the guy being paid  figures to watch a movie and determine if it was ready for theaters or not Id have quit just to avoid finishing this train wreckNo fluid plot horrible consistency my girl outran a velociraptor that then outran a speeding vehicle everything about this was just aweful The silliest FastFurious mockup doesnt compete with how absolutely attrocious this movie was Even the dinosaurs special effects seemed to have taken a dive in quality This is the movie version of taping a banana on a wall and calling it abstract art and literally paying millions for it,Notr
"But thats what this movie makes them to be I know they got the same director but please they are all miserable and make us feel that rats and racoons are way more fortunate and frivolous
If you think the most anticipated song of the whole show Memory  could do no wrong after a long torturing waitingtime It went terribly wrong and disappointing but I only expected this  minutes to be ok I expected nothing more This song sung by Jennifer Hudson had got to be good Wrong its the worst moment of the entire movie it was way over done its NOT a stage show its a movie but the director thought he did the sad sappy thing in Les Miserables and  lets repeat history again and no need to build up her character 
And then the makeup costumes choreography   way way way TOO SAFE
Especially the choreography I would pay double of what I paid for this movie just to watch a dancescene of a Bollywood movie
I should have just stayed home and listened to Barbra Streisand and Barry Manilow singing Memory  over and over again",Negative
I really did like the film but there were times where it was a bit elongated Some people might not be able to relate but when your job revolves around social media you kinda get a better connection with the characters,Negative
Ive watch this movie about  times and still you see details you didnt see beforeI was young when this movie came out  years old and watched It when I was  It is just a masterpieceThe writting is perfect the acting is perfect the screenplay is perfect the set is perfect one of the best cast there is Leonardo Dicaprio never disappoints The sensation of the film is there you feel like youre also in a dream Lets not forget Hans Zimmer who is in my opinion the best film composer there is the music is epic and works perfectly with the movie Absolutely incredible It is now  and a week ago Ive watched Oppenheimer and Lets just say that Christopher Nolan is in my opinion the best if the best you dont have to agreeBest film Ive ever saw Everything is just perfect,Positive
This movie is an hour and a half long advertisement There was no reason or idea behind this movie but rather they needed an excuse to just shamelessly plug things,Negative
Great presentation but in the end nothing comes out Tom Hardy and Leonardi DiCabrio as always good But all in all its one of the worse Nolan movies The end of the movie however is good the spin that maybe turns or not is a very nice idea The film is confused bichts is explained to one I like Christopher Nolen Especially The Dark Knight but this film is mercilessly against him,Positive
"It needs a special kind of stupid incompetence to have so much budget and so many stars and still produce total crapWhat did they try to achieve A mission impossible clon with spontanous dinosaur appearances A James Bond cover with some snakeskin A fast and furious remake on the lizard side No one will ever knowOnly thing that remains sure is

I really dont see the movie deserving even the  star out of It has molested the image of Dragonball ZGT  which has been the hard work of animemakers in Japan over so many yearsThey just destroyed the epic The filmmakers should go to jail for this If there is a petition for blacklisting the filmmakers from doing any more irreparable damage  i will be more than happy to sign itThe image i had in mind for Goku was destroyed and things keep happening on their own Crappy directingproduction Its the perfect example of how you can destroy an empire by just shunning its king with some sort of rape chargesWatching the whole movie was too big a deal for me  but i endured yes  endured the whole movie just to see how bad it could get And believe me it was much worse than i had anticipated If you consider yourself a DragonBall fan  DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE I absolutely Taboo anyone from watching it,Negative
A new force threatens Gotham City and The Face of The Joker is always smilingIt is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog I include the previous movie The Burton years Adam West era etc and forged together something quite incredible making not just The best Batman movie of all time but arguably one of the greatest movies of all timeTwo and a half magical hours this film excels in every conceivable field it is wonderfully dark atmospheric and moody but in equal measures it is exciting action packed and dynamicThe story couldnt be better its so good itll appeal to those that dont even enjoy superhero movies it really is that good Packed with incredible action scenes its visually awesomeChristian Bale is once again fabulous this Batman is a little petulant a little impatient but wonderfully intense What every hero needs though is a villain and what takes this film up another level is Heath Ledger whos remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishingAn incredible supporting cast once again Caine and Freeman once again show why theyre Hollywood royaltySuperior to pretty much everything else,Positive
When I watched Shawshank Redemption at firstI had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me I say that I learned how to follow your passions and hopes how to struggle to be free And  dont never forgethope is good something and good somethings never die  this sentence which passes in the film I always believe it every part of mine Because A person lives with his or her hopes and passions so If it is seized from peoplethat people lose their aims in the life And what the best properties of this film It shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for peopleIn addition to my review about Shawshank Redemption Whenever I watch this film I learn that it puts in new things my life It is so important for every watcher Shawshank Redemption should be watched and I advise it to you ,Positive
This movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life It is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap even when all your life has crumbled over your face hope is still your last hopeOne night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped What would you have done had you been in his shoes keep on hoping Well Andy not only had hope he gave hope to his fellow prisoners The brilliant Morgan Freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and if he werent in this movie the movie would have lacked something for sureThere are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and I have commented on hundreds of movies but very few I gave the full  out of  and this movie is one of those few,Positive
This one is a masterpiece and could easily be considered the best superhero movie of all time Its predecessor set the stage wonderfully for this one to shine It felt like Nolan was just working out the kinks in his vision for the trilogy before blowing away audiences with The Dark Knight Heath Ledger RIP was outstanding I remember being upset he was cast in that role before ever seeing his incredible range to nail the Joker As always the score the settings and the story were so well done and up to the Nolan standard but this time he pretty much exceeded it I will always cherish how great TDK made me feel after walking out of the theater for the first time  stars,Positive
Good news is I got to see it for free on an HBO free weekend and did not have to pay to see itBad news I got to see the movieI was really looking forward to this movie The trailers were great and the concept was intriguing The problem was the execution Once again chase scenes fights explosions special effects etc took the place of good writing What could have been a cerebral movie just turned out to be another action movie I do not want to take anything away from the special effects they were very good and some were outstanding My problem was that maybe there was only  minutes of actual plot and dialog in the entire movie After a while you quit wondering if it is real or a dream and just start dreaming that the movie will end soon There are really no good twists and turns in the movie and little that is so thought provoking that you want to talk about the movie afterwordsMy advice would be to take the special effects budget and spend it on some great writersAs the old commercial asked Is it real or is it Memorex Who cares,Positive
When i was  i saw the Chinese live action version of dragon ball it was an awful movie it looked like if it had a budget of two thousand dollars or less The acting was horrible and the special effects were pretty bad It seemed like something that some fans would upload in youtubeThe matter is that this movie had a budget of millions of dollars and i still prefer the Chinese versionThe problem with this movie is not the history the problem is that it lacks of the essence of DB I wouldnt be upset if just goku were more like a little innocent brave boy instead of a classic horny American teenager,Negative

Absolutely nothing made sense in this movie Every visual aspect was nauseating and an absolute waste of great talent Jellicle zero out of jellicle ten,Negative
I thought the movie was absolutely horrible It was truly a waste of money I tried to get my money back but didnt leave within  minutes of the movie so I had to sit through the retarded bizarre movie Who ever gave this four stars should be shot If Leonardo couldve read my dreams while I fell asleep during the movie he would not have been flattered Maybe I didnt get the concept of the movie but it was annoying how they kept going from one dream to another dream to skiing and snow mobiles then a van driving off a bridge then to a guy floating down a hallway then to his wife and kids All for corporate espionage Who cares about the company I wish there was something redeeming about the movie but I couldnt think of anything We did have a good laugh about how bad it was so that should account for something If anyone reading this wants to pay me back the money I wasted on the movie I will gladly accept it After the movie we went to see Salt which I thought was excellent and very entertaining,Positive
I dont know why ms Vachovski want to make the fourth part of Matrix As for me the story was finished in Revolution Unfortunately the Resurrections is reboot that nobody neededFirstly the scenario is a little bit strange it has a lot of gaps and questions without answers It shows old characters in new world But their decisions are very strange sometimesSecondly the cast good Of course Keanu Reeves and AnnMoss are amazing but others is just doing their jobThirdly the action itself is good but its not awesome how it was in trilogySo its reboot making without any purpose,Notr
Honestly I wish I was joking Just everything was completely terrible James Corden was cripplingly awful but thats nothing particularly surprising Leaving the cinema Id felt as if my soul had been sucked dry Avoid at all cost,Negative

There is nothing outright bad about the film but besides from some ok action that can be hard to follow there is nothing good ether Its just going through the motions and it has nothing interesting or memorable about it It feels like a film made by  people in a factory nothing is done very bad but it lacks heart and vision It doesnt have a style a world worth staying in or characters worth caring for Its not so bad its good its just bland and dull,Notr
I dont know why this movie was ever made and I dont know who the movie was made for Because the jokes are so stupid I dont think kids would laugh at it Just dont bother,Negative
This movie was a mistake in all senses of the word The animation was pretty good Ill give it that but the writing and quality control of the voice acting and screenplay was abysmal The only benefit to this movie was the reaction of the internetSony Pictures Animation has fallen so very far,Negative
This was the worst movie Ive seen in my whole pathetic life Me and my good friend went to see it with high expectations We were disappointed The whole movie was filled with Jailbreak telling how girls are always put behind men DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS Hopefully this movie gets taken down It was a huge waste of my time,Negative
Truly a movie that must be seen by allI am a Batman fanmy favorite superheroand Cristian Bale has made me proud once again with his performance in The Dark Knighthe did well from Batman Begins and in The Dark Knighthe confirmed itBut to mei really did enjoy and was blown away by Ledgers breathtaking performance herei mean how can you not be blown awayIm sorry to Jack Nicholsonhe was still incredible in the original but LedgerWOWI have always been a fan of Ledgerseen pretty much all of his moviesand with this performance as The Jokerhe needs to receive some kind of awardbecause RIP had he been alivei can guaranteehe will be wanted by all movie directorsstudios to be a star of their moviesSoI bow down to The Legendary Heath Ledger The Joker,Positive
Adapting a beloved franchise like Dragon Ball comes with high expectations and Dragonball Evolution fails spectacularly on every level Instead of honoring the source material the film delivers a soulless uninspired and utterly misguided take on the legendary anime and mangaThe story is generic the characters bear little resemblance to their original counterparts and the action sequences lack the energy and excitement that made Dragon Ball iconic The dialogue is laughably bad and the CGI feels outdated even for its timeEven as a standalone film its a messpoorly written poorly directed and completely missing the essence of what made Dragon Ball special Fans deserved better This is one of the worst liveaction anime adaptations ever made,Negative
"You can tell the true stage performers in this There is great singing dancing and acting by them There are  or  of the tvfilm actors that let it down a bit

I believe this is one of of the greatest films of all time I know that people wont have the same opinion or view as me but I fail to find anything wrong with the film other than I wish it was longer and it just didnt have to end,Positive
Absolutely one of the best films I have ever seen The Joker and Batman fantastically portrayed by Heath and Christian with phenomenal chemistry between the characters Over a decade on since it was released and countless superhero watched by myself since and this is still definitely the best one out there The depth and rationalities the joker gives leave the viewer wondering whether he is crazy or completely sane in this thought provoking cinematic masterpieceNo spoilers here but when you watch it you will be on the edge of your seat with anticipation you will also feel so connected to both the joker and batman on an emotional level,Positive
Dont think there are any good things to say about this pile of I loved the first Jurassic park even the next two were watchable the World films started quite decent nd OK if daft But this is just an excuse to make money Theres no story its just like some execs have just said Hmmm We could probably quite easily make a few hundred million without any effort just throw some dinosaurs on screen crappy special effects and dont worry about storyThe special effects at times are laughable Theres one in the opening sequence where a dinosaurs is next to a train Seriously looks like a Dr Who effect from  Really really badSo my advise is watch Jurassic Park even the first Jurassic world dont bother with thisIts embarrassing,Notr
There are very few movies which have the power to change a persons life A two and a half hour movie which has the power to turn your long darkest hours into the most delightful moments if you are really willing to feel every bit of the movie This movie gave me a hope and reminded me of a quote that tough times never last but tough people doThere are a lot more things to learn from this movie Dont miss them because you may never come across them in your life so beautifully This movie goes into my favorite movies list which only had  movies so farin  years excluding this one This is my first review which I strongly felt to be postedDONT MISS ITWatched this movie twice yesterday OMG Avoided watching it all these years because I knew there would be a lot of unimaginable brutality Finally gave in yesterday The depth of each character portrayed so fully how their role affected the rest The magnificence of Andys not just surviving  years in that mess knowing his innocence He thrived and did so much good that the corrupt Christian warden was so desperate to keep him there that he committed murder I loved the way that everything was tied together and released by the end,Positive
Sorry Hollywood there must have been some sort of misunderstanding hereYou had the budget you had the return of the legacy cast you had the source material two amazing novels and the original movies to draw inspiration from yet you come up with this Ive played Jurassic Park video games that have a more competent creative and entertaining story Everyone involved with the writing of this story should be embarrassed with themselves Pretty much every scene that occurred I was waiting for Vin Diesel to show up and say something about familyI think I speak for everyone when I say we dont want laser pen controlled Raptors chasing Chris Pratt around Malta on a motorbike If theres anyone out there who disagrees I hope you are happyAt this point I think this franchise needs to call it quits and thats coming from someone who has a special place in their heart for Jurassic Park and dinosaurs in generalSeriously how did the dinosaurs look better in  than they do now hahahaha,Notr
Probably Jared Littles best performance ever I morbed a little when Dr Michael Morbius said his iconic line its morbin time Its no wonder that this film sold three morbillion tickets in the first week,Notr
Its a bad musical So it mosf definitely should not have turned into a movie,Negative
Its very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days I like the story and its conceptA thumping good ode to friendship hope wit wiles and wisdom brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since The Crying Game The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting not to mention Oscarworthy film In  it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire a film magazine The year it came out it was nominated for  academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember Forrest Gump Its the nobull performances that hold back the flood of banalities Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving Some of The Shawshank Redemption comes across as outrageously improbable Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil,Positive
So is Morbius as bad as the critics claim I would like to differ to that opinion Yes you cannot compare it to movies like Black Panther Avengers or even any SpiderMan MCU movie but it is an entertaining movie I would say its better than a lot of those mediocre superhero movies Yeah the postcredits dont make sense but thats not the movie right I like the acting by both Matt Smith and Jared Leto their chemistry is great Jared Leto gave his all The acts are not that well differentiated but the fight sequences are great especially the slowed ones it just feels like an immersive experience I like the way the powers of vampires are portrayed The movie feels like a typical superhero movie with a backstory and a proper conclusion I dont know what the fuss is all about Though yeah if you expect an avengers level movie you will be disappointed a lot but you know not to expect that its a lowbudget superhero movie I hope my opinion makes you alteast try you watch that on an ott and not on the cinema But well lets see what Sony can do,Notr
I didnt intend to see this movie at all I do not like prison movies and I dont normally watch them I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons she said to me Whenever I feel down or depressed I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better At the time I thought that was very strange One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already I remembered what she said so I watched it I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showingNo action no special effects  just men in prison uniforms talking to each otherThe Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen I do not judge it by its technical merits  I dont really care about that I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best The best movies are ones that touch the soul It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul,Positive
Now dont get me wrong I did like this movie but really Why does everyone think this is the most amazing superhero movie of all time the movie dragged on for far too long and really wasnt as entertaining as movies like SpiderMan  Iron Man or even the Tim Burton Batman films In my mind this movie doesnt hold a candle to those movies the general plot was boring and way too serious Bales acting was horrible He was much better in Batman Begins and there was way too much dialogue On the other hand Ledger was amazing as the Joker and the overall acting from the rest of the cast was good With the exception of Bale and Aaron Eckhart they were pretty bad in this one The action was great although at some points in the movie I felt like Ive seen it all before over all the movie was good and I wouldve even considered it a classic at one point but the overall hype of this movie seems to extinguish that notion from my mind as I said before its a good movie but not as amazing as people put it out to be,Positive
Like Moulin Rouge the movie Cats is a weird sort of fantasy movie far far removed from reality Cats is definitely the lesser movie but still the concept is interesting the digital fur fascinating the singing can be terrific and the dance moves ballet hip hop Fosse and tap are great If dancing singing cats isnt your thing and if youre not a cat person best go see some other film This ones definitely for diehard fantasy fans Also if catlike people or peoplelike cats with digitally twitching tails and ears freak you out then stay away,Negative
PLEASE DONT DO WHAT I DID AND BE TEMPTED TO SEE THIS FILM SURELY THE REVIEWERS MUST BE WRONG I THOUGHTNOPE SPOT ON ITS IS AWFUL,Negative

Its not as bad as everyone was saying it was Its not like the kind of movie that you want to see again and again but I would recommend getting it from Redbox There are only a few funny jokes and the story can easily be lost Also some of the characters personalities are pretty bland but still a good film to watch once,Negative
Great movie One of the best movies in the world is great,Positive
Lmao I am not even going to talk about it This movie was so horrible that its giving me nightmares,Negative
Easygoing family fun film People are too quick to make assumptions these days Gave it a chance had a laugh along and enjoyed it Also I thought the storyline was great and the animation was also very good The use of apps in my opinion felt clever rather than a money maker We laughed along throughout enjoyed the puns and found the online rating quite harsh The voice of James corden as highfive and Jennifer Coolidge as Mehs mum really quite entertaining We managed to play a drinking game along to this and it was so funny we drank a few bottles of wine and genuinely had a good time Would recommend if you want an easygoing film to put on,Negative
A return of all the originals What more could you ask for to wrap up the nd trilogy Laura Dern Jeff Goldblum were my highlights Im glad it seemed all  of the main cast got equal screen time and it wasnt overpowered by the Bryce Dallas Howard and Pratt TBH I had completely forgotten the storyline with the girl but overall I thought it was a very fun action Dinosaur movie,Notr

I have always loved movies in which to overcome odds a character must think and not just use muscle The Shawshank Redemption is one of if not the best example of this I LOVE IT,Positive
What if you had someone watch this at gunpoint They would become the creepy dudes from Life of Luxury I kinda felt like one after this wretched movie was over,Negative
Maybe Im easily pleased but I enjoyed Morbius its not the best Marvel film out there but still very watchable and I never got bored at any time Dont go in expecting an Oscar winner film its just a good action film It definitely doesnt warrant some of the terrible reviews everyone thinks they are filmmakers these days,Notr
Thank you for everyone who made this movie i got a good laugh watching the horrible acting stupid plot and teenagerich CG That moment when jared riding the train wind is priceless i choked on my drink,Notr
Again letto provides a poor over the top performance Average scriptonly redeeming quality of the film is Matt smith a quality performance of a poor script An example of what not to do with a marvel film Strange but it feels more like a boring dc movie than a marvel film This film would sit nicely in the dc universe as its dull boring and takes its self to seriously,Notr
Just like my title it is an entertaining movie with just a classic story between friendships woubds good and evil and the struggle to keep sone decency Some nice cgi and decent acting You shouldnt be too demanding though but in my opinion its better than some other Marvel movies like Venom I dont know everything about multiverses but I like superhero movies because of the classic dilemma of how to stay human meanwhile being different and how to keep a stand towards things like temptation Luckely for me the good always wins so that keeps my hope alive about the future of mankind,Notr

I guess I care more about a plot it was all over the place so basically there wasnt one the original Jurassic Park magic zero here just a show and tell of beasts and the exact same escape situations youve seen  times before the acting the little girl was HORRIBLE Chris Pratt was wooden and seemed irritated that the other actors were in the movie Laura Dern thought she was in a fashion show instead of a movie Jeff Goldblum was just plain weird and must have gone off script so the film editor hacked up his dialogue All of those in a movie are distracting and not enjoyableThe only good things were Sam Neill at  looked AMAZING and I loved this black lady who was a pilot yet she only had about minutes of screen timeAlso I absolutely hate it when a movie preaches to me and then ends the movie with what they THINK is an original profound statement that youve seen and heard a  times before which was  we can all get along and live in harmony no matter how different we are Yawn,Notr
Is a timeless masterpiece that captures the essence of human resilience hope and the power of connection Set against the backdrop of a prison the film takes viewers on an emotional journey exploring profound themes that resonate universallyFrank Darabonts direction brings an intimate yet grand vision to life blending a compelling narrative with stunning visuals The performances are extraordinary with the lead actors delivering subtle yet deeply impactful portrayals of their characters The pacing is perfect allowing every moment to breathe and every scene to leave a markThe films ability to inspire and uplift even in the face of despair is what makes it a standout Combined with a beautiful musical score and thoughtful cinematography it is an unforgettable experience that stays with you long after the credits rollIf youre looking for a movie thats both thoughtprovoking and emotionally moving The Shawshank Redemption is a mustwatch Its a story that reminds us of the strength of the human spirit and the enduring power of hope,Positive

This is the second time around that ive seen Inception The first time around was about  years ago and back then it was just for the sake of watching all the best movies on IMDB I did not understand it then and i do not fully understand the end quarter of the film still but what i can say is its for sure a beautiful film throughout I am a big fan of the ending with it being a subtle cliffhanger that is not the usual cliche type and takes the film back to the very beginning and reminds of all again of the purpose of Cobbs misson Its even a bit emotional The only real complaint i have is i would have liked to know how this method of breaking into peoples minds and dreams works All in all a fantastic rewatch and definitley saves itself,Positive

Today its ranking is  out of top  movies of all times That is absurd This movie is great  but by no means best movie ever It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather Pulp fiction Matrix etc I loved the movie  but nothing in the movie was revolutionary The story line was not extraordinary The gadgets were great but we have seen better sweet tires on the bat mobile  bike Acting was great By all means worthwhile of watching  but I am actually very disappointed to see it at  movie of all times,Positive
Not far into this film I thought it wasnt for me but my husband will like it But after enduring more than half of it I realised that was an insult to his intelligenceUtterly boring and confused rather than confusing with pointless violence just for the sake of it Will no doubt make a decent computer gameI am giving this  purely for the special effects which are OKIf I never I see another film like this it will be too soonI have never reviewed a movie on here before but I felt I must as that  rating has to change,Positive
DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE I DID AND I WILL NEVER GET THOSE  MINUTES BACK,Negative
I have been WAITING for this app to let me write a review it FINALLY is allowing me to do it I have always love dragon ball DBZ and GT Super is out and thats great as well Akira Toriyamas mind is amazing for what he has done If anyone thought this movie was his doing they would be naive and havent truly seen the series This is an atrocity to all that is Dragon Ball Acting is mediocre at best the script sounds like it came from a  year olds dream when they try to make it cooler than it actually is No one in this movie even resembled any of the characters from the series Even though they FORCED it with Gokus hair except for Yamcha thats EXTREMELY agruable HOW did James Wong even get the approval for this movie All in all this was a sad excuse for Dragon Ball,Negative
I loved the emoji movie It made me want to dab become a princess and not wash my hands after taking a poo This cinematic art piece will be admired one day instead of hated The future earth ruling aliens will see it and be like We are running out of toilet paper and we have a lot of copies of this laying around That movie is a landmark in cinema The Emoji Movie is undoubtedly better than The Lego Movie and Wreckit Ralph both of which ripped off The Emoji Movie I mean come onthe movie has a talking hand A Twitter Bird It even says hashtag twice I related to the main character because boy It was a great film  dabs out of ,Negative
Dont tire yourself and read negative reviews it all a lies The movie is very good and funny I give it By the way this is my first review I ever made just because I was really angry why this movie get a lot of low rates,Negative
The only thing that could have saved this movie Was for it to have never been created to begin with,Negative
Laura Dern and Sam Neill are terrible Could have done without them in the movie Dern gives the worst performance Ive seen on the big screen in a long long time Her action looked forced and reminds me of a high school freshman in drama class Sam Neil looks lost in all his scenes Could have done without both of them in the movieJeff Goldblum was the opposite and made the best of a badly written movie At least his parts were entertainingThe movie was disappointing for it could have even so much more,Notr
So perfect mental ideas  the timeline is perfect  nolan you are brilliant,Positive
Inception is the first movie nominated for Best Picture that I hated on Its not all thatMy biggest problem was that they couldnt get me to care about the relationship between Leonardo DiCaprio his wife and his child which was suppose to be Dom CobbDiCaprio character biggest motivation I could care less for any of the characters I wasnt emotionally invested at allThis isnt the first time Christopher Nolan tried to take Film Art concepts and commercialize it This is an attempt at making a surrealism commercial The problem with trying to make a surreal movie for the general public is that you have to make it understandable to the masses The dreams in the movie was too orderly Surrealist films like Un Chien Andalou are chaotic like dreamsBig visuals and action sequences arent enough anymore if you cant get me care about what drives the story youre going to lose me,Positive
Just rewatched this masterpiece and its still one of Nolans best and most creative films Like who thinks about stuff like this A dream within a dream within a dream If I could have even a fraction of Nolans imagination Id be thrilledTheres a sense of completion in watching Nolans films youre not left wanting more and you dont think that Nolan shouldnt have added the last  minutes But more importantly theres a sense of completion in the movie itself and its complex characters Nolans strengths are his amazing character arcs and keeping the story together Every time I watch a Nolan film Im in awe and this is no different,Positive
Everything about this is bad I just finished watching it again because I was bored It was so lame I couldnt focus on the movie And as somebody who watched the show on and off for  years I am not basing my views on the movie on how different it is from the showThis movie should have never been made The world would be a better place without it,Negative
No spoilers critical review There are bits of the new matrix that feel a little too light  not dark or gritty enough in places There were a few very corny friendly robots but overall I had fun watching the film despite it not feeling as deep as the first oneVisually it was filmed with excellent CGI that wasnt distracting or overly gimmicky I liked that it kind of broke the fourth wall a bit at the startThe side characters were mostly decent other than just one or maybe two that could have been darker  grittierTheres definitely a LOT of messaging from the sisters around gender identity and transformation which is more on the the nose  accessible than in the first filmsThere was a disappointing cover of a great track from the first film which harshed my vibe a bit it didnt have the same effectThe first half of the film felt a bit deeper than the second halfIt felt in general its probably on par with the second film in a different way It was fun it didnt move me like the first film did but Im glad they made itOverall I think Id call it ,Notr
Acting great story great one of the best jokers that the big screen has ever seen,Positive
I hope the adaptation would be quirky but fabulous and engaging I love musicals The cast was extremely promising The set was the best thing about itThis was nightmare inducing I have never sprinted from a theater before I got a refund Id expected to react to Jumanji The Next Level like this or even Black Christmas if anything Nope,Negative
Well movie start with a good note and it keeps you gripping throughout the time Action sequences are mindblowing specially the vfx are actually very better Jared Leto was so perfect in Morbius role as well as the other cast perfoms well Story was simple not that great but it gives you a different vibe as compare to other scifi films Its a onetime watch if you like scifi superhero filmsYou can definitely enjoy once,Notr
I m waiting for this movie like since an yeari finally watched itI always say this thing Christopher Nolan is a fing geniusnd i m sure gonna keep his portrait in my roomwithin a few daysi loved itthis fin movie is simply fin brilliant nd awesomethis is one of the best films ive ever seenthis movie is a complete mind gamethis movie has a typical screenplayif u miss  secu miss a lotit was like a puzzleall the time i m watchin this moviei m completely immersed into iti m thinking a lot trying to understand it perfectlythis movie gives a lot of work to ur brainby the time the movie finished every thing look different for some timethe screenplay is damn greatand Leonardo DeCaprio did a gr jobhe had his two best movies this yearShutter Island nd now Inceptionnd he really deserves themi loved this moviein fact i liked this movie more than The Dark Knightthis movie is a must must watch,Positive
This movie attempts to be a satire on how modern day generations are constantly using their phones but it fails in every way I gave this a  as apposed to a  or  due to the fact that its a fun movie to rip on with friends But its is still a horrible movie and the worst animated movie of  and arguably the worst movie of that year Its worth your time for  or  viewings but afterwords let your blueray collect dust,Negative
This movie is an abomination and a disgrace to the great anime and manga The acting is crap and the whole thing is really cheesy but the worst thing above all are the creative differences made I am a big fan of the original dragon ball and dragon ball z anime and it is pretty clear what the main flaws are First the completely left out Krillin a central character of the manga and anime Second none of the characters look ANYTHING like the did in the source material They also changed MAJOR parts of the storyline etc Its just BADIm pleased to know that the advertising of the movie is pretty damn bad The less nondragon ball fans who know about it the better I dont want this film to taint dragon balls reputation,Negative
Theres one thing about The Dark Knight that I just dont get why Why do so much people make it out to be something that its not I dont call it a masterpiece for enough reasons I didnt find it gripping and I thought it was schmaltzy as hell just like all the movies I see these days  Sure it was good but its not a masterpiece because I dont call it groundbreaking despite the fact that it made a helluva lot of money and was the biggestgrossing movie of  Honestly even Ive seen better and Im almost  I dont think its the kind of movie that leaves a mark on the worldwide consciousness and it doesnt mean much to me personally It was WAY WAY overanticipatedI honestly dont know if theres any ground left to break but sure we can still show audiences that artistry and business shouldnt be two different things Id really like to see Hollywood do more stuff like that Bottom line what was good back in the Golden Age is still good now I think both the American people and people all over the world can still handle craftsmanship I gave the movie  stars out of  just to be generousId love to see someone pull it off but I dont know if theyd have the gutsTo call The Dark Knight a masterpiece is to say that the viewer clearly has not seen a wide range of filmsYou wanna know what a real masterpiece is Give  A Space Odyssey the first two Star Wars films Casablanca The Wizard of Oz or the first two Indiana Jones films a try and think about it,Positive
Poor in many ways acting effects dialogue fights story and the trashy music I managed to get to the end Nothing like the perfection of the original A mixed up confusing mess that only kids would enjoy,Notr
Its strange how critics attacked this movie No wonder but its far from as horrible as they claimCertain musical numbers extrapolate the effects are silly choreographies mainly of the main actress forcing ballet steps which go against the idea of the filmHowever overall I thought it was an average movie Good funDont believe in such low grades I have certainly seen much worse things that have had more benevolence from critics,Negative
so i just watched Dragonball Evolution Im trying to get the way I felt while watching this movie and I can only describe it as this Imagine youre watching the worst movie youve ever seen eating popcorn Then suddenly you realize that youre not eating popcorn but your firstborn child As horror sears this image onto your soul you hear the faint sound of kamehameha and the complete annihilation of anything that was ever entertaining or held sacred by canon This is a brief glimpse of what it is like to watch this movie Now imagine youre me who paid two dollars to experience this and add the gutwrenching horror that this  hrs of your life couldve been better spent rubbing lye into your eyes At least as your eyesight was burned away you wouldve seen something with a more convincing plot than Dragonball Evolution,Negative
The special effects were great but the science was so flawed in this movie that it was incredible The storyline made absolutely no sense at all It also appears to be a bad ripoff of the Matrix can you say the Architect Even more illogical is the fact that if the Architect can create stairs doors or even an entire dream environment at will why cant they fly destroy anything they want any way they want or make themselves invisible At least in the Matrix Neo could flyThe movie just contradicts all of its own rules People were falling all over the place throughout different dream states but no one woke up even though a sense of falling wakes you up Even worse was the supposed technology used to put everyone in the same dream I dont even want to get started with that one but a pair of earbuds just will not do it I really think we need to stress science a little more in our schoolsIt was pretty cool looking though,Positive
Just a fun fact if you ignore the stupid plot and the scary ps faces and focus your attention on the feets of the characters especially in the background you can see that the cats hover along the surface Im pretty sure me and my friend saw a background character glitch out Anyway a surreal experience,Negative
The exact same anime movie we have seen time and again character shunned for being different from the masses then learns to embrace his uniqueness Dont fool yourself If you think this movie is bad then realize almost ALL animated movies from the past  yrs are equally cliched and bad,Negative
The Emoji Movie is a film that can only be described for me as a kiddieflick meaning it will really entertain the kids and make them love it but for most adults some might find it mediocre enjoyable or just simply annoying In all other words your kids will love it You probably wont,Negative
The film was really a last Goodbye saying thingNice to watch well done digital perfection nice entertainment but easy to forget againBut I do not regret that I watched the last film of this kindBut do not forget  we are the Dinos now,Notr
The movie seemed highly rushed and short we didnt get enough exposition or time to get to know any of the characters and they had too many meta jokes that were cringe and the dialogue was laughable at times This movie was disappointing and couldve been executed better,Notr
This movie is so complete Some say its too long those people are wrong Every scene matters every scene is developing the story and the story it tells is beautiful The filmmakers tell that story in the perfect way It is hard to find something wrong with this film I never got bored from start to finish All the actors were believable and gave great performances Truly one of the best films of all time,Positive
Having never been exposed to the Dragonball franchise this film could not ruin any preconceptions that I may have had were I a fan of the original series Coming into this film with a blank slate I was impressed and entertained throughout The action scenes were good Gokus character progression was well done and I even liked the song at the end during the credits I would recommend this to anyone that wants to see a lighthearted action movie Obviously fans seem to universally hate this film but that must be because it is roughly based in the Dragonball universe not a direct adaptation As a stand alone product there is very little wrong with this movie,Negative
Few things you probably already know about The Shawshank Redemption it was nominated for  Oscars yet failed to win any it failed at the box office and it is one of the best movie ever madeI felt mesmerized watching this movie and I believe everyone who has watched it must have felt the same A perfect adaptation of Stephen Kings novel Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption this movie stays faithful to the plot of the novella with very minor alterations Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have given stellar performances Freemans eloquent narration throughout the film provides the description of the events happening over the prison and his friendship with Andy Dufresne over a number of years from his characters perspective The main themes of the movie hope selfworth integrity and friendship are beautifully interlocked with the prisondrama The climate of Shawshank State Penitentiary is painted gray and dull to amplify the intensity of every event The depiction of institutionalized life and emotions of the prisoners who arent only trapped inside Shawshank physically but psychologically as well are very precise The character of Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins displays extraordinary courage and selfworth in the hopeless walls of Shawshank prison The climax is intricately woven with poetic justice This film is Frank Darabonts Magnum Opus A well deserved  on IMDbs Top ,Positive
I watched this movie cause it got many bad reviews So I thought I should watch it And you know what ITS NOT THAT BADOkay forget about the story look the animation its amazing Btw dont trust critics review too much just watch it on your own And you will know it yourself ,Negative
While the idea for the film is clever it doesnt seem to have been executed very well there were some moments that had me smiling but the film will become outdated quickly with its pop music  use of trends as jokes not a potential classic but enough to keep kids entertained,Negative
Suffers from the same flaws as movies like venom but at least its not super goofy So I appreciated that no stupid jokes every  minutes Villain is weak Fight scenes are weird But its fine,Notr
I rate this movie  because it destroys your brain cells and you will thoroughly enjoy Best movie if you are looking to tarnish your sanity Nobody likes this movie but it is amazing and definitely recommend to you and not kids unless you want them to be stupid for the rest of their live Long story short watch this movie Please,Negative
Im just doing something to help other humans dont watch this movie and just be on your merry way do something more interesting and simply better Hopefully this is not the end of Western culture Its simply terrible that studios are ready to go to such lengths and have such disrespect for their audience that they sht out that kind of garbage If historians ever look back to our times they will probably pin the beginning of our demise to this dreadful movie,Negative
To all current and future high school bandtheater students Enjoy your mandatory viewing of this for years to come,Negative
Like the movies main character the whole story line was meh and left me and my entire family feeling like we wasted our time and money Its hard to imagine a movie this bad coming out at this point of time I can see how this would be OK if a group of college students made it but this is by Sony Pictures I hold those guys to higher standards and they failed us They failed us so bad they should refund me my money,Negative
"Dont even bother with the good reviews they are just jokes that people made but read the good reviews as if it was opposite day because this movie is AWFUL TERRIBLE UPMOST DISGUSTING HORRIBLEEEE i hate this movie so much but i am not angry at the movie rn im craving bleach because this movie is so shit btw if you want a GOOD sound stupid is actually awesome movie go watch the lego movie one of my favorites of the genre
",Negative
This movie is so bad that philosophically it starts to make you question what makes a bad movie and what the different types of bad are This movie is probably bad in the worst way possible  its empty and soulless This isnt art This isnt something that tried and missed its mark Its a manufactured product using a storebought justaddwater story Its the cinematic equivalent of a TV dinner Now TV dinners are edible but are they really nourishing This movie isnt a failure The story is fine and complete But its soulless,Negative
The cast is nice even tho jared leto is to my mind not the best choice for the main actor lot of money and ambitions  worst producers  poor unoriginal special effects and a lot of extremely stupid details in the plot Such a shame Sony,Notr
I really liked this one A nice hommage with its own style Old school summer blockbuster with an interesting story and great dinosaur effects both practical and digital Just sit back and enjoy the ride,Notr
Inception is the smartest science fiction film and overall blockbuster in the last couple of decades that makes you wonder why Hollywood cant find similar genius as ambitious and passionate as Christopher Nolan whose vision is comparable to that of the great Stanley KubrickInception is a new genre of film and can go absolutely anywhere it wants to There are few refreshing experiences at the movies like watching an original screenplay come to life in such a manner as Chris Nolan does He mixes the film noir and science fiction genres seamlessly and the result is absolutely gorgeousInception is a breed of film which deserves every bit of praise earned thus far it knows that its viewers want to see a film that shows unforeseen aspects of the human psyche which Leonardo DiCaprio shows through his character Dom Cobb exceptionally well The film is an experience and so much more than the typical tentpole blockbuster coming out these daysInception is a fine piece of science fiction cinema that feels like a classic yet new film Watch this movie with open eyes and be prepared to witness what many acclaimed a masterpiece and get ready to be surprised,Positive
Its like they tried to make the movie as odd as possible to see how long viewers would last The cats human feet will haunt my dreams until the end of my days,Negative
All of the complaints that I have seen about this movie were ones explaining how viewers did not understand the movie Honestly the movie is really simple to follow if you pay attention Ive only seen it one time and I understood everything Many are saying that they want to see it twice in order to grasp everything but one viewing is enough if comprehension is all you want to get out of the second viewing This being said I would love to see this movie a second time The acting is outstanding and the chemistry between the actors makes the movie so pleasant to watch You instantly forget that these are actors The chemistry between Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt is phenomenal Also Leonardo is unbelievable as always and no one can look better in a suit The topic is so engaging and I would recommend this movie to anyone It has been my favorite movie so far this year and I will definitely be purchasing it as soon as it comes out onto DVD Spend the money see the movie pay attention and everything will be great,Positive
I honestly cant say that Im surprised AT ALL by the reactions of this movie because this was met with almost universal disdain from the pitch alone This is almost like a parody movie that youd find in a Family Guy cutaway or something not an actual product that should exist on this planet Hey have you seen Inside Out andor Wreckit Ralph Good you got yourself a double feature that you can watch instead of paying money to go see  MILLION get set on fire and watch it burn to ashes for  minutes This movie has only one of very very few redeeming traits and it is this ANYONE can get their movie in theaters regardless of talent quality or entertainment value for ages  and under if you throw enough money at it you too can play the same weekend as Atomic Blonde with the smug attitude of Yes people with common sense will see this,Negative
This movie is truly the best film off all time I watched it so much I ended up morbing my pants I remember morbing on other people at the theater where people sat on each others laps so they could fit in the theater to watch the film I cried when it ended but my tears of self completion were unheard behind the thunderous applause of everyone within a  mile radius I had this movie playing at my wedding and I intend to play it at my funeral no wonder this movie won best picture at the academy awards for  consecutive years This is the best film ever if anyone says different they FAKE I envy the people who have never seen it as I wish to watch it for the first time again it felt like losing my virginity in my eyes and ears Enjoy this movie embrace it love it closer than your family and finally feel like you have to do nothing more in life,Notr
I only decided to watch this garbage because of its horrible rating Wanted to see what the fuss was all about Aside from the typical heros adventure that has been played out in films over a thousand times this movie in itself is basically one big commercial to sell apple samsung phones and other products to kids This is the end result when you have a generation of kids addicted to smart phones you get bad movies designed purely to promote products and not focus on actual original plot dialogue characters etc Waste of money shouldve never bought that ticket If youre reading this dont buy their merchandise or the tickets to movies like these It only further promotes the production of garbage movies like this one,Negative
A potato would make a better movie than this A literal vegetable Ive seen potatoes being more entertaining and true to their vegetables roots than this movie The difference between this movie and a potato is that this movie should stay in the ground and never be consumed Its a fact that you can live off potatoes Its also a fact that this movie will devour your will to live Potato good Movie bad,Negative
If I could rank this a zero I absolutely would At least with a movie like Manos The Hands of Fate you KNOW someone tried their hardest and you can somewhat appreciate that There is not one second of consideration put into any frame of this film Every character is bland every design is generic every joke and plot thread is predictableIts a desperate and I do mean desperate attempt to capitalize on a growing and recent trend Its a moneygrabber to say the least You take a subject popular with young kids you get paid by a bunch of different companies to display their terrible apps in the movie etc etc This movie had no passion Movies are made to make money but they are typically a labour of love Most directors put their heart and souls into their films while clearly no one cared about this oneI feel bad for Patrick Stewart Please do not give one cent to the makers of this movie,Negative
The Count of Monte Cristo isnt a very good book and has spawned a few pretty poor films but its the ideas which make it an enduring story Now whether Stephen King was consciously inspired by Dumass Dumasss book when writing the original short story I dont know  what I do know is that Frank Darabont took a dour typically coarselydetailed potboiler and evolved it into something special The big step for me was that having taken an interesting idea and made it good Darabont then found an ensemble cast and a cinematographer who could make it sing I dont think theres a dull line of dialogue in the movie and barely a camera shot either out of place or wasted Why it is that equally talented filmmakers can spend millions and produce the kind of mindless gibberish which actually wins Oscars like Braveheart did in the year Shawshank Redemption was nominated Ill truly never fathom Maybe there should be another way of formally recognising talent wait ten years then take a vote  that way the mindless and the popular will have time to find their level and whats left is worth remembering,Positive
YunFat Chow He must be seriously thinking about sacking his agent An actor of his calibre in a film which barely makes up for the pop corn You would rack your brains trying to find positives for this film But then again I must have known just by looking at the posters Why did I watch it then Well because I have been watching Dragonball anime years and years ago and I was utterly disappointed even beyond the cushion of low expectations I prepared myself with Yes bracing yourself before going to the pictures isnt going to help for that film The special effects were fine  in the early s The plot didnt do remotely justice to the anime The director must have been taking the ps because you cannot seriously try to make a good film and end up with thisAvoid at all cost,Negative
I mean the action is good The story is so all over the place I was left unable to attach myself to any of the characters Its just blah The original is a masterpiece The others wereprogressively worse This could be a nice jumping off point perhaps but the ending made me hope its not Just leave it alone and let it be Maybe come out with some dope Matrix video games with deep story lines I would buy that This left me wishing I went to bed early,Notr
As soon as I saw the title I knew this cant be good Lol of course Keanu being one of my favorite actors I was going to watch this movie no matter how awful and boring it was Yes its not a good movie and yes the story line is pretty much boring and really anything particular to care for The characters are very shallow and you really dont care for any of them But again if they make another one Id probably watch,Notr

You know the type Its so terrible its amazing Yeah this is on my list They have some very talented voice actors so Ill give them that but thats all this project was to them an acting jobBut I dont know what else to put for this review Im just filling the space to make the character mark I originally watched this film because I enjoy Liam Aikens work as well as the other more prominent names and the film about emojiswas as good as could be expected from a movie where emojis have emotionsHave I reached  yetIts not amazing writing or amazing acting but it isan emoji movie,Negative
This film should barely scratch out a spot in the top  let alone be one of the top ranked films of all time It is rather dull extraordinarily predictable and filled with clichs This is not even the best prison film let alone  among all films Cool Hand Luke or Papillon anyone Id give it a  Freeman  Co do not disappoint but someone needs to bring down this bloated rating The film is little more than a rehashing of conventional sentimentalism painted in prison stripes and sold in bulk to a apparently gullible audience Help bring this down to a reasonable position so that more deserving films can attain their proper recognition,Positive
We watched the first  Jurassic films and except of part  we enjoyed all of them thoroughly so we didnt want to miss this one Part  was a bit boringIve read the reviews before we watched this film and think they dont do this movie any justice Neither is the th Jurassic film boring nor is there a dinosaur attack every  minutes People tend to exaggerate Dont take them seriousPart  has Laura Dern Ed Neill Jeff Goldblum and the two major actors from the previous films reunited and we also see Blue the cute raptor She now has a baby and the scenes with Blue and the baby are particularly touchingWhat I also enjoyed about this th part was for one thing the filming locations Malta and lots of new dinosaur types in close up scenesForget about all these lousy reviews simply give it a chance and enjoy this truly entertaining movie,Notr
If they had focused more on how awesome it would of looked day to day for Dinosaurs and animals and humans coexisted after the previous films It could have been jaw droppingSo many characters the dinosaurs were more like extrasThis is the first film I had no jumps or felt zero tensionThank god we finally saw the DimetrodonI just wish after films the plesiosaur got some screen timeSad it was in production this long and we got an action film not a dinosaur film,Notr
"Im currently listening to the original sound track to try and cleanse myself of the film I just saw It was equal parts a bland tedious trudge to get through and a confusing horrifically misjudged spectacle of disaster The tone was all over the place James Corden got some laughs almost purely from the way he seemed to be embarrassed to be in the picture Jennifer Hudsons melodramatic hysterics were more cringe inducing than genuinely emotional Sweeping epic songs are visualised in the most bland and ugly way possible
I spent the whole film feeling frustrated at seeing a bunch of songs I like being butchered Constantly interrupting the flow of a song to simply say a line as opposed to singing it isnt edgy its just worse
The whole thing is so misguided that Im sure even the on set catering was mucked up somehow",Negative
This movies got better characters than Prince of Egypt better jokes than Into The Spiderverse a better concept than Lego Movie a better villain than Hunchback of Notre Dame its emotional moments are stronger than The Incredibles its romance better than Beauty and the Beast its got such a wellfitting theme about feminism and lets not forget the BEST DANCE EVER the emoji pop Truly an unforgettable experience,Negative
The relationship between movies and dreams has always been one of the cinema world key The dream has always been there in different forms and shapes Lots of movies around imagemaking power of the mind since decades before lots of material released to unleash fantasies of millions of people But this one will be a corner stone of this kind of movie and further Im not a Di Caprio fan at all but this time he did amazingly well The idea is not totally original Just to mention a title The Cell is another movie around the using of the mind to discover something But Inception has a different purpose most centered on the use of dreams to obtain the goal The pace of the movie is a continuous innuendo till the last second,Positive
Wow Just wow thanks a lot for this thing that is just SO SHIwhat next the slender man film oh no wait,Negative

Sony has had some bad movies before but Jebus The Emoji movie is the biggest slap in the face to millennials I have ever seen This movie if you could even call it that is the downfall to  and the world as we know it The biggest cinematic flop in history is the Emoji movie It was only created to make money by greedy worthless talent less imbeciles and they succeeded all to well Shameless product placement and trendy voice actors worked And to put the icing on this big stinking pile it was marketed towards kids The Emoji Movie may seem harmless enough but when you take a closer look its just a barbaric marketing scheme that worked out in Sonys favor So whatever you do DONT TAKE YOU KIDS TO THIS GOD FORSAKEN GARBAGE HEAP OF A FILM,Negative
Words cant describe how amazing and entertaining this film is While watching I couldnt take my eyes off it because I had a stroke from excitement Every time I watch this film in the future I will feel that warmth awesomeness excitement and indescribable happiness as if I were a child again and my stepfather again calls me to play in his lustful but no less cozy basement,Notr
The acting was poor and the cgi was even worse It amazes me how a film with budget that big looks like the film has been run through with a snapchat filter Would not reccomend,Negative
I cannot believe that anyone who was involved with this movie has ever even seen the entire Dragonball series First of all why is Goku some white kid with gelled hair They couldnt find anyone that fit that part better really and second I would really like to know why they completely ruined the plot Why did Master Roshi live in the middle of the city why did Bulma not have all blue hair why was Yamcha not afraid of woman why why why did they make this movie there are so many things that they completely ignored that could have been so easily fixed There was no need to change the storyline that much that is why we all loved it in the first place the original effing storyline I am so angry that this movie even exists I think they should release a personal apology to all the fans of the original anime I could have written a better screenplay in my sleep,Negative
What an insult to Michael Crichtons original work Its sad that this is how the franchise is put out to pasture but thankfully its overIt Is Done,Notr
Feel that this movie is simply beautiful I dont mind the fact that it is long about  and a half hours but what if it is the perfect movie from experience I went to see it at the cinema and since then I have seen few Sometimes so as not to get bored with her but I remember her as a damn exam man and as Gordon says at the end hes a hero but that we dont need now  the Dark Knight ufff and that soundtrack  papa buenisimooooo and finally  HE IS BATMAN,Positive
Dragonball is a great adaptation to a great anime series Im a true fan of the show and I absolutely loved this film I really liked how the characters were portrayed Goku was great he plays a high schooler with chi chi Throughout the entire film they both have a love connection between each other My favorite character was Piccolo The actor portraying him did a great job Bulma plays a tough fearless character really well too Yamcha was good master Roshi was great and so was Gohan The story is basic Goku comes home only to find that his grandpa was killed Goku then realises he must collect all  dragonballs before the eclipse But in order to do that he must defeat Oozaru and then defeat Piccolo The effects were really good the acting is phenomenal the story was great and the character development was really good I hope we will see a sequel I highly recommend this to die hard dragonball fansYou have the power levels of a Boy Scout troop Freiza,Negative
One of worst written and directed big budget movies Ive seen in a long time Made Transformers look like Seventh SealIt starts with the  minutes of narration at the beginning to try to make the rest of it make any kind of sense This fails Then there are the other obvious reshot or dubbed lines to try to make things make sense These also failForget the black ops CIA agents easily defeating humans armed with machine guns then throwing their guns down and turning their backs when confronted with some dinosaurs trained to literally run up and bite them Forget that the controls for the mainframe that needs to be turned off is in the same room where they kept the experimental grasshoppers and which had been soaked in lighter fluid and set on fire earlier Forget that restarting the mainframe also brought the grasshoppers who were burned to a crisp hours earlier back to life Forget all that and answer this Did Kayla steal that airplane from Baloo from TailSpin Its obviously the same plane did she pay for it Do talking bear pilots exist in the Jurassic Park universe,Notr
The mission was simple come up with an entertaining followup to The Matrix in particular of interest to a loyal following at least those fans not feeling burned by the two inferior sequels But half of the Wachowski team of socalled visionaries ended up shooting storyboard content that makes little to no sense alienating those fansThe general outline of the movie is there but the connections between the real characters of Neo and Trinity with their representations in The Matrix are confused and very confusing So one sits watching lugubrious soulsearching melodramatically sentimental the power of love scenes punctuated by busy SPFX and action scenes that are so typical of the publics acquiescence in recent decades to mindless superherocomic strip fantasy and violent visuals,Notr
Ok so its no classic but its not that bad Enjoyable enough to watch if you take it for what it is The effects are good The story is a little basic but like I say its ok The worse thing about the film is what comes after it the post credit scenes two of them just dont make sense and felt really hurried,Notr
Anybody who is a fan of Dragonball will be extremely disappointed with this movie Even if you arent a fan this movie is still just awful The story has absolutely no structure and does not even have the slightest resemblance to the series it is supposedly based off ofI watched this movie and being a fan of Dragonball It was painful thats the only way I can describe it The story is extremely clich and the plot and theme is less than mediocreBeing an avid fan of the series It is hard for me to say this but this movie is a  They did not follow the story of Dragonball they simply took the Title and the Names of the charactersI can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen Or it is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen I am shocked to hear they want to make it a trilogyWhat a shame and what a disappointment,Negative
This movie is entertaining For me that was goodIve watched all the other Jurassic movies but Im not a huge fan to where Ill nitpick every detail Im not expecting to see some thought provoking mind blowing movie with this one I was entertained and would recommend to anyone else wanting to watch the movie,Notr
Hey just watched this movie with family and it was great Not a history breaker but a great lightweight movie to have fun minimal violence fits everyone over  many references to this crazy mobileapp World we are living inI liked the characters most loved Jailbreaker and poop I also liked the world Emojis are living in The story has some lightweight teaching too,Negative
I think Mobius is cool The chemistry between Mobius and Martine is kind of awkward I just dont buy it In fact I really like Milo because hes sure and evil But the characters motivations are all over the place I am just not sold with any of their convictions At the end it felt like a cliff hanger where none of the characters are fully developed especially the detectives Martine and Nicholas even Mobius himself Milo has the best arc Overall character backstory are like  covered and doesnt explain much Thats not a movie by any standard More like a tv show,Notr
I enjoyed reading Stephen Kings short story Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption from the book Different Seasons more than watching the movie However its still one of my favourite movies of all timeIt has very few peers and has to be seen It is Awesome,Positive
Great graphics and cute Its a cross between Inside Out and Reck it Ralph The jokes arent funny I hardly laughed at all Im  yeat old female and watched it on Netflix It is boring,Negative
Heath Ledger and Christian Bale are absolutely phenomenal in this movie,Positive
Honestly this movie is probably the worst Ive ever seen The whole idea is creative and couldve been such an amazing movie but it was lacking a lot of things like the plot and dialogue The visuals characters and setting was terrific It was visually appealing and all the apps and emojis were very imaginative and well done but the dialogue was cringe and the plot was confusing A lot of it didnt make sense and the good parts of the movie sadly dont make up for the bad I dont think this is a suitable movie for young kids as it involves social media and a lot of other things that only teens would understand but it is a pretty lame movie for older kids and adults Dont waste your time and money on it,Negative
My review is  so I feel I can say anything I want because who on earth is going to see this oneThis was the most exhausting movie Ive watched in recent memorySo many chases  all with animals of course Dinos The first hour had so many nonstop chases that it was actually exhausting to watch Id have to stop and go do something A little bit of this a little bit of that Then back to the chase If it had a motorcycle in it it was Chris PrattThere was one scene that was very much like the bar scene in Star Wars So all the big movies now are borrowing from Star Wars If Tom Cruise in Top Gun  could do it then so could they Itll be interesting to see how many more movies copy Star WarsThat said one can only hope that if enough of us point out that we actually see their plagiarisms and call them on it maybe we can get some original movies out of Hollywood What a concept,Notr
First  its a tough act to follow  but they did a pretty good job with this I enjoyed it A good follow up and continuation of the story Only thing it really really really needed  was the real Morpheus and Agent Smith All that said though  it was still definitely the weakest of all Tye Matrix films I wis it would have been a home run  but it was a base hit at best,Notr
So catslets talk about this thing and waste even more of my time with writing this and yours by riding itbut since i wasted part of my life by watching it lets gocats is one of biggest failures of entire year and that means in every single way possiblelets admit it what can we espect from a film that doesnt have plotand entire cgi and visual effects are really hard and disturbing to look athell i felt sorry for actors like dench and mckellen to be in this but it was their decision they choose for whatever reason probably moneycats is proof that stage musicals dont work in films and it is wasting everyone time and patience with its existance,Negative
Amazing movie that every film enthusiast should watch beautifull story characters plot cinematography its an all around perfecvt movie the only downside that i can see is that they spend around  years in the prison and look the same throughout the whole movie but that is just a very small detail that will not tkae you out of the movie and you can enjoyit ver nicely if you dont think about it Morgan freeman portrays a very good side character as in red that is the figure of reason because andy is new in the prison and needs somebody with experience to guide him through his stay behind bars very good movie that everybody should watch regardless of everything this review means nothing is just had to fill  characters take care,Positive
I know I never got to see the musical but I did listen to the original songs And I absolutely hate the new music,Negative
After watching the cancerous Tumor that is the emoji movie I have finally come to a revelation all western animation has gone to absolute sht I have giving up on life And I should end it before the fidget spinner movie trailer is released and the fidget spinner  emoji movie crossover I could honestly make a better movie with my ass and compared to this movie it would be an Oscar winner God is dead Kill me,Negative
Remember all of the animated classics Brilliances and captivating viewing experiences that have entertained us and will continue fascinate generations who will continue to watch these classics long after I and indeed you have left this plane of existence where there will be sequels to all of the following evercontinuing sequels which never get stale Classics like Your Iron Giants Your Cowboy Bebops Your One Hundred and One Dalmatians Your Fists of the North Star Your Fantasias Your Grave of the Fireflies Your Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs And your Neon Genesis EvangelionsWelp Tear em all down Animation is deadI was hoping to have off myself before the release of the meme movie but thankfully for all of humanity and those who care about me it has since fortunately been canceled after the relentless mocking of this piece of infringement of our human rights Its worst sin in my eyes at least is that the Popeye movie which I was pretty excited for the first time I saw it I was overcome with nostalgic memories from when i would watch old s Popeye cartoons and now the Popeye movie wont exist we traded it for the Emoji Movie,Negative
Inception is a summer blockbuster that actually makes the viewers think Finally a director and crew realize you can make a film full of explosions and awesome slow motion effects with an actual complex story This is not your Michael Bay summer blockbusterIt is very refreshing to see that even though Nolan has rebooted the Batman franchise he isnt losing sight of his own original ideas Jonathan Nolan Writer obviously deserves a lot of credit for making a believable script that isnt campy and full of one liners throughout Even though there are a few but it is necessary to keep the balance of film from being one sidedThe film is a modern classic that should not be missed Whether you like Nolan or not there has to be credit given to the cast who made this insane thrill ride feel absolutely real throughoutAcademy Awards are looking promising,Positive
This movie has got to be one of the best adaptations of an anime ever OK so Justin isnt that great of an actor he still succeeds as a teenage Goku and his hair is fine Imagine an actor wearing a giant spiky mess of hair it just would look too goofy Im glad with the way they went with it Bulma was definitely bulma ChiChi was a little off missing her anger issues and Yamcha was kind of lame But Roshi was the Roshi we all remember minus being balled If you nitpick this movie then yes you will be angry but if you look at the movie from a technical side compared to other anime movies this owns I recommend seeing it and I cannot wait for DBZ,Negative
It has nothing in common whit the dragonball animation series Its a totally different universe they just stole some ideas and characters from it and turned it into a ridiculous childish movie Off course dragonball is made for children but in the animation series the makers created a deep and very interesting universe whit extremely powerful characters who combine martial arts whit fantastic powersWhen i watched that series long ago i really wanted to be like those charactersi wished i could make my hair turn yellow while flames cover my body and all the dirt flying up and started spinning around meI was expecting the same feeling from that movie i know its not easy to replicate that but they didnt even tryDragonball deserves a serious movie really based upon the fantastic universe we know from the animation seriesDont bother watching this,Negative
Fantastic that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made This movie has everything from dark humor action to the most dark and horrifying scenes it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker he is definitely the best joker ive ever seen he did it so on point its fantastic Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and its without a doubt the best batman movie ever made,Positive
If you are a fan of Dragon Ball dont even waste your time with this piece of junk It is not only a bad Dragon Ball film but a bad film in general,Negative
Masterpiece  a must see I wonder how can some reviewers give it a low score every moment or the movie is well articulated you enjoy each and every scene the actors are phenomenal Jared deserves an Oscar for his performance,Notr
"Ive watched great movies The Godfather The Lord of the Rings Trilogy Citizen Kane Casablanca Lawrence of Arabia The Mummy  The Green Mile Silence of the Lambs E T the ExtraTerrestrial  A Space Odyssey etc Inasmuch as they are outrageously great none of them come close to this absolute masterpieceIn a world where theres so much despair so much crime so much death and destruction you would think theres no light at the end of the tunnel But nope This movie reminds us that despite the trials and tribulations we face everyday theres one thing that cannot be toppled
HOPETo live without hope is to cease to live  Fyodor Dostoyevsky
Get busy living or get busy dying  Andy DufresneThis movie in my own opinion is the greatest movie of all time",Positive
Great music superb actors It is a pity that Forrest Gump which I consider another masterpiece  went out the same year and got all the publicity as well as the Oscars It was not fairThe only reason for which I rented this movie two years ago was because of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins But it was a big surprise to see one of the best films ever made  I have seen it  more times since then It is a story of COURAGE PERSEVERANCE TRUE FRIENDSHIP HOPE AND REDEMPTIONITS A MOVIE FOR ALL TIMES A MEMORABLE ONE EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE IT YO WONT REGRET,Positive
I watched it as I enjoy the dragon ball cartoons and comics and thought it might be interesting despite a lot of negative reviews etc but lets look at it for what it is No its not going to light the acedamy on fire and it is not going to go down in history for deep plot and script writing The movie is fun and when you think of the challenge of bringing manga comicsanimation to live action thats a big task I thought the realisation of the characters was good and the elements they have taken made for good story telling There is life in the movie and the enevitable sequels can get better I will most likely buy on release as it is something fun to watch on a slow weekend afternoon If you want a martial arts epic watch Legend Enter The Dragon or Hero if you just want to sit back and be entertained this is not a bad choice,Negative
Guys do not follow the other reviewer just watch your self the movie and decide it I watched it today and well it was worth watching if I may told you that it was like a Wreck It Ralph movie the difference is that Wreck movie based on the inner world of games and these emoji movie it was based on Chatting Apps where we find ourselves many characters to send to communicate with others without wasting on writing well this is all I have to saydont ignore it watch and enjoy Thanks guys,Negative
Ok The CG is horendous and the story is literal trash I wouldnt want my kid to watch this movie,Negative
A long running Broadway play with multiple awards An A list cast What could go wrong Apparently absolutely everything I have already wasted too much time on this film to waste anymore typing about it,Negative
"Who thought it was a good idea to make this 
The Idea of combining cat and human with CGI is terrible and all those cat humans looks like an adults stuff of nightmares Never mind for children",Negative
"This movie is great
But its overrated
Its directed from one of the greats
Amazing script
Stunning score
And obviously an amazing cast
Aaron Eckhart is doing amazing
Michael Caine has great delivery
Gary Oldman is good
Maggie Gyllenhaal is a vital part of the movie
And obviously Heath Ledger is perfect
But Christian Bale is putting on the worst performance of his life every time he shows up as Batman in this movie I genuinely laugh because he sounds hilariously bad with a suit that looks terrible in good lighting or when hes not moving and the first scene of Batman talking to Commissioner Gordon is exactly that",Positive
My son and I watch this almost daily He loves it and I love it,Negative
Honestly amazing  watch it all the time Really good Love a good thriller Simply one of those films where you turn off the lights grab some popcorn and enjoy Characters all work amazingly well story is structured fantstiscally and I often tend to rewatch on repeat If it was on youtube I am sure my viewings would take it into the high millions Would watch over and over it is a film to rav about The story works so well so fresh and gripping I think it deserves more recognistion and loads more awards Please rerelease in cinema It would be amazing to experience it again and have that moment,Positive
I felt Dominion was a bit of a Mish mash of Jurassic Park and Jurassic world We had similarities to both trilogies but not too much that was new and that we had not seen before Even the ending was similar to Jurassic World  I felt like the editing was a bit choppy and it all felt a bit rushed Ive heard a directors cut is coming out so I do hope it will tidy up the film It was fun and great to see a mix of the original and sequel casts coming together I look forward to seeing it again when released on blu rayiTunes There were alot of special dinosaur scenes which I loved but the fact that the films story stretched too so many areas I think this spoilt the narrative a bit and brought you out of the journey from time to time I cant wait for the release to own and look forward to the directors cut,Notr
I havent seen too many movies that I would rate a  but I had no problems giving this one top scoreMoviemaking seems to be like golf for a truly excellent game ALL the elements must come together Everyone involved must have perfect form Director Darabont must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together Of course the actors were excellent Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable and bad guys dont come much worse than themThe other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning middle and end So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong Not so with Shawshank Redemption Just like Goldilocks said This is just right Buy this one for your home collection because youll definitely want to see it again,Positive

Great superhero movieI think this is the best Batman movie that has been created so far The leading actor who plays the Joker is believeable and draws you into the movie The storyline was well put together and award worthy,Positive
Great film Well written with very well developed characters I loved the ending and how it rounded off the story very nicelyControversial opinion however perhaps I expected more from the movie and walked into it expecting the best thing I have ever seen because of the ratings Maybe not knowing how well the movie has been received might have made me enjoy it moreEither way really fantastic film,Positive
Couldnt do it I walked out the first  minsWhy sis the directors think this was a good idea,Negative
I enjoyed this movie a lot So real facts and unforgettable,Positive
Only to beat it with a stick and bury it six feet under It was so long and slow Too much talking not enough actionI didnt feel the energy behind what was supposed to be a revival of an iconic storyNeo and Trinity gave off a tired almost senile aura as opposed to the iconic characters I once knew and the entire movie felt like a romance instead of a sci fiactionI do not understand why this movie was made Why did they have to bring Neo and Trinity backAlso this movie rode on the back of the trilogy too much instead of holding up itself the story was overthought and confusing not in a good way If I were you I would skip this and rewatch the original trilogyBrb gonna go cry ,Notr
This movie was as expected Bad If done differently they had a chance of making this an enjoyable movie But they only made this for money So they didnt care weather it was good or not The plot of the film is cliche and the characters themselves are too It deserves the hate it got I would never watch this again in my free time,Negative
This is not my kind of movie If I want to speculate on what is really happening Ill read a mystery novel something I almost never do anymore I dont enjoy a movie that forces me to try and figure out the plot Not that it should be totally obvious from the beginning but this was just too much head work for me and I could tell that it was a puzzler early onI go to the movies for entertainment  not to solve puzzles After  minutes I walked out I was not entertained and I knew I wouldnt be After seeing thousands of movies I can usually tell quickly if Im going to like itBut thats just me I can see how others thought this movie was great but you must remember that its not for everyone Im not a fan of Matrix or Tron either so you can see why Im not interested SciFi and puzzles are fun for some not for me anymore,Positive
A scientist trying to find cure for a rare disease and turns into something he did not want friend turns to enemy well I would say it is a great entertainment I liked the movie though slow progress of the plot The ending has few clues for what might be coming next Actions are good and acting is superb,Notr
I cant say much more than I was incredibly underwhelmed by this film Perhaps it was that I had been told what a great film it was by all and sundry but I found it utterly average  I am afraid I just didnt get what was so fantastic about the movie  Dont get me wrong it was an entertaining film but not the masterpiece I was lead to believe it was Sorry,Positive
"First time watching this movie I cant understand whats happening in this movie after  to  minutes its blow my mind I really appreciate all the actors acting especially Leonardo Dicaprio
thats a very good movie",Positive
"Pros
 The story expansion is remarkable The human real world details are based on current discussions about future From that aspect it is really very contemporary The new state of machinehuman interaction is very very futuristic The text and conversations that including programming terms and computer science are at a quite high levelCons
 There are too much new details and flow is too fast Many details are being covered so fastly and slightly because of movie length despite it is too long That is why i couldnt understand clearly and feel to rewind at many points This film absolutely should be  part One  hour film is not enough to cover everything Fight scenes are not at an enough level Both from amount and content aspects KungFu scenes are not enough attractive and artistic Keanu Reeves was much more serial at Reloded and Revolution Tension is absolutely the most absent thing in this film in comparison with trilogy The flow is going on a plain level Level of energy is low generally",Notr
Im kind of wondering what people were expecting This is pretty much a CGI  Cats with a few weird additional changes some pacing that could have been faster and some less impressive vocals But honestly I dont understand what was so upsetting Has anyone seen the original It makes very little sense to begin with Its a musical about Cats that has honestly defied all logic for decades anyway If youre a fan I feel like you got what you were expecting It was FINE Not great not awful Fine My biggest complaint was Jason DeRulo robbing the Rum Tum Tugger of literally everything that made the song and the character what it all was but other than that calm down Seriously This was not the worst  hours Ive spent in a movie theater this year I can name  movies that were more painful,Negative
Many say The Dark Knight is the best superhero movie ever made I am not agree with that The Dark Knight is specially Movie with a super hero that have elements of neonoir heist movie gangster and crime drama Essential picture that made a revolution in some way in movie industry Everyone remember july  and that hype for TDK Before explosion of social networks internet was full of stories about this movie Everyone talk about it in gatherings In different vibe than first one this sequel deliver some dark story that dont want to be for Hollywood stories Simply story in old school way that not sell audience some characters and theri life in some comerical way that is buying audience for money This masterpiece simply got money for on classical way of storytelling Movie that is on the top for  years Movie that cinephiles and new generation talk about And never get boring Masterpiece in all way,Positive
I felt like Im wasting my time with this movie really All of its plot is based on very simple idea yet this simple idea fails to convince me that its somehow possible in real world or necessary for heroes to accomplish or this movie is supposed to teach me something or relay the message Come on I was on the edge of my seat when I was watching The Matrix going WOW several times and I was never disappointed and what a simple yet powerful message this was With Inception I felt like watching The Prison Break series episode  The movie provides absolutely no answers why I should bother to worry if they deliver the thought to the poor sobs head which they drugged on the plane I simply dont care if they succeed or not No immersion In general words special effects were good streetbridge bending animations were good yet I was bored the whole time  out of  for this pointless flick which I forget in few weeks,Positive
I dont know why all this hates floating around for this movie but the thing is pure win Start to finish it captures the essence of the Anime and the emotions I felt when I first watched it like  years ago I felt like a yearold watching Dragonball Z all over again They took all the goofy fighting goofy animation epic plot lines crazy characters and condensed them amazingly from what would have probably been like a million DBZ episodes to a minute film They even had a minutelong charge sceneSeriously dont listen to all the crap on here Go watch this movie and try to be a kid again,Negative
I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked except the animated ones or the quasianimated like Sin City You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common but in the end theyre trading in different kinds of imagesThis is basically just another Batman movie Same silly premise that a superrich hero battles  over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city  villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosivesI will agree that Heath Ledgers performance is amazing Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie It is a real pity that he died I cant help but thinking that if he were still alive and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent this movie would not have an average rating of  as of this writingThere are a lot of other fine actors Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine for crying out loud who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriouslyI did like the heist sequence at the beginning including the Jokers first few lines and the bit with the bus Really very droll gets your hopes up But from then on its just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst  dark brooding comicbook angst,Positive
This movie is so bad i dont want to watch the last  mins of itit has promoted content and i dont even understand how the wanted to realese thisi think most people hate this fcking title and i hope streaming services will take this down forever,Negative
Gene couldnt be meh but this movie made me meh Turned it off after  or  minutes and I was watching it for free One of the worst things recorded to film Ive ever had the displeasure of letting come into contact with my cornea,Negative
Awful sound editing left me wishing for subtitles Heavy reliance that people will either have watched the trilogy again before viewing or possess a fantastic memory to link all the callbacks Plot is very thin and the visuals are nothing special,Notr
My god what has Hollywood done How did this idea even get the go ahead to be made Timeeffort and way to much money was used for this movie Dont waste your money on this Dont even watch it as a joke This movie is Sonys terrible reboot of a Disney classic Wreck it Ralph Also Hollywood stopped reviews for this movie a day before the release so that way more people can watch it giving them more money thus giving directors ideas that they should make a fruit ninja movie Conclusion Put a bullet in my head Just shoot me please,Negative
This movie is not just horrible it makes any true fan of the actual series rage Plot is absolutely atrocious characters are ridiculous and stupid and doesnt follow the cannon what so ever It makes no sense and gives you a pain in the pit of your stomach This movie is trash mindnumbing shite that doesnt deserve to exist Any true fan will hate this movie so watch it only if you plan on wanting to die   if I could Waste of my life and yours dont watch it,Negative
I wonder why many people think this movie is a flop but i actually like it Pls apreciate the animators,Negative

It is a timeless tale of hope and resilience that remains deeply impactful to this day Set within the confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary the film intricately weaves a narrative of human spirits triumph over adversity and the enduring power of hope Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver captivating performances infusing life into their characters and making their journey truly unforgettable Under the skilled direction of Frank Darabont the films storytelling unfolds seamlessly drawing the audience into a world of despair and redemption Through its exploration of friendship injustice and the pursuit of freedom The Shawshank Redemption resonates with audiences worldwide leaving a profound and emotional impression that lingers long after the credits roll,Positive
I truly am sad that this film was done the way it was Everything was less than average for  The story telling and CGI were the worst part of the film Someone who worked on The amazing spiderman  mustve worked on Morbius because it has very similar flaws which reminded me of The amazing spiderman  the whole time I was watching Really sad,Notr
If you watched the trailer and couldnt tell that this movie would be a steaming mug of garbage juice then its your fault for going to see it I gave it  stars instead of  because at least they tried to warn you,Negative

It risky to take this type of movies Becax huge things have to create and exicute

Dont Miss it",Positive
I had to leave the theatre in the middle of the movie it was so dreadful that I didnt even want to finish watching it The story line is terrible and the movie is not entertaining It is much more suitable for a younger audience than for adults This movie was way worse than I expected considering the low ratings it was already given,Negative
How many ways can I list why this is best movie of all time  The most perfect ending of any movie Ive ever seen   Best story  Steven King not even a fan of his   Best acting performance Morgan Freeman absolutelyamazing best ever Tim Robbins is brilliant also   Best narration  Morgan Freemans character   Most uplifting touching moving story ever told   Outstanding soundtrack   Beautiful cinematography   Most evil antagonist  The warden  Best dialogue  so many memorable phrases and quotesI could keep going  Ive never encountered a movie that has touched so many people,Positive

Dont understand the super bad reviews and hate for this movie I have never watched the musical so had zero expectations I thought the movie was quite entertaining and a fun watch for the whole family My  year old nephew suddenly got out of his seat and started dancing when Rum Tum Tugger was doing his thing The kids got a good laugh out of the silly antics of Jennyanydots played by Rebel Wilson who was essentially playing herself in all her other movies Dont get me wrong I LOVE Rebel Wilson Inthink shes hilarious Absolutely loved Ian McKellans performance as Gus and his presentation piece to contend for the Jellicle Choice CG was able to gift this movie with realistic feline twitches and movements for the actorsIve seen some reviews claiming there is no plot Its quite simple you got a bunch of cats who are contending to be selected as the chosen Jellicle to be whisked away to a new life in Heaviside Layer Wheres Heaviside Layer Who knows Its just some place a bunch of cats made up Ultimately this is a movie about  well Cats And the mystical  magical lives they lead,Negative
Im still not really sure what I watched I feel like nothing really happened in this filmFor a  hour film there shouldve been more of a climax or resolution Its very light on action and the action that does transpire is lackluster to say the leastI enjoyed the start of the film excluding the unnecessary retread of the original films opening The White Rabbit sequence and everything with Neo questioning his existence was compelling The meta commentary was okay at first but seemed really out of place the more they hammered it home The constant flashbacks to the original were weird and just reminded me that I couldve been watching a better Matrix filmKeanu is as watchable as ever and the relationship with Trinity is solid stuff I enjoyed Groff and NPH quite a bit in their roles The recasting thing was odd and the explanation is pretty weak but the actors did as well as they could having to live up to some iconic performances Im not a massive fan of the franchise but I still expected something more from this film than empty nostalgia,Notr
Thats really oOosm  the acting of joker is op level His performance made us fall in love  changed peoples thought about villian Unfortunately he passed away before releasing of the film Its too sad because we could have watched him making another great movies and also gathering fame popularity         ,Positive
I saw Cats on stage over  years ago and enjoyed the music but thought it was a weird story My expectations were low going into the theater this morning and when it was over my friend and I just laughed at how truly horrid it was The CGI is beyond bad and Taylor Swift needs to NEVER act again Seriously she was the worst her accent was painful to listen to The only redeeming part of the movie was Jennifer Hudson and her big number The ending was laughable to say the least The sad thing is there was so much talent in this movie and it was just wasted on cheesy CGI and painful to watch cat moves Tom Hooper you should ashamed of yourself,Negative
The worst movie I have seeneven not worse commenting onjust do not waste your precious time on it terrible humor I would say no humor at all  terrible quality though with nowadays technology and possibilities could be much better  after watching the trailer supposed to be cool original and funnybut the trailer in fact says all about the movie so you can end up there,Negative
I saw this at the first showing and bought the Bluray the day it was released I dont know why everyone is so afraid of change It was a great movie the acting was good the effects were great the costumes were amazing and the changes were enough to make the story interesting to someone whos read the manga and seen the anime like me A direct adaption would have been boring This version changed stuff around and made it work While its true it could have used a few more characters from the original stuff that still seems like a fairly minor complaint as more characters would just mean theyd have to introduce them which would bog down the movie And to the people who complain about hair color what works in animation doesnt always work in live action and thats a REALLY minor thing to complain about,Negative
Have you ever read the story about the Emperors new clothes Its about two weavers who promise an Emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those unfit for their position stupid or incompetent When the Emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes a child cries out But he isnt wearing anything at allA dream within a dream within a dream with Cobbs played by DiCraprio wife as an intruder in his subconsciousness and if something goes terribly wrong you enter the state of Limbo where youre stuck in ones raw subconsciousness Sounds really deep and complicated right It really isnt The plot of this movie may as well be a new metaphor for those clothes that nobody could see There isnt a deep philosophical meaning behind it Its just made sound complicated enough for the viewer to be expected to draw a philosophical meaning and understand it The viewer who is able to do that is smart enoughPeople pretend to extract some philosophical meaning out of it and therefore continue praising it They do not want to be the stupid ones The truth is it is only an OK action movie it has good fighting scenes and good acting but is too long for its own good Its time for people to admit that the Emperor is really naked,Positive
I do not even feel as though I need to go into a great amount of detail to explain just how amazing this film isYouve probably seen the movie sitting on the top spot of IMDBs top  or maybe youve heard a friend babble on about how great the movie is and know it must be halfdecent I can assure you this will live up to your expectations The acting the plot the setting the cast the directing the messages and symbols the acting again deserves another mention is just about as perfect as a movie can be in this setting Please dont waste your time pondering over whether or not to see this movie or whether or not you should believe the hype because I can assure you you can Go buy this from your local movie store or buy it online  I really dont care  just make sure you watch this film before anything else As an yearold guy I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen  or ever will see Go watch it Now,Positive
Watched this with a bus full of  year olds Thank you God for the experience of a lifetime and have a good day,Negative
I didnt believe that this movie was going to be as bad as other reviews said it was I was wrong After watching this movie I had to take a break from life I returned home and laid down on the couch and just stared at the ceiling I couldnt do anything and to be honest I didnt want to I started questioning the reality of this world and the future of animation Its safe to say that I became a hollow shell of my former self after seeing this movie Jitterbug echos in my head every time I close my eyes now thanks to this corporate garbage,Negative
This film is perfect in every sense of the word The second the movie starts it grabs you and holds your attention for the rest of the film It is never boring All of the hints that lead to the finale is absolutely genius and the attention to detail is perfect The third act is the best of all time Roger Deakins gives one of his more subtle works and it plays out beautifully The dialogue is perfect and you deeply care about the characters,Positive
"Absolutely the most movie overrated i have seen 
There are movies that deserve this rated and have not been talked about As for this movie it is worth watching but it does not deserve this rating",Positive
So lots of people are gonna say how bad this movie But if a great amount of people said this movie was good that other people would hop on board the band wagonBut I actually liked this movie it was enjoyable,Negative
Worst movie ever My kid didnt know what to say when I asked him at the end did you like it The answer was Ill tell you later This movie is hard to be understood by kids less than  years old they have to know about dropbox twitter or firewall I am happy i dont have to see it again my kind never mentioned anything about it,Negative
Its horrible dont watch it The only good thing about it is that its consitant Consistantly bad,Negative
the year the greatest movie to exist on this site was createdto bad you moviegoers disagree Godfather Part I is a classic but get real you cant defy this movie  It may get slow at points but it overcomes that with amazing cleverness and a few tricks up the directors sleeve If you see or have seen this movie you will find or know that this movies brings out many surprises,Positive
Man I just finished The Shawshank Redemption and let me tell you it hit me like a right hook from Red himself Heres the thing Im  fresh outta a brutal breakup and feeling lost like Andy Dufresne in that prison yard But this movie man it gave me a flicker of hope a spark to fight for my own freedomIt aint about some grand escape though Andy pulling that off was pretty damn sweet Its about the tiny victories the chipping away at the walls metaphorical and literal that confine you Like Andy carvin that chess piece outta soap bit by bit year after year Thats the resilience I gotta find you knowAnd Red man that dudes got wisdom dripping off him like rain Hes seen it all the good the bad the ugly and he aint lost his hope He tells Andy Hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies That line man it stuck with me Its like a lifeline a reminder that even in the darkest depths theres a chance to claw your way back to the lightNow I aint sayin Im gonna tunnel out of my apartment with a rock hammer but The Shawshank Redemption did something for me It showed me that even when youre stuck even when youre beat down theres a way to fight back Its about finding your own hope your own way to crawl through the Shawshank of your own life And maybe just maybe find your own redemption on the other sideThats what this movie left me with a yearold with a bruised heart but a newfound spark in his eyes And hey if Andy Dufresne can make it maybe I can too,Positive
A kids movie especially kids who love watching youtube and who like play on a tablet or phone will loves this movie My eight year old son loves this movie Dont take the negative reviews from adults seriously,Negative
What can I possibly add to a review corpus of over  million ratings and three thousand reviews This movie has been called one of the best movies of all time a powerful story about friendship hope and freedom and a latterday retelling of the Gospel story Many people have seen this movie multiple times and some claim it has changed their lives and even saved their livesAt this point Im rather more interested in the phenomenon than the movie My take on it this movie appeals enormously to ordinary people especially American men who feel trapped by difficult situations in their lives Some may be looking to be rescued like Red was others may take comfort in the thought that their longterm pain tedium and oppression will someday result in a spectacular liberating event This movie satisfyingly scratches that annoying itch called life is unfairIts difficult to know what to think about all this Whatever you think about the phenomenon Shawshank Redemption is also just a good movie with excellent writing black and white characters a simple but satisfying plot with a few surprising scenes great acting and a certain amount of tear jerking Its not a movie to be missed,Positive
Jurassic Park was wonderful Very good adaptation of Crichtons novel The sequels Meh and more meh And Dominion is a perfect example of how Hollywood has one good idea and then beats it into the ground over and over because they have no imagination or creativityThe best thing I can say about Dominion is that I got to watch it for free so I wasnt out any money on it,Notr
The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent film from director Frank Darabont whose admirable in making this story based on a book by Stephen King Tim Robbins gives a great performance as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman is equally impressive as Ellis Boyd Red Redding two imprisoned men looking for redemption who bond after many years while dealing with not only the abusive corrupt prison guards but the violent fellow prisoners amongst them as well Robbins and Freeman had good chemistry together which made their growing friendship that much more believable on the screen The rest of the cast including Bob Gunton Clancy Brown William Sadler Gil Bellows and James Whitmore are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time The pacing was a little slow at times and the running time of  minutes made the film feel a bit long but the rest made up for its few flaws Overall despite its flaws The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a must see a movie that cant be missed It has a compelling story character development drama some humor and exceptional performances by the cast especially Robbins and Freeman who make this one of the best books by Stephen King that was made into a movie Well done Much better than expected,Positive
Annoyingboring and so may advertismentsjust a waste of timeits so baddont watch it,Negative
Want to watch something without having to really pay attention Here you go Storyline is ok not great characters arent very interesting and female characters are fairly sexist But if you just want to have back ground noise it works,Negative

"Basically dont bother it only got a  rating because I couldnt pick a 
There is no plot to be seen and I cant believe the cast list signed up to this film because they didnt make it anymore watchable
If you have cat or can borrow one watch that for  hours instead of this film because it will be far more enjoyable

Alex is a boy trying to connect with classmate Addie through his phones messaging app Textopolis Inside the phone each app is a world upon itself In Textopolis Gene is an emoji eager to follow his parents footsteps as another Meh He fails in his first attempt and in the ensuing chaos emoji leader Smiler sets bots to erase Gene Hi joins him in escaping into the world of the phone Hi leads them into a pirate app to find hacker Jailbreak to fix GeneThe start is good I like the old emoticons walking into the retirement home Despite the really stupid premise Im still willing to give this a chance hoping for some old Tron magic The start is simply a fake out as the movie deteriorates into nothing I couldnt stand it even with the very short  minutes worth of viewing The poop jokes are fully expected but still insufferable Why would Alex send the Meh emoji in the first place Its all bright colors and meaningless stupidity It may still be enjoyable for really young kids with their first phones They may have fun with this idiocy,Negative
When you wake up from a good dream you feel the reality is harsh When you wake up after a bad dream you will be sentimentally attached to the beauty of reality But as long as life is good reality and dreams dont matter,Positive
Loved this movie and most of the songs The CGI was mesmerizing The actors and performers in this movie should not have been ashamed I finally saw it and I loved it,Negative
After experiencing NOLANs earlier worksThe Prestige Memento  Dark Knight i actually have a faith on INCEPTION And guess what i was absolutely right INCEPTION is by most NOLANs finest combination of storytelling  action at the same time with same pace The amazing concept of dreams and thieves mixed up in a very cinematic way that take your breath away The very first frame of the movie itself told the audiences that they are watching something extraordinary HANZ ZIMMER awesome BG score keeps the movie alive and fantastic Visual Fx makes it more real and terrific in every senseso DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR go and watch INCEPTION,Positive
This film ranks second among my all time favourites The only reason it does not hold that coveted first place spot is that I am obsessed with Monty Pythons The Holy Grail Shawshank is a beautifully crafted film with one of the best endings I have ever seen even though in a way it is not entirely unexpected It is particularly enlivened by the presence of Morgan Freeman who should have won an Oscar for his voiceovers alone In a word Exceptional,Positive
This is a boring confusing instalment of a once beloved franchise Theres barely any dinosaur scenes Not substantial edge of your seat cinematic dinosaur scenes that weve come to love Very boring no real storyline,Notr
This movie was terrible thats all I can say Terrible horrible the worst movie Ive ever watched Thats all,Negative
Maybe for me and I think most of true Batman fans at first glance this isnt comic book Batman that I was expecting Its marvelous how Nolan succeeded to present in one movie Batman that is so realistic and that we can connect to it and really be pulled into movie and that he preserves all craziness of Joker that is demanded from his character Batman movie can be done in various ways and one reason is because Batman and his greatest enemy have no superpowers and I see that as a good thing because then you have more space and need to present these characters not as someone who can really exist but as someone who put you more into movie and unreal world of comic book at the same time He put this two things together in something that almost everyone would watch and like but without losing true representation of Dark knight,Positive
Dragon Ball evolution is an abomination to the history of live action anime Dragon Ball series are the best anime of all time and what we see here is a total mess of a masterpiece there is some nice special effect famous and appreciated actors and actress but all the magic of dragon ball is everywhere but in this movie Nothing is like the original few peoples are missing and have nothing in common with the original dragon ball This movie is more powerranger like than what we enjoyed during our childhood they do not deserve any money for this movie if i could i would give it a minus  in fact i register here just to post this comment Hollywood stay away from japan,Negative
Filmmakers that plan to make use of Stephen Kings writings in the future need to pull an Orson Welles and watch this about  times before they get into it And read the short story just as many times This is the best transfer of a Stephen King story Ive ever seen I would give it to Kubricks The Shining but its more like Kubrick took the story idea and did his own movie on it In other words while its a classic its not that great of an adaption Andy Dufresne is wrongly imprisoned for murdering his philanderous wife and while in prison befriends a prisoner named Red who is great at getting outside products to the inmates The message of the film is strong and clear  Hope Hope Hope is a beautiful thing The film is about triumph About friendship Its also about some knockout acting Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at the top of their game A Must see Especially if you are a fan of Stephen Kings short story,Positive
THE EMOJI MOVIE IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME THERE IS NO MOVIE BETTER THAN THIS IT DESERVES THE OSCAR FOR BEST PICTURE IT IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIMEI mean come on Stale jokes Patrick Stewart as a turd  product placement a plot that goes absolutely nowhere lack of common sense anywhere throughout the movie Oh sure the FORMULA for a Best Picture winner I SERIOUSLY wonder just what exactly was going through the minds of the people who worked on this Lets be honest among movies considered the worst theres The Room which quite frankly puts a smile on my face and then theres this loadocrap a systematic braindrain Like I could actually take The Room seriously compared to whatever this was Hell The Emoji Movie shouldnt even have been thought of in the first place,Negative
People have been overcritisicing this movie like if all movies need to leave a legacy for humanity You can simpliy go enjoy the music and disconnect Nothing in the movie is real like Star Wars either so stop criticising the humanlooking cats Jennifer Hudsons interpretation is outstanding and the cast of singers and dancers do a great job Francesca Hayward is lovely as Victora James Corden however looked a bit disconnected from the character and was two much James Corden The story goes fine until we have seen about  of it and goes down turning too slow then it manages to recover to have a decent second part I dont regret it Maybe its because I like musicals,Negative
I was absolutely shocked of how amateur some of the scenes and editing was This movie honestly looks like a fan parody movie I love the concept of The matrix and the characters but I could definitely live without this installment And I anxiously awaited this arrival only to find it sadly disappointing,Notr
Ive seen the first scene of the movie in my nightmare beforeit was bad and boring and i paid fifteen dollars plus popcorn and i think it was the first movie i watched in theatre all year,Negative
This was amazing On the genetic aspect the movie might be thin but on the ecological aspect this movie hits hard The way it depicts the beauty of evolution and the importance of coexistence is incredible Coexistence is something humanity needs to do with the rest of the planet to achieve balance and prevent all the world threatening problems I know that there are a lot of negative reviews about this movie but what I am saying is this movie conveys a really tough message It is a true science fiction film not like the superhero movies which are made just for entertainment It not just a movie its an emotion,Notr
Cons The movies pacing is slowthough it fits the tone and plot That said its not quite deserving of the top spot in the greatest films of all time rankings The Godfather has earned that title hands downIts also a missed opportunity not seeing Red with the harmonica That wouldve added something extra As for the Brooks storyline it drags on unnecessarily a few minutes wouldve sufficedPros On the plus side the film exceeds expectations especially with its plot twists Every scene sets up one thing then delivers something entirely differentkeeping you engagedThe ending Its one of the few that actually sticks the landing The Shawshank Redemption nails itThe final act really takes the intensity up a notch making it an exciting finishFinal verdict an  out of  Not quite a  but its still a solid pick,Positive
Like many other out there who have been reading about all the hype Inception has been bringing the World Wide Web and possible your friends I got to the movie theater as soon as I could to watch it And let me tell you this movie has a whole new twist It is not a cookie cutter plot it doesnt have a theme you have found in another movie it is just flat out unique and amazing No wonder it took Nolan  years to release it The acting in this film is just flat out outstanding After watching Cillian Murphy in The Dark Knight and Batman Begins it was hard to picture him acting in any other type of role But this film just pushed the bar up a few more levels He does an exceptional job with this film Dont even get me started with DiCaprios performance You can just expect that to be great and let me tell you IT ISNolan choice to pick actors from the Batman Series Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy was a risky one Its hard to picture these actors in another type of role after watching the Batman Series especially the number of times I have rewatched them But nonetheless High Risk  High Reward and without a doubt is this one a high rewardThis movie will literally Blow you away Its worth every penny I watched the movie in D and it was great Take your family Thats what I did Everyone Loved it It will be a great experience and if you dont decide to go see it yourself I bet someone eventually will make youOh and trust me youll have a hard time falling asleep and dreaming in the movie theater with this film ,Positive
If there was a way to rate this a  it would still be worth a negative This is such a horrendous movie that holds zero likeness towards Dragon Ball other than a name and character names Aside from those things this has zero to do with what Toryiama createdWith the technology we have these days there should be an effort to erase this from existence and do right by the franchise with a real and legit live action worthy of the Dragon Ball name,Negative
I didnt know this had anything to with marvel so no expectations on the whole this is a good movie with interesting story I love vampire movies an this hit the spot okay there wasnt head ripping or blood everywhere but okay scenes I think it should have a better rating I think if it wasnt connected with marvel then it would have done better I would much rather watch this than spiderman or something because this was little darker and just more my type of movie I have to say there is kind of a batman feel obviously because of the bats I would like to see more of Morbius as series or movie,Notr
Even though the nostalgia can be too much and heavy handed at times the Matrix Resurrections is the best Matrix sequel so far an appropriately meta stylish and surprisingly funny film thats also got plenty of heart and interesting new ideasKeanu Reeves gives an incredible lead performance with plenty of charm and is once again able to anchor the films more surreal and pretentious moments CarrieAnne Moss is great and has strong chemistry with Keanu Yahya AbdulMateen II is effortlessly cool and suave and Jessica Henwick gives the best performance out of the new charactersLana Wachowskis direction is really good its visually slick with well filmed action set pieces even if they arent as satisfyingly clean as the previous ones The CG is mostly impressive and the music by Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer is also really good less hitech sounding than the previous ones,Notr
Unlike the massacre thats going on here I think its a good movie Not great not bad but good There is even something to be said about its interesting approach to trauma denial psychosis and delusion Worth a watch,Notr
This film did exactly what I had hoped it would do The end of the third film it shows the love and sacrifice of Neo and Trinity not only for each other but for all of mankindThey also showed how the current architect of this new Matrix the so called Dr Is much like our current president He understands humans so he uses fear of the unknown against us He pits us against one another and sets back and smiles at the chaos hes causingThe best part though is this movie allowed for both Trinity and Neo to be equal Cause lets face it without each other neither of the two would have survived without the other,Notr
If your reading this Im gone now If ever a movie could make you feel any emotion this is it never have I wanted to punt a baby panda for a field goal never have I ever felt that Sony is a sellout when making the movies Like any Adam Sandler movies So if your reading this Im gone now to a far better place so dont cry for me Im already gone,Negative
This movie is hands down one of the greatest films ever created Meticulously plotted boldly directed emotionally satisfying and grand in scale are just a few ways to describe this colossus of filmmaking Heath Ledger easily surpasses even the hype with a masterclass screen devouring performance Christian Bale Maggie Gyllenhaal Michael Caine Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are also incredibleYou need to see this movie at least once in your lifetime  go see it now,Positive
Shawshank Redemption has been elevated in popular opinion to the status of masterpiece because of one irrefutable virtue It is accessible Regrettably as is true in so many cases popular opinion is an inaccurate gauge of this pictures actual quality The reason this film has attained its current level of acclaim is that it is impossible to misinterpret its theme or message impossible to be offended by it impossible to be confused by However as this review should show it is entirely possible to be unimpressed by ShawshankThe story of Shawshank Redemption is something I might expect if I was being pitched a script by middle schoolers The complex coincidental frameup the daring escape the clear cut definitions of good and evil the timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummated on a beautiful shoreline Each step more unsurprising than the last each beat more clichd that the last Every time the filmmakers feel like building tension or revealing something about the characters they take the most obvious road This might be excusable if the road didnt also lead to the most obvious destinationsPeople also praise the acting in the film While it isnt at all bad its hard to be impressed when the actors are playing such simplistic roles Stereotypes when acted well are still boringI sincerely hope that over time when the film has settled into history and once people are more able to set this pandering film along side its heavily plundered predecessors it will become clear that it offers nothing new and that what it does offer it doesnt even offer all that well,Positive
Strong meaningful and everlasting message is what makes this movie such powerful The Hope the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature But lots of flaws also This movie lacks originality Approach characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold Portraying of characters is loose and poor Dialogues are pretty ordinary and too conventional Overall approach is just Routine and  the whole movie is based on the Final Impact of  the story In short its actually not surprising no Oscar winning and no including into the  Greatest Movies by American Film Institute Greater Effort in developing characters to be multidimensional and story to be less conventional would produce One of the Best Pity ,Positive
People were already prepared to hate this film so just low rated it  its a decent CBM  trust me Sony has done far worseI have to hit  characters apparently,Notr
I have never commented on a film but living as movie lover a great movie lover Ive always been seeking for finest fine movies movies that cant be forgotten that would give a meaning to me The Shawshank Redemption it is a movie that I cant say anything about it else than powerful wellmade and meaningful to me as God as my witness to this moment I havent seen any movie better than that  It was recommended by a dear friend of mine but I never took seriously until I watched the first thirty minutes of it then I regretted that Ive never attempted to watch it before that moment Hope something good never dies I have hope that I believe in and I believe that someday that hope will get me through life The Shawshank Redemption gives hope and thats enough for a movie I dont have that great knowledge of movie but I do believe that this is one of the finest movies that were ever made,Positive
Style over Substance might be a KneeJerk Negative Reaction to this Messy Film But that would be Kind There is no Style or Substance to Waste many BrainCells Considering The Movies Conceit is to make You want to Think Think NotIt tries so Very Hard with its Explanations about Dreams dont do a drinking game taking a shot every time the word dream is mentioned you will be dead by intermission Also Wordy Incomprehensible Insertions about the Teams Method used here to Infiltrate and Control the Minds of Corporate Clients now there is a group we can morally supportThis is so Unnecessarily Complicated that it causes Viewer Fatigue and by Proximation Sleepiness early on and Waking Up or Recovering from that is not a Given The Result is just not Caring about Anyone or Anything that is happening on the Screen What is happening is kind of Drab and Dull for a DreamscapeIf you buy the Premise and go along for the Ride better fasten your SeatBelts because it is anything but Smooth It Bumps and Jumps from Dream to Dream and Layer upon Layer of Intellectual Gobbledygook that is so Very Uninteresting and Without much Pathos The Music is forever in Swelling Mode and Ripples throughout and is Pretentious and IntrusiveIn the End some have trouble making it that far there is a you decide Twist that is not really a Twist because after all You Decide But it is hardly Worth it and when all is Said and Done too much has been Said and not enough has been Done Vastly Overrated,Positive
An absolute fail to remake some classic scenes from the st movie There were plenty of flashback elements but obviously done really bad It looked like amateur made fan movie on the whole Sad for all the great actors to be part of this parody,Notr
After watching the film I was disappointed It really turned out to be a halfsequel halfremake of the original film  that is the main story is almost the same as in the first part even some scenes are copied almost frame by frame only some details are changed and new characters are added which cannot be compared with the old onesThe original Matrix still looks better and passes the test of time it is better to revise it well the whole trilogy at the same time,Notr
Burning your money for the ticket would be more enjoyable more intelligent and more entertaining than Emoji This movie is totally dull and a waste of time The plot is predictable and poor And it is absolutely not funny There are stupid movies that are at least somehow entertaining This one is just boring nothing else You have been warned I suggest that you save your money and watch something else,Negative
A awful film to watch will give you a headache and some brain damage,Negative
The story is an completely sucked out theme that is used like  times already the jokes are just awful and i really needed to skip the last  minutes because i just couldnt watch it anymore This is probably the worst movie of  the scary thing is i wont even be surprised if they top this one in even already  or something What could be worse than this Well they managed to make an movie THIS bad so who knows what they still can root up,Negative
I dont know the comic nor what to expect from this new Marvel story But I was definitely intrigue by the synopsis And after I watching it Im pretty satisfied Its not like other superhero movies Its much darker than others Now I dont know what problem those  stars raters have but as someone who doesnt have any expectations of this movie I find it quite amazing Dont believe the ratings watch it for yourself You might like it Or even better love it,Notr
I dont understand the bad reviews Ive never reviewed anything before but thought I should because this doesnt deserve its current  My  year old loved it there were plenty of jokes to keep adults entertained it was switch your brain off and scoff popcorn fun which all the best kids films should be I also thought there were a few clever observations Dont take modern life so seriously,Negative

I thought this movie could be atleast a little bit creative but it isnt in the sligthest I found my self having to use my phone during the whole movie cause I was so bored Very lousy job of Sony animation studios,Negative
I was very tempted to walk out half way through the movie It was just terrible Everything about the movie I am stunned that anybody gave this pile of garbage more than  star,Negative
I wont repeat the ravings by others about this Movie yes thats a capitalized M Ill just share with you my experience watching it on CNN last month Im a graduate student and midterm week was approaching I constantly said to myself Ok Ill go to the library at the next commercial break  but without me knowing it my butt was glued to the seat after the first  minutes and by and by I forgot I was watching a film Finally when it was over I was left tearful and speechless It was that powerful an experience I even feel that my life is enriched so much more after watching the film Those  hours are worth every second of it I can tell you that,Positive
It was so bad even Twilight was a better love story The jokes werent good The story doesnt make sense And the characters actions were too predictable most of them taking stereotypical clich roles Waste of time and money The Hotel Transylvania short was  better than the movie itself,Negative
this day and age the age of cellular technology is taking over the lives of the younger generation making them more incompetent in the real world any child with a smartphone today would say that they would rather lose a lim than go a day without their smartphone and how can people refrain children from constant use of their smartphone lets make a movie pretty much encouraging them to use their moile phones with the constant use of these emoji while we make a ton of money on the side why because f the younger generation and there future actions wont affect me and my millions cheers,Negative
I have never seen anything more despicable and utterly terrible than this majorly stupid motion picture I wish to be freed from this imprisonment this movie continues to pummel your personnel with Life was much more better before i watched this film please for the love of all that is holy and swell in this godforsaken woe ridden world end my perilous misery this instant First of all I must note while watching this movie of the which back tracks at the very least  years in human development my poor dying grandmother infested with diseases beyond comprehension started gasping for the air of life I looked for the source of these gurgled releases of air from her illridden lungs and soon realized the ailmentss originality had been due to the movies magical terribleness Also because gramps unplugged the CPAP but Im certain nay positive that this movie was the cause grammys early demise,Negative
It seems theres an actual consensus for once on IMDB everyone hates this movie and rightfully so Its terrible and nobody wanted it much like the latest Star Wars Avoid this at all costs or at least try some hallucinogens but Im pretty sure youd have a bad trip,Negative
Obviously nothing is ever going to be as good as the original Jurassic Park  and every film since hasnt been but theyve all been good This one is also good It kept me glued to the screen Maybe a bit of nostalgia is making me a bit biased but it kept me entertained isnt that what a films meant to do,Notr

Im a massive fan of the original trilogy so I was exited about this but it ruins the other matrix films It even has to have a bugs bunny reference to just imply the film was a big joke and now Im annoyed that I had to give money to watch something that feels like a ripoff of great movies I cant understand why Reeves was in this film It doesnt even have good stunts like the old trilogy it just feels like a spoof or a ripoff of the trilogy and youd at least think the directors would keep remotely same ideas but no just a waste of time and money for everyone that made it and watched it,Notr

I know this is supposed to be targeted to kids but was dragged to see this movie This is really what happens when Hollywood cannot come up with new ideas for a movie consider this a throwaway movie The voice acting was not great and there really wasnt a plot to follow Wont be surprised if this becomes like the Rocky movie do poorly and come out on Bluray and DVD after a short amount of time Would not recommend anyone see this movie take your kids to SpiderMan again just avoid this movie,Negative
Very very overrated film Worth seeing in the cinema for the visual effects but would never buy the DVD The acting is good but the content lacks a truly engaging story line It lures you in but never manages to hook you They shouldve explored other characters rather than Cobb It seems to me as though the film couldve been pulled off with a less talented supporting cast Also it is slightly confusing in some parts Other parts are way too predictable This is NOT the MIND BLOWING film people talk it up to be Those people out there who say this is a GREAT film are mistaken Although in saying that it stills scores a solid  Cam,Positive
I just dont get it Ive just seen it and was actually reluctant to go after reading quite a bit of negativity about it BUT its actually not bad Its a solid  I was entertained the set prices were great and the old and the new cast blended well Go see it expecting to be entertained and youll have fun,Notr

This movie is a fine way to spend  minutes but is by no means a movie of the first rank The script is far too simplistic clichridden and predictable The characters are far too good guybad guy dualistic and for a story purporting to take place over the course of  years there is remarkably little character development And just about every really evil character gets his comeuppance whereas the people were supposed to be rooting for end up in clover HmmmmAmong prison movies Cool Hand Luke is bettermore realistic and without the obligatory Hollywood feelgood ending Runaway Train and Papillon are also very good certainly more interesting Among inspirational movies last years October Sky is a better betIn a nutshell tremendously overrated but certainly worth seeing,Positive
This piece of garbage movie would make Chris Evans Fantastic  look good The movie made no sense this movie brought nothing to the MCU It had to much CGI Id rather watch Green Lantern on repeat the even attempt to see that movie again Sony needs to sell the rights to Disney because they are just destroying their characters and its only going to get worse I would not count this as a Marvel movie this movie is quite literally a joke If your looking to hook up in a movie theater but are on the edge about doing it because there might be people this movie is for you because there isnt going to be a single person in there,Notr

I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London it advertises itself with the slogan Biggest screen in the UK which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre this still is able to blow someone away Great visuals combined with a great story and superb actingThe movie could also have been called The Joker but even with Heath Ledgers great performance this still is a Batman movie And The Dark Knight is clear enough even without the Batman in the title I simply loved the movie but I heard some complaints from some friends It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters I loved Heath Ledger but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier or the plot threads especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books I still stand by my vote This is the best Batman movie ever until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one,Positive
Very few movies that made me cry  and The Shawshank Redemption is certainly one of them I remember when I first went to see this movie in my freshman year in college The movie made me appreciate freedom and true friendshipVery powerful picture indeed and each actor deserved an Oscar for their great performance It is sad that the movie did not get the true scale of recognition it deserved but being on the IMDb top  movies of all time based on peoples votes is a great way to show the well earned appreciationIf you did not watch this movie yet then you missed a lot,Positive
I am pretty sure I have watched it more than  times now  and I will watch it a  times more shared the experience of this work of art and recommended it to many many people because i felt it will be selfish to keep it to myself The movie is ageless timeless and pure it sticks with you forever The shawshank redemption isnt just a movie it is a feeling,Positive
This movie has no story and the Anime is much better,Negative

So my friend was like Lets go watch this new movie about some vampire Jared dude And I was like Aw hell yeah a vampire thats sick When we went to the theater I was hopeful to watch a good movie But what I didnt know was that I was gonna watch something even better No medicine can make you fall asleep faster than this movie TRUST ME If you wanna watch this movie Watch it before sleeping Trust me youll have a wonderful reset,Notr
Mixed bag of greatness and mediocre A really enjoyable blockbuster for what it is has some poor dialogue in some scenes and a little cheesy bits with the boss of Bryson The cast though is excellent cinematography is amaze balls and theres plenty of awesome high budgeted action sequences throughoutI loved a lot of it though I must say its great fun especially in IMAX There was even a great QA I got to see was silly when someone said finally when that ended I was thinking why pay for the longer version with extras if you dont want to see that aspect some dont make sense I crave any special feature Id work on film if I could and Id say Jurassic World Dominion is a worth seeing,Notr
Horrible plot Dinosaurs were simply windowdressing for a locustmovie and everything else was simply pandering to memories hints at and copies from previous titles in regards to characters actions I had to force my way through this one and it left me wondering When they watched the final cut before release how can they step back and be happy with what theyve made,Notr
This could have been something enjoyable but it fails to generate any interest TJ Miller I always find entertaining but his voice over character is not giving much of any interest neither does any of the animated characters You really dont get infested into there doing Trying to hard to be another Wreckit Ralph and you can see how hard it was tryingNow the animation is pretty to look at showing life inside an IPhone But if thats all the movie has going for it Only children can be forgiving of this but adults not so much,Negative
The three previous Matrix you could sense the fear the humans had when entering the Matrix or interactions with the machines These new characters treated it like it was their neighborhood playground and had no worries of death It was laughable I said characters because I actually dont even remember none of their names,Notr
The Emoji Movie  by Tony Leondis while often criticized holds a special place for many including my daughters who genuinely enjoyed it Its a vibrant fastpaced adventure that brings the digital world to life with colorful animation and a positive message about embracing your true self even if youre a meh emoji The films energy and simple humor resonated well providing a fun and engaging experience for younger audiences Its a lighthearted escape that proves entertainment can sometimes be found in the most unexpected places,Negative
This film was great its the best superhero films with its drama action and suspense The Joker was truly one of the best villains ever Heathe Ledger gives you chillsIts the film where clichs dont exist Nothing is repeated This film has great direction and not just bombs guns and explosion Many superhero films consist on action and stunts cheesy story and weak dialog However this film has a really edgy and a really well done story The special effects were just amazingA couple of scenery from the film I just didnt like didnt make me feel the darkness But that itActing was really good and not corny at all And for the writing is excellent,Positive

This movies is a masterpiece by one of he greatest directors Christopher Nolan And he made it in some way that the twists and turns are the best of the best of the best I also appreciate the actors in this movie I especially liked DiCaprio Tom Hardy  Gordon Levitt,Positive
The new Jurassic World movie has got to be one of the worst big budget hollywood film I have seen in quite a while The old returning actors are not enough to save the clunky dialogue or the absolutely pointless story here As a conclusion to this trilogy it fails in a majority of areas Worst of all in addition to being sloppily put together is its beyond derivitive I honestly feel like Ive seen the majority of these story tropes used in a vast catalog of other much better films Also it has one of the worst villians Ive seen put to screen His acting and the dialogue for his character was about the equivilant of a  year old throwing a tantrum Beyond annoying and even more unrealistic The special FX werent even anything awesome just more of the same However I do have to give it up to the team that did the creature designs for the practical FX those were more impressive I would recommend waiting for streaming it wasnt even worth seeing on the IMAX as the majority of scenes were not worthy of the scale  a dino out of ,Notr
I would give it  stars only because of Keanu otherwise the movie was bad Truly bad I dont believe this movie can be a part of the initial trilogy There isnt any place to compare at allseems with time we lose good movies which is sad,Notr
Vamp movie with no blood I know only very little about the Marvel stories I havent heard about this character until I saw the trailer a few months agoI always liked Adrias and Jareds acting so I was excited about this movieI went to pump up my blood pressure with some good actions Well my BP stayed at  It would have been even lower if I hadnt drank  liters of cola in my boredom And believe me Im very easy to pleaseIm sure lots of work went into it and its definitely not  However as much as I really wanted to enjoy it after  minutes I could have told that would happen in the next  minutes even with close to  knowledge of Marvel charactersThe shirtless scene was nice  lol  I gave an extra star for that The actors did their bests I guess the CGI and the makeups were fine for me and there were a few great sound effects and cam angle shots as well but the music lacked of creativity and I really missed the action the BLOOD and exciting wow scenes which would have made me want to watch it again It wont happen unfortunately,Notr
Okay obviously people feel the need to be utterly sarcastic and ridiculous about tearing this movie down but I didnt think it was that bad Honestly people there are worse movies like Inside Out Chicken Run Angry birds and every recent live action Disney remake Sorry but the live action Beauty and the Beast Aladdin Lion King and the rest are patheticIs The Emoji Movie a cinematic masterpiece No but it has a decent albeit predictable storyline with a positive message about embracing who you are I would definitely choose this over some of the other garbage that passes for childrens movies these days,Negative
The emoji movie is a very rare type of movies that are so bad you can watch them twice and still have a good laugh If i could vote  I would The movie itself is meh Actually its worst as meh I dont even know why Sony made one in the first place This movie is worse than world war  and the room and thats a hard act to follow If they decide to make an emoji movie  then I quit The idea and movie itself is meh actually its worse than meh its abysmal,Negative

Three of the four stars are for Jeff and the dinosI only watched this in the cinema because a movie group chose to but after the last two i was not at all interested in seeing this movieThis movie was soWhite all the supporting cast actors were BIPOC but the story focuses on some of the whitest white actors out there and while this wouldnt bother me so much its a yearold franchise and they are still soWHITEIf anything its fun to see Jeff Goldblum be Jeff Goldblum and the dino scenes are a good time Just download it,Notr
I saw a trailer of this film and i thought it looked brilliant and when i watched it it was brilliant it was full of action from start to end and i think the actors portrayed the characters very well If anyone says this film is crap they have no sense I dont see why people have to be so picky with how the characters look This is supposed to be a bit different and it is and it does it well I also thought the special effects were awesome It really is a great adaptation of the manga series I cant wait for the sequel to this film It will be brilliant My mum also enjoyed the film as much as i did Some people can be hard to please,Negative
Even OG cast couldnt save the atrocious storyline I guess the writer completely missed the mark on what we fans were expecting The last movie Dinosaurs escaped to mainland and now humans and dinosaurs will need to coexist Its like the writers didnt even see what happened in Jurassic Park part  lost world where TRex caused havoc when loose on mainland This movie shouldve been more of an apocalyptic feel humans trying to survive GovernmentArmies failing safe zones being breached and overall carnage where the OG cast somehow ends up reuniting to come up with a plan to save human speciesInstead we get the same crap as the last  movies a fancy secure building that gets breached a rich greedy CEO and everything just falling apart as usual No purpose for OG cast to be there Super lazy writing and screenplay No originality feeling Felt like a hotpodge cash grab messOn positive side visuals were stunning,Notr
I read the reviews for this film because the rating was so bad  at time of writing The reviews were so bad that I had to watch the filmI was very surprised this film isnt bad at all In fact as far as stage musicals transferred to film go it is good better than good even I think the problem is that the reviewers that gave this  didnt actually understand what they were watching Its a fantasy musical its supposed to be fantastical As for the reviewers that said there is no plot or story Cats doesnt have a plot or story because its based on a book of poems about different cats,Negative
If not know to you the movie does not go with the anime at all its horrible There are You tube videos better then this movie I really wanted to see this movie be good to wwwanimecrazzynet now has parts of the movie but its crappy If you like the anime hopefully you will outcast this movie I thought it was going to flow well with Dragonball this movie is a distracts to all Dragonball or DBZ fan around the world I was sad when I saw it made me thing a group of high school kids could make a better move then this now it sound like Im totally dissing this movie and i am I would not pay to see this movie this movie should end out with those Atari  ET games,Negative
Grasshopper thats all I have to sayIt tells me the review needs to be  characters so Id say this is the th to th best Jurassic movie there is If you want to watch a movie about dinosaurs this isnt the one,Notr
There were points of it being really great  notably the beginning But so much of it is poor transitions followed by confusing dialog I found myself rewinding to see if I missed something multiple times  but no I hadnt missed anything The transitions between scenes and the editing in general is just badAlso WB needs to stop promoting themselves in everything they do Space Jam  Only Disney is allowed to do that  WB is no Disney Which to me is just another sign that their franchises need to dieIn the end it is a decent flick with some good performances and an alright storyButTHE MATRIX is not properly RELOADED it is not a REVOLUTION and has not had any RESURRECTIONS haha,Notr
As a long time lurker on IMDb Ive slowly been working my way through the top  I can honestly say that this film has surpassed anything I have ever seen before despite the hypeI was gripped from start to finish An amazing concept backed up with emotion and even some groundbreaking action scenes I spent the entirety of last night trying to get my head around what could have actually happened such is the depth of the story Never before has a film had such an impact on me  I woke this morning to the realisation that I had several dreams last night which were very uneasy for the first time in yearsThis film is the reason Ive finally signed up to this website Im a massive fan of films such as The Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather but in my opinion this raises the bar And thats coming from somebody who is generally not the biggest SciFi fanIf theres ever a film that the masses should rush out to the cinema to see it is this before its too late An absolute must see and it would be a travesty if it did not make its way to its rightful position in at least the IMDb top ,Positive
Best movie and director ever i hope see more movie from this director,Positive

To paraphrase the great Dr Ian Malcolm they were so concerned with whether they could make five Jurassic Park sequels that they didnt think about whether they should make five Jurassic Park sequels What a piece of junk the latest one is Its plodding and predictable It offers nothing new just supposed homages and Easter eggs Thankfully I have Regal Unlimited Two hours and twenty six minutes long and it felt like four hours Sam Neill doesnt seem to realize hes supposed to be playing the same character that he did in the original Chris Pratt is more annoying by the second I sincerely hope that his MCU role is almost at an end Didnt Bryce Dallas Howard have a promising career at one point And she and Laura Derns Ellie Sadler are total badasses Until they have to walk over some bugsthen the shrieking begins What crap What tripe What an utter waste of time,Notr
seems like the comment on the front page was written by someone who must of been paid by the studio Jesus It wasnt that good dude Get a life or at least get out of Malaysia The movie was trying to be too many things It should of focused more on just being a action movie and not so much psychodrama Heath was brilliant but Nicholsons Batman was also great I couldnt see myself watching this again Once was enough And the Batmobile was down right bizarre It didnt look like something created by a rich man like Bruce Wayne I liked the performance of Eric Roberts as well as Heath Ledgers I believe the last batman was better as a followup on this day Aug th  I have watched the movie a few more times and YES it is a GREAT movie If grew on me and even after I met Gary Oldman at a highschool football game and commented on how well this movie plays on repeated viewings because the acting is so good he agreed Heath was brilliant and the movie does work on many levels I rescind my previous review,Positive
I dont know what i saw i swear i have not idea I rather watch Gigli and Catwoman Halle Berry version on a loop forever that watch this horror show again,Negative
The best movie ever made period I wont go on a very long and detailed review on the storywhich is magnificent and perfectI just want to say that this movie is a pure piece of art The acting was perfect Im really disappointed that the actors didnt have enough recognition for their performances Actually the overall movie was underestimate by the Oscars especiallyThis movie shows why cinema is an art powerful and heart full art See this movie youll now what Im talking about I really tried to notice some gripes or problems but I cant This movie is touching sad beautiful powerful and perfect By the way fk the Academy Awards for dumping this movie and do for Forrest Gump for the trophiesbut its just trophies Still a shame that they decided that out of ten totally deserves it,Positive
 because I have a wish I wish I havent paid  Taiwan Dollars to watch this absolute waste of a film What a screw up Its the worst film everJustin Chatwin sucks at his acting For once even  sexy girls Emmy ROssum and the sexy Japanese chick who plays Picolos henchwoman forgot her names spelling cannot save me from foul mouthing this goddamn waste of a film A literal waste of talent money time etc Only thing that keeps me from walking outta the theatre is Chow Yun Fatt he is as cool as he is since his performance in The Killer I wouldnt ela borate much on how much this film sucked other users have already mentioned on that But heres my verdictWords possible to describe Dragonball Evo words  Absolute Waste of Time  words  Dont Watch It  words  Rip Off  word  suckedBye bye ,Negative
I watched this movie for free and I still felt ripped off I watched this with a friend and yet it wasnt funny This is a truly awful movie which shouldnt exist It could have been good Just look at the Lego movie Thats all the proof you need Dont watch this Just dont Patrick Stewart went from Logan to this Let that sink in before watching this,Negative

In The Dark Night Movie Joker in this movie is really a legend He is my favorite Character in this movie more then the Hero The Hero is the Batmen but most famous character is the joker the way he presents his character is mind blowing i always gonna miss his acting i wish he is alive so i can see him in more movies and more shades of characters Batmen is a Super hero but Joker is a Super Villain of all time Nolan is a great filmmaker who knows the core of emotions and character design his script and dialogues are amazing he is one of the best filmmaker of this century Many filmmakers learn filmmaking from his style,Positive
This movie had leveled up peoples dream with being upside down or floating city bending explosive things Han Zimmers score was perfect for this action dream movie But then I wondered why there os so much action That is what mades the film a bit corny but at least Christopher Nolan had done an excellent job to entertain the audiences,Positive
I love this movie sounds like its awesome I wish it got a better review but by me its a solid  To those who watched it youre lucky I only watched a th of it before my friend turned it off  But its still the best Just like The Last Airbender movie PerfectIt doesnt follow the story of the anime or the manga much which is kind of a minus but its a fine movie I think they need to make a sequel even though this movie was very very underrated As I said could watch barely any of it before my friend just turned the movie off but I might watch it again if he isnt around so I can write a better review But I REALLY REALLY hope you people reading this dont hate me for loving the movie End of review Sorry it was short,Negative
Dont let the title mislead you I am not going to bash the movie actually this movie is good only that the hype over the internetHeaths death and the Batman fansupport effected the movies overall rating too much I said this is a good movie But is it the best  Not even close In its own category it dominates most of the movies though probably as good as Ironman and better than the first movie Like most of the people I am satisfied with the film but there are a few criticisms that I can make about the fighting sequences jokers screen time and the process of the movie First I wonder why this film isnt called Joker Not only that Heath overshadows everyone with his performance he also has incredible screen time as well it is as if we are watching Joker as the main character everything revolves around him Maybe It was because there were too many characters in the movie with separate goals and purposes which also effected the process of the movie in my opinion The story sometimes advanced too slow and sometimes too fastbut too fast in general not allowing you to digest the theme fullyOne other thing is the fighting sequences the careography was not well made most of the time it was too blunt too dark and because of that hard to perceive Maybe it was the directors intention but it kinda disturbed me not being able to understand what was going onTo sum up it the movie was just like I expected but obviously below its hype with a few deficiencies a good movie in overall but definitely not a master piece,Positive
"Having read all the negative reviews I knew I just had to watch it

Hands down the best Batman that is and will ever be This is one of my favorite movies because of the three main characters Bruce WayneBatman Harvey DentTwo Face and The Joker Each character is different yet alike in so many ways and throughout the movie you to see why they become who they are Christopher Nolan did a fantastic job directing this movie and this will be a movie that many generations to come will enjoy Christian Bale is such a complex actor and you really see his character change so much from Batman Begins and you really see it in the ending scene of the movie He in my opinion is one of the best actors in the business and i dont think anyone will ever come close Throughout his movies you see all of the different roles he has taken and it is pretty amazing to see how talented he really is Hope to see Christian Bale win more Academy Awards because he is very deserving of them ,Positive
Complete and utter garbage A total insult to the anime unfortunately I havent read the comic but honestly what were they thinking When they first cast Justin Chatwin I knew I already hated the movie but then I figured I should put my prejudice aside and give the movie a chancewhat a mistake Its a total joke and as Ive been saying from day onewhat were they thinking casting Caucasians in these roles The graphics are very laughable Bulma has one strand of blue hair and brown eyes The screenplay is very poorly written There was noting compelling Fox to make this movie Then why put so much money into something made so halfheartedly And I could go on,Negative
This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichs and predictability Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities These artists show their capability to produce art real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you The Shawshank Redemption delivers muchneeded breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forgetThese artists show their capability to produce art real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you,Positive
I saw Cats at the New London Theatre in the early s with the original cast and was blown away Wayne Sleep even sat on my lap during one scene I was smitten My parents bought the gatefold vinyl and I grew up singing the songsSo when I heard it was being made into a film I was dubious How can you recreate the glory of a stage musical like Cats And then it was released to such bad reviews and scorn I really didnt know if I wanted to ruin my memory of the showButit really isnt that bad Yes its weird in places but I honestly dont know how they could have made it more realistic  its about singing catsI loved hearing all the songs again and I enjoyed it Worth a look if you are a massive fan of the show,Negative
I loved this film Its so good One of my all time faves I enjoyed the King Piccolo Saga of Dragonball which is what this movie was adapted from If you pay close attention they do have some stuff or pay homage to from the cartoon It has a great message always have faith in who you are for kids and adults alike Im not too big on DBZ cartoon but this film I totally love Cheesy yes Bad You could say But I absolutely love it,Negative

I love the Jurassic Parc franchise but there has never been much of a plot except people screaming and running away from those CGI animalsThe last installment is the same formula They tried to put some disturbing plot into play but it hadnt much of a use For me its all about the suspenseaction parts and some of the scenes were all bit the same thing I have seen before I think the best action sequence was the scene in Malta Well edited and amazing camera work I loved DeWanda Wise she gave a lot of flair to her performance Absolutely loved to see the original  have a big part in the movie Laura Dern cracks me up And Bryce Dallas Howard always puts on a great scary performance Plus points for the cast for sureI absolutely enjoyed myself for h but it wont be my favourite one of the full installment Still more than recommend to watch this at the cinema,Notr
I enjoyed this one more then any other sequal before this Its got everything The sleazy Tim Cook clone villain just nails it for me The CGI effects are better then most of ots current competition It cotains some solid action scenes and a few subtle funny moments as well Though it could have been a little better if they wrapped it up within two hours Its just a little too long And though the story is a bit predictable its different from its predecessors So if you just want to enjoy yourself without expecting a believable or deep storyline then this ones for you I recommand this one even if you only saw the original It simply does the job in serving its purpose,Notr
The only thing good about this movie is a couple of the songs which are you know not original The reason I give Cats a  and Not a  is that I found some of the songs enjoyable Even if they were reused Bleh go waste all of your  lives Cats,Negative

Well Ive seen this film more times than I can count and honestly it hits me just as hard every single time Theres a reason this film is considered one of the greatest of all timeAt its heart its a story about hopehope so powerful that it can survive even in the toughest situationsWatching Andy and Red face the hardships of prison life only to somehow hold on to their dignity and dreams is nothing short of inspiringThe way the film uses its setting and characters is incredible No matter how bad things get theres always a way out if you refuse to give upLook at Andys fight against the system and Reds journey from hopelessness to freedom how often do we let lifes struggles hold us back without seeing the bigger picture Sometimes the real prison is not the wall around us  its the limits we put on ourselves,Positive
Like virtually everyone is saying this movie is terrible I cannot put into words how bad it is How anyone with the intelligence of a pebble can give it a star rating is mindboggling The humor is horrible the animation is mediocre at best and the writing is almost as bad as Norm of the North And that was also an incredibly horrible movie as wellIm not going to put any spoilers in this review Its not worth more of my time Read someone elses review for more info if you really want it,Negative
Greetings from LithuaniaIt is very hard to call The Shawshank Redemption  a masterpiece but it is a definitely one of the most inspiring and beautifully crafted picture off all time That said i wont going into details as plot and everything about this movie is so well known To simply put this is a story of two men in prison sentenced to life time and their journey to redemption Seeing this movie   times in my life i can say that when some time passes you kinda feel a need to rewatch it again because this movie is like a journey itself with characters drawn so sharply that we do care about them and the outcome is one of the most powerful and hope inspiring there is I brake every single time when watching sequence when Brooks gets out of prison and the whole sequence of living free  it is a powerful film making so say the leastOverall No at IMDb Top  says a lot  this is a movie that stays with you and inspires you not to lose hope It is flawlessly paced  at running time  h  min it never drags  it should be studied at film making universities HOW to create a film with no women characters when action takes place inside the prison and there isnt mainstream action at all Good things never get old and The Shawshank Redemption is one the fainest examples,Positive
I seriously do not understand all of these reviews that are giving this movie such a low rating Im not a kid nor do I have children of my own Im yrs old and usually dont watch animated films but I love this movie This movie is truly great for all ages As far as emojis go they nailed it with how technology is today This is one of those movies that just puts you in a positive fun mood every time you watch it If your looking for a movie that is fun and cute  then I highly recommend Watch a scary movie and then double feature this afterwards so you have sweet dreams and its perfect ,Negative
OK lets get it out of the way Im a massive Batman fan I loved the TV show when I was a kid really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions Ive even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one So how come Ive just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed Why Because this film just wasnt that good Its far too long has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously its painful The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought The whole thing was one great big dreadful noisy mess The only good thing in it is Heath Ledgers performance I had my doubts when I first heard whod theyd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath he pulled it off No thanks to the film however which is so over cooked its burnt Sure theres loads of action cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul It was great looking but has no personality I felt neither happy scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained I really didnt give a damn So next time people slim it down less is more Its not Apocalypse Now put some fun into itWhy so serious,Positive

Story Fourth part from Matrix Neo in machine world is game designer who has given world  games The games are the previous  parts of matrix Now they are again on the discovery to know the truth and fulfill whats missingCinematography The cinematography achieved during first  movies was of ace quality This part doesnt make it look fadingDirection I expected more so I would say it was an average effort from director LanaFinal Verdict I have always been great fan of Matrix trilogy It were kind of based on some Indian philosophies When the trailer first came out what came to my mind was concept of rebirth where Neo  Trinity are in Matrix and Zion is free To add further Zion is free to free for those who want to be freed A movie developed over such story would have been aced moreThis is where I say the effort as average The story puts love of Trinity and Neo first This is where it becomes easy to developI am happy that movie is available to stream on internet without letting someone wait So guys enjoy and spread positive word,Notr
Andy Dufresnes journey in The Shawshank Redemption is a profound study in endurance hope and quiet resilience Despite decades of unjust imprisonment he never succumbs to institutionalization or despair instead using his intellect and patience to meticulously plan his escape and ultimately help others find their own form of freedom His calm demeanor hides an unbreakable spirit making him one of cinemas most inspiring protagonists,Positive
If this movie was released a decade ago i would give a  star But after watching dozens of movies like Morbious it will be considered as an average movie Though it was entertaining but failed to produce a plot which is out of the boxDr Micheal Morbious was born with a rare blood disease which is leading him to death His mate Milo is also in the same situation as morbious is So Morbious sacrificed his life to invent the cure of the disease and found a hope with bat gene But experiment goes wrong and disaster begin to happen This is the storyline in simple words Jerad Leto is a genius actor and portrayed Joker in DC Universe But Morbiuos did not let him utilized his best as there were nothing in the sript for him But an intriguing situation will come at the end of the movie as Morbious is started to connect with the rest of the Marvel Universe Hope next movie will portray character Morbious more strongly and will use the best of Leto,Notr

it was bad as much as I would like to say it wasnt it really is only a one time watch movie and  if for some ODD reason youre an emoji fan than you would maybe like it but i dont know why because it has poor story line poor acting  just plain plain  plain BORING  glad I watched online and not wastes  dollars plus  on snacks at the movies they had a chance to make a better movie with this crazy famous characters  yet they throw it away almost like  the characters are so famous no one will care lets just throw it out there it will be great lets just continue milking the emojis of course having it on I phones  pillows  shirts isnt enough ,Negative
Really enjoyed this but when it came to the ending and it all went at light speed and really rushed Leto was good as morbius and the special effects were great too mat smith was good as milo but I just cant get around the ending being so off base its a shame really Hopefully the next one will be good all the way through,Notr

this was the worse adaptation to anything Ive ever seen i grew up watching dragonballdragonball Z and this was a terrible movie first off to start goku is on his own since he was a kid he met everyone in the movie when he was small master roshi was bald bulma had blue hair they couldnt even get the basics right then came the fact that this movie was so disgraceful to anyone who had ever seen any of the dragonball series it looks like the director caught  dragonball episodes and thought he could try and make a movie out of it if just wish someone who actually knew about the series would try and make a movie not someone who had no idea the movie didnt even mention that goku was a saiyan and what the hell does air bending have to do with anything this isnt avatar,Negative
I went to see this movie with my yearold sister She really enjoyed it Its the first movie she saw this year where she wanted to stay until the end I dont know why its been so harshly criticised its lighthearted and funny I would definitely recommend it for children they dont analyse the plot like they are some Darth Vader critics I must say I enjoyed it as well For anyone who watches it I hope you enjoy it as much as we did,Negative

Spoiler free reviewThere have been a lot of mixed reviews for this one including a  rotten tomato score from criticsIve just finished watching this and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it Now I do need to point out that if plot holes unrealistic set pieces and an underdeveloped politicaleconomicsocial world are issues then please avoid films with dinosaurs in the modern worldI also need to state that my expectations for dinosaur movies are Dinosaurs Dinosaurs fighting each other Dinosaurs eating people Pretty people to look atI was not disappointedIts mad fun its daft in places its thrilling there are some great throwback moments Its fantastic to see the cast together and overall its a great conclusion to the franchise so far,Notr
Since I bought a lot of years ago a videotape with two Stephen Kings short films one of them The Woman In The Room directed by Frank Darabont I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become one of the good directors in the filming industry and here we are with another Kings story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade s of course with the help of nonetheless but mr Freeman and mr Robbins who could have spoiled it,Positive
I really wanted to see this in the theaterhowever I never did last summer Instead I waited till it came on cable and after watching it I really didnt miss anything by not going to the theater I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman but I dont think it was I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes I mean Batman on the chopper really wasnt that much action A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then thatAnd I really didnt think Heath Ledger was anything special in this His role was just a lot of hype Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the endI also have to comment on Christian Bales Batman voice What was he trying to do He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysemaFINAL VERDICT It was good just not as good as advertised I dont get why so many people thought it was the best comic book movie to be made,Positive
When this movie was announced Emoji enthusiasts such as myself rejoiced Finally our most beloved property would be able to transcend its original limiting medium However this excitement was overshadowed by creeping doubt What if the poop emoji was not given a complete character arc What if the culturally diverse sushi Emojis were whitewashed and misrepresented by white actors And what if corporate executives censored the socially important twomenholdinghands EmojiAll doubts were dismissed upon viewing this cinematic masterpiece The creators respect for the Emoji community was evident in every frame of this immaculate work of art I laughed I cried I sat on the edge of my seat I repeated steps  countless times and finally I emerged from the cinema a changed man The unmatched humor emotionally complex tone and beautiful animation of the Emoji Movie left me with only one burning question who did this,Negative
This is just an average big budget Hollywood movieDont expect any complexity or depth from it it is simple and quite shallowTechnically its well done the plot is OK the actors are fine the FX are good and hopefully you will have a good time watching the characters running and jumping around ducking bullets and explosions and so on while a VERY SIMPLE AND QUITE SHALLOW psychologicalscifi plot unfoldsBut you wont get much else from itIm giving it a  So folks dont believe the hype about this thing being a fascinating and revolutionary piece of art because ITS NOT Its just another Hollywood commodity out to make big bucks If you want some enlightening psychology read  and dont watch this for cks sakeThere are some really cool effects to this film but the story is so convoluted that it detracts away from the story,Positive

The purpose of music is to incite emotion Musicals have long stirred emotions over the years Cats is one of my favorites If you go to the movie with ridged expectations of the broadway performances you will be disappointed However if you go with childlike wonder you will be blown awayI have been brought to tears several times The casting was near perfection Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella and Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy couldnt have been betterWatching my teenage sons glued to the screen was priceless This is a movie that will be added to our digital collection when it comes out It is well worth the money to see it in the theaters,Negative
I watched this ironically cause Ithought it will be bad but no I was wrongit was absolutely  So if you are going to see this pathetic excuse of a film give quadruple the amount of money that you spent on this film to charity to wash away your sinsso go see at your own risk and if you liked it youre lying,Negative

"Inception is a movie you just have to see before you judge it Maybe you should even see it twice There are a lot of complex ideas here and the movie spends a good chunk of time explaining them in the opening act
That main idea though is something very unique and creative that is brought to life by outstanding filmmaking everything youd expect from a Christopher Nolan film Writing and performances are also great across the board The only problem with Inception is in ones own interpretation Some may says its pretentious and the ideas presented acctualy arent fully understood by the creators andor dont make sense But I think thats a terrible angle to approach the film Its SciFi youre not supposed to overanylasie it in that way Its meant to plant thought provoking ideas in your head which I beleive it does very well not be a perfectly logical and plausible idea Yes it does have a few questionable sequences and scenarios esspecally at the end but it doesnt drag the rest of the movie down at all to me Its a must watch",Positive
The first Jurassic Park was a classic this one is not even closeThe scriptwriting and directing were atrocious  how could they release such an unfinished product Its painful to watch now that Ive seen it all in person because there are some truly cringe worthy moments where you cant help but say wowthey really missed the markCant believe I wasted three hours of my life watching this garbage The acting was terrible the plot was nonsensical and the special effects were laughably bad is shaping up to be a pretty terrible year for movies This has got to be the worst one yet,Notr

Inception is a work of bold ambition It is Nolans true masterpiece and one of the most original pieces of fiction ever put on film The story although multilayered and complex is incredibly engrossing and a wonder to behold on screen The movie follows Dom CobbDiCaprio as he leads a specialized team tasked with putting an idea inside the mind of Robert Fischer JrCillian Murphy This task is called Inception Cobb specializes in the Extraction of ideas from peoples minds in their dreams but Inception is an entirely different story Removing an idea from a persons mind proves easier because the person has already thought it but adding an idea is something that cant be done without carefully manipulating the mind to create the idea on its own This is the premise of Inception and thats only the surface There are so many layers to the plot that its almost impossible to divulge even a fraction of the story in any less than a few pages The script which took ten years to write is pure brilliance As the film progresses it only becomes more intriguing even up to the very end The acting is superb across the board The standout being DiCaprio but the entire cast delivers amazing performances Inception is visually dazzling and unlike anything ive ever seen on film But even the amazing visuals dont detract from the depth and complexities of the plot With amazing cinematography and a remarkably wellcrafted and fitting original score from Hans Zimmer there isnt an area where the film doesnt shine This is truly Nolans best and that is definitely saying something,Positive

Now I see what everybody was talking about It took me  years to see this in my opinion masterpiece If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are to me the pinnacle of both their careers This film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny Robbins Andy and Freeman Red are a balance of the human spirit Andy is your freedomseeking hope side and Red is your rational pessimistic counterpart Find your equilibrium in The Shawshank Redemption,Positive
This film is overrated Besides being accompanied by a score determined to set you to sleep theres really no filmmaking here that sets it above the restThe plot is very interesting and for the most part well conceived However the characters do too much talking simply explaining to the audience what the meaning of their actions are Why assume the audience is ineptThe basis of the plot itself is where film most earns its grade This is truly a unique idea for the screen Unfortunately it was denigrated by the unnecessary dumbing down of the story and the unimpressive acting of the castNo matter what the subject of a movie to end it with the question of whether it was all a dream or not is not clever,Positive
They spent a whopping M on this crap Tuneless musical based on a Broadway show and starring computer generated fur stuck around the faces and bodies of some actors singing too loudly The original choreography was dumped in favor of what the CGI could produceThe major critics have all lambasted this bomb and the awards season has pretty much ignored it Even Judi Dench couldnt squeeze a good mention out of any of themCritics have said the sets are ugly and the CGI flying bodies go all blurry Even the closeups of singers faces framed in CGI fur go all wonky if they move Its like a series of auditions in closeup or even worse cat night at your local karaoke barMost of the actors are blessedly unrecognizable but Ian McKellen Idris Elba Rebel Wilson James Corden Taylor Swift and Ray Winstone are all in this backally mess,Negative
This is the best superhero movie i ever watched the story of the movie is to deep and mang meaning in it,Positive
Brilliant technical wizardry Heady at least apparently so A ride more than a movie but a movie none the less Chris Nolan is rapidly becoming the director of his generation and Im longing to find out what is he trying to say He has established his technical power again and again but if I think of Memento for instance I remember the gimmick but not what the story was really about I suspect the same will be said of Inception Im not putting down Im just wondering I left the theater full of questions and nobody could actually give me any answers Im not talking about the plot but at the way Christopher Nolan chose to tell the story Leonardo Di Caprio is acquiring some extra gravitas as an adult presence on the screenLoved Cillian Murphy I always do Riveted by Tom Hardy Enchanted by Marion Cotillard Amused by Joseph GordonLevitt and delighted by Ellen Page I wonder what Mr Nolan will do for an encore,Positive
Being fan of Jurassic parts series as worth to see such movies on big screen and with audio setup i was the most disappointed person perhaps on earth with this episode of so called JP dominion It was the most boring and lengthy jurassic ride ever as many a times it put me on sleep I was shocked that they have shown that all dinosaurs are blind and that these tiny helpless humans are in just  feet away in front of them and they cannot see them and so they cannot eat them just beacuse they are main characters How stupid Directors and producers did a terrible job acting was totally an overacting and it was as usual and nothing new there except some pretty faces  was CG so just watch it as you are jurassic park fan otherwise you wont miss anything if you miss to watch it,Notr

This movie is amazingly bad A series of scenes which dont seem to have a real connection but angry dinosaurs being involved It seems like seeing the same sequence multiple times once in a city a forest a frozen lake but its basically all the same What really baffles me is the complete lack of character development Basically every character remains flat and ends up where he has been before This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time,Notr

"I went and saw Morbius in theaters today despite the less than mediocre reviews The movie had a great amount of potential yet lacked in execution The plot and effects were subpar but I still found enjoyment in the world the movie takes place in and the drive morbius has for finding a cure to his disease Despite being a marvel villain origin movie it lacks the feel of one Morbius is more of a light take on the thriller genre I feel that Morbius needed a better sense of direction or purpose as it could be all over the place at times I feel the movie came to a quick conclusion not letting many events develop into what couldve been Overall seeing this movie was a decent experience but not a memorable one I didnt feel any sort of attachment towards any of the characters as I dont think they had a very strong presence or importance Morbius is not a movie I would necessarily recommend to anyone that isnt interested in the movieConcept

There are those who seek to dive into your mind take your secrets and whatever else they find espionage conspiracy infiltration skulduggery through worlds that are all conjured well designed Theyve been asked to plant a seed start an idea change the course of an industrialists career but it needs dreams within deep dreams an architect to build the schemes and the consequences could be quite severeImaginative beyond words elegantly crafted and constructed presented and performed by legends of the screen with a great storyline that keeps the viewer constantly engaged and on the edge of their seat  what more do you want out of movies,Positive
I never ever give a  star rating having crawled out of the cinema after this monstrosity I had to give it the review it deserves I genuinely thought I had a migraine as the screen seemed out of focus and distorted everyone else said the same A hideous movie the visuals detracted from the music which was half decent some of the performances were dire I hate to jump on the bandwagon but the worst movie of Excruciating ,Negative

Ive seen it twice so far Inception is a fabulous high quality heist movie in which nothing is taken instead an idea is implanted in the mind of a markMurphy but also the audience Its also a journey into the underworldand calls to mind the story of Orpheus and Eurydiceand his journey to rescue his wife from death Cobb may not be able to rescue his dead wife but his obsession with her leads him in the end to making a journey deep into an Underworld where she has become a more vindictive character Like Orpheus Cobb cant return Mal to the world of the living he can only let her go Also another nice twist is to have an Ariadne who makes mazes But She is also the thread that guides the audience thru the storyshe asks our questionsshe goes all the way to Limbo with Cobb and her last words to him are words of advice to rescue Saitoas if she is implanting an idea in his mind What a great cast of characters playing off one another who lighten the tense story Loved the scenes in the dreams when the van is in freefall or rolling down the slopeas if in a dream Quirks like after Yusuf has righted the van he turns to share the experience with the passengersonly then remembering they are asleep and Arthus playful kiss with Ariadne The most novel idea the projections acting like white blood cells against the invaders,Positive
Without a doubt one of if not the worst movie I have ever seen Whoever made this should be ashamed Please do yourself a favour and never watch this ever Dont even mention it It doesnt deserve that The acting is so bad its not even funny The characters are so far away from the original you would have trouble thinking this is even dragon ball The plot Oh the plot Well it doesnt make sense at all There is nothing from the anime or the manga that resembles this The dragonballs were created by  mystics Um no Goku goes to school No Goku fights piccolo as a teenager Not the first time Goku is in love with chichi He didnt even know about girls until after his gramps died of natural causes There is just too much wrong with this movie I dont usually review movies but this was just so unbelievably bad I had to vent,Negative

I rarely blame the writer for a bad movie as more than often its the result of a studio or producers ego  but the writing was objectively poorThe industry has been so hot on Carmichael for awhile and honestly it seems like she had never even watched Jurassic Park or read Crichtons books It felt more like Fast  Furious plus dinosaurs with sappy dialogue and nonsensical plot points one after another And even though we have an army of characters that barely got any development the story insisted on introducing more which were boring additionsClearly this story also was pushing some agendas and its painful philosophical discussions make the OG movie sound like Socrates and Plato compared to this rubbishJust look at the ridiculous outfits Emily Carmichael wears to premieres and tell me this person should be writing the Jurassic Park franchiseIf youre going to make another Jurassic Park film get a writer who lives and breathes this franchise who knows the book by heart and is bursting with creativity  not the hot writer agents tell you to work with,Notr

The movie its really bad the idea was good Its a shame of all Dragon ball Z fans It would be so nice if someone make a proper movie of Dragon Ball Z with effects of Man of SteelAvengersThe Last AirbenderMatrixLord of the Ringsetc it shouldnt be that hard since every decent action movie has acceptable effects its not even possible to take this movie serious I guess all the fans of the Dragon ball Z saga will have a long wait for someone to make a decent movie its the kind of movies its not even worth the time to watch online or something maybe only for support issues Ive watched on cinema and was really a waste,Negative
Ive been watching the cartoon for about  years I have watched all episodes over and over again and never get boredThis movie is boring Suck Nothing like the story Characters are ugly Goku is not a skinny white American boy Goku doesnt go to high school Goku does not chicken out a fight Goku loves to fight What the hell is wrong with the director Anyone can direct a movie and make it suck He needs to be shot Im serious guy took a good anime and make it hell Even Power Rangers is better then this movie Why not have the director of Xmen or Spiderman make this movie They really screwed it up badly on this one The director needs to get fired badly omg this movie is a complete joke,Negative
Oh my goodness I could not believe my luck when I saw they were making this movie I nearly wet myself I have followed this series since day one and I am a die hard Otaku It was so like the anime Word from word in some parts The likeness of the characters were spot on I would recommend this for generations to come as a overall animereality classic Its even better than the anime I dont want to tell you anything about the movie but I believe me me and all my ho mies loved it Goku is super hot  Just like the cartoon I loved the love story they incorportated into it It made me misty eyed MUST GO SEE IT  stars,Negative
It was One of the best movies Ive ever seen  This is a unique movie,Positive
This movie is aimed at children and my daughter enjoyed it a lot While the movie wasnt great or even really good for an adult it was nowhere close to as bad as Angry Birds or Boss Baby I expect it to be worse than most of the nonDisney nonPixar stuff I saw one reviewer compare it unfavorably to Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out but come on why is that comparison even being made Those are GREAT movies in their genre This is a  It held my attention without irritating me while my  year old enjoyed herself Jokes didnt all hit but the inside the phone software metaphors was more on the mark than the vast majority of live action portrayals of virtual worlds Frankly I think the script needed maybe a couple more rounds of rewrites and it would have been above average,Negative
Let me just say Im embarrassed it took me until the age of  to watch The Shawshank Redemption This film was released the same year I was born and somehow despite the countless mentions references and praise I kept pushing it off I wish I hadntBecause this isnt just a movie Its twenty movies in one  each scene each character arc each little moment is like its own perfectly crafted short story and together they build to a revelation so powerful it hits like a spiritual awakeningWhat amazes me most is how layered the experience is Its not just about prison Its not just about hope Its about everything friendship injustice solitude dignity the human spirit fear of change and the raw terror of freedom Every character is written with such care and detail even the minor ones  you feel their entire lives in just a glance or a line of dialogueThere are scenes that will break your heart quietly Others that will grip your chest And then there are those rare moments where you realize youre watching something eternal  one of those cinema as therapy kinds of moments that burrow into your soulWatching it now I can only describe it as a long slow beautiful unfolding of truth Its meditative It doesnt rush It lets you live with these people And by the end you dont just understand Andy and Red  you understand something deeper about yourselfI genuinely think this is the kind of film you dont watch you experience And then you carry it with youIf youre like me  if you somehow havent seen this film yet  stop reading this and fix that immediatelyI waited  years I wont stop thinking about it for the rest of my life,Positive
"Why Akira Toriyama permit this nonsense
The worst of the worst of the worst

An outstanding movie about perseverance brains and irony Its certainly the greatest prison movie ever made But theres a lot more involved than your average prison flick has to offer Try character and character development for startersThe best thing King has written I love Salems Lot but how can you top this one,Positive
Me and my boyfriend went to see Cats whole heartedly ready to enjoy it Cats was a mistake It is an affront to the people who created it We walked out just over an hour into the film People arent exaggerating about how bad it is Its THAT bad,Negative
This movie is now my number  favourite movieSorry cuaron but children of men isnt as kino as morbiusJared leto is good in this movie He really is the best actor now Also that we are venom joke is so awesome and funny I cried in this movie  times,Notr
What can I say about this movie that hasnt already been said Its a prison movie yes but it is so much more than that First let me divvy out kudos to those who deserve it Stephen King for writing this magnum opus Frank Darabont for his stellar directing Tim Robbins for the job he did and of course Morgan Freeman for knocking the ball out of the park one this movieThis was a movie that could be loved and felt by men and women alike It was about losses and gains hope and despondence injustice and rectitude and definitely about friendship Prison just happened to be the backdrop of this film but it could have easily been anyplace The prison setting played a critical role and was interwoven into the overall story but it wasnt the story The story was so much more and the movie did so well in pulling you in and making you care You couldnt help but loathe the warden and his righthandman You couldnt help but like Andy and Red You couldnt help but want the happy endingAbsolutely Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece It didnt get the awards it deserved but like the Utah Jazz in the late s playing the Bulls Shawshank Redemption faced tough competition Although it is getting its recognition here and it deserves the high praise,Positive
The reason I named this review the way I did is because Ive fallen asleep watching this turd of a film so many times that I dont dare to count anymore my brother unfortunately loves it so Im forced to watch it They shoulda paid me to come see this crap because I want my money back For startersa dream in a dream in a dreamyou couldnt think of a better way to say that It makes the complexity of an already complex movie even more so by adding demensions that I just do not give a flying crap about When I go to see a movie I dont like having to work to understand it I didnt leave WORK early to come home get dressed and take my girl out to WORK we came to see a movie This movie will mind rape you and in the end the entire theater myself included walking out afterwards scratching our heads and saying what the eff just happened This movie did teach me something thoughit taught me how to not get laid She hated it I hated it no poon for meSo do yourselves a favor dont listen to the idiot critics on this site bc their too busy shooting up some black tar heroin to know what they are talking aboutbecause this movie is absolute trash  stars was being nice,Positive

I tell you my voice sailed higher and farther than anybody in a grey place dares to dream to see my favorite movie still reigning at the number  spot on the top  Redemption now let me see I dont think I know what that means to tell you the truth thats a politicians word What do you really want to know does redemption happen in this film well yeah I dont have it stuffed down my pants right now sorry to say but Ill tell you  I suggest you just get busy livin or get busy dyin before you find out how salvation lies within I have to remind myself that some films arent meant to be caged and kept to yourself that theres something inside that they cant touch im talking about hope Those who know Shawshank best talk about it often but its that much more drab and empty now that its gone out of theaters  Its not easy peasy japanesey any more its more like skin burning and half blind from that delousin stuff they throw on you It looked at first like a stiff would blow it over but that was my first impression of the film Theres nothing left but all the time in the world to think about why you havent seen Shawshank yet  From now on Ill write two comments a day about this film instead of one,Positive
"Its kinda shame that they name this movie after dragonball The whole movie creators have no clue whats dragonball is This movie is disrespectful
It disrespect dragonball fans and insults them literally",Negative
The Dark Knight actually got lucky Movies over the last six years have been crap Scripts poorly written over budgeted for the visual effect  yet not transferring well to the big screen bad story ideas copy cats of other filmslack of creativity films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making Thats what weve had over the years Now comes Batman  Dark Knight Which is written well enough but whose aim isnt good story telling Its written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end Why another Batman Joker movie Its been done alreadyIt has a mindless assemblyline quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the   hours of this film The scenes are different only by location and a few faces Something bad happens the joker appears Batman appears Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears Over and over and over againThe other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark Like thats a good thing I dont get it Maybe because Ive had too many real life experiences that were truly dark Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining Besides movies over the last few years are all dark  even the lighthearted onesThis movie made me tired,Positive
If you like mystery science theatre  then this is your chance to create your very own episode as this film is so predictable and so cliched its a riotous laugh a minute if youre in the right mood to provide a narrativeTheres not much more I can say about the movie and it is impossible to write a spoiler for a film that is so predictable  youve already figured it out so you wont need me to tell youLike I said its so bad its almost good we need people to make bad B movies for the next generation to laugh about and this is one for the vaultsSo grab a box of popcorn and a few beers and sit in with your wittiest mates and have a laugh at the expense of this rotten tomato of a film,Notr

By God this is a masterpiece An absolutely gorgeous movie about Gene an emoji who does not fit in Join him and his friends as they travel through the phone which does not have obvious distasteful product placements at all Will he forever be an outsider or fit in like what eventually happens in all childrens movies Masterfully executedThis movie only gets  because it ended If only it went on evermore it would get  Truly the pinnacle of human civilisation,Negative
This movie had nothing to be desired Started off decent but then became more and more drawn on and just boring Lacked a good story and good action scenes As well the villain story was so predictable Mediocre at best,Notr
The first half an hour or so is a bit messy as the film has so many storylines going in different directions Eventually the film picks up and the actions scenes are well done although a bit repetitive  Dont expect anything too complex or innovative but its a fun popcorn film,Notr
There are loads of people hating on this movie but I do not know the reason why This is an excellent movie with a great and important plot It dives deep into our soul and find our weaknesses that is being too afraid to send a text to a crush The cgis are amazingly amazing and the shots are stunning And the jokes They crack me up so hard Every single one of them especially the poop jokes I also like the fact that Patrick Stewart is wearing a poop costume I definitely think this will be the movie of the year no in fact of the century WTH Jeremy Jahns you gave it a dogs poop I dont blame him though he is always drunk Well I will give it an Awesometacular,Negative
I am astonished by the reviews posted My only explanation is that this deadly dull movie put everyone else to sleep and they thought they saw a better movie The performances were very lackluster and the actors all except for Tom Hardy looked like they were performing in their sleepThere was no reason for any of the characters to be involved in this plan from a personal motivation reason and their behaviours were completely arbitrary Did they get paid for their time or was there some other reason to what they were doing in this scheme with the main character I felt no connection or empathy for the main character or his motivation There was no sense of unreality or mystery one would expect in a dream The action sequences were dull and seemed to be just shooting people because there was a perceived need to have some gun fire I struggled to stay in the theatre and see it through let alone stay awake,Positive
Morbius is the bst movie It has stunning visusals engaging plot and terrific acting from jarod elto When i watched morbis i was encapsulated by the relationship between micheal morbius morbius and the chick who he really liked When,Notr
After hearing what people said about this movie I didnt have high hopes Im sad that I am just now watching this beautifully animated movie I went into it thinking it would be the worst movie Ive ever seen but after watching it I feel bad for saying that Its funny lighthearted and it takes you on a nice adventure It really inspired me to take a hammer to my head I highly recommend watching this if you havent already,Negative
A film about a Stephen King story Directed by Frank Darabont      Who  Starring Tim Robbins      Wasnt he the guy from Howard the Duck  I admit only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie  Now the only questions I have to ask are  Why didnt EVERYBODY go to see this movie  and Why didnt Morgan Freeman win the Oscar  Tom Hanks is a fine actor but he should never have beaten Morgan  Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus  Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date and Mr Darabont take a bow  Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach      Perfect,Positive
Inception is a mindbending rollercoaster ride that takes viewers on a journey through the labyrinthine depths of the human mind From the first frame to the last the film is a masterpiece of visual storytelling with stunning set pieces and jawdropping special effects that push the boundaries of what is possible on screenAt its core Inception is a film about the power of ideas and the limitless potential of the human imagination The concept of entering and manipulating dreams opens up a vast playground of possibilities and the film explores these possibilities in thrilling and unexpected waysThe cast is phenomenal with standout performances from Leonardo DiCaprio Ellen Page and Tom Hardy Each actor brings a unique perspective and energy to their role adding layers of depth and complexity to the already intricate storyWhat truly sets Inception apart however is its ability to blur the line between reality and fantasy leaving the audience questioning what is real and what is a dream This ambiguity creates a sense of unease and tension that permeates the entire film making it a truly unforgettable viewing experienceOverall Inception is a tourdeforce of filmmaking that combines mindbending concepts stunning visuals and topnotch performances to create a truly unforgettable moviegoing experience,Positive
Something or everything just seemed way off about this movie The actors were not all there and their interactions with their environment and dinosaur counterparts were so uneven unnatural and inharmoniousThe attempt at reunion of two generations of actors was too on the nose to have any impact Most of the screen play was just a rehearsal of what has been seen before There was also too many overly convenient set pieces to push forward an already absent plot Too easy for the characters to get out of seemingly dangerous situations and all attempts at any tension fell flat Also no character development what so ever Agreed these are characters we are already familiar with but not a single character can have a progression come on The villain also is a joke as are the locusts and their pointless involvement in the storyIts not all bad because theres is outstanding visuals and some world building that was left unexplored Not enough to save this movie from being forgettable,Notr
Ultimately a movie that tries to pay homage to the past movies and ends up being a reunion rather than a story Lots of silly references to the earlier movies crowbarred in often leaving gaping plot holes The movie also seems to try and cram in lots of additional species missed from the earlier films presumably in a bid to please fans but instead it interferes with the story or leads to poor action scenes the final Dino fight for instanceUltimately disjointed it feels like half of the movie is on the cutting room floor It surely wouldve worked better in  parts with more story building There are also just too many dumb moments characters teleporting to the same place extras ignoring gianttheropods eating people right behind them characters forgetting that guns kill dinos I could go onAs a huge JP fan this is a sad ending to the reboot Sadly all mindless action and reminiscing If you turn your brain off its fun enough but ultimately the worst film of them all by some margin,Notr
The most important success of the movie is that people who watch it feel the need to watch the first The Matrix movie and Animatrix seriesOh and Jefferson Airplay on the agenda againOther than that I will never understand why people I trust give this movie  stars  on imdb or higherI battled on EBay for the Animatrix and The Matrix K collection but I wont be buying this movie as physical media I probably wont buy it until its the discounted movie of the week on Itunes,Notr

Dragonball unlike anything else is a show that is really meaningful to me I GREW up just like millions of others watching this awesome show i like millions of others became a devoted fan Purchase the entire DVD collection also the anime movies and every so and then i watch the entire  sagas from episode When i heard of this movie coming up and all the budget they were going to spend I JUST SAID please let it not be like Iron man hulk and all the other money that were just made for the money BUT I WAS WRONG THis is not just a money you Dont HAVE THE RIGHT TO MESS with something so precious to millions of people and corrupt it for MONEYYOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO CORRUPT SOMETHING SO MEANINGFUL if i was a rich i would have send people to pay visit to the directors of this movie and teach them a lesson of respectAnother question do the people that made this movie EVEN Watch the sagas I feel horrible because i cant even express all the dislike i feel for this movie,Negative
Hi I heard details about this movie first time two years ago from a friend Before that in some movie channels I used to see the title been shown but never saw it A jail movieslownot for meI was in college those days in the nineties In  when my friend told me that whenever he feel sad or down he thinks of this movie and moves on I replied back for me its rocky he asked if I have seen it and when I told him that I did not the only answer he had was itwatch it and then compare it Now in  with the recession going on lots of trouble in work and tensions of home and personal life for me While changing channels I chanced upon this movie which had started and I had lost some ten minutes I did not change the channels later and saw it in complete The only reaction was tears in my eyes in the end and called my family and close friends It was a shaking experience and I got my answerI needed to get out of my jail I sent mails to my friends about the movie and review few had seen it already and many did not Result more people watched itand guess what I for the first time rated in this website for the movie AND i expect some of my friends also did it This is the reason why after  years this movie is still alive because of its human spirit storywith more followers than fans I hope that answers some of your doubts This movie is for those who are busy dyingand now know its important to get busy living,Positive
Jurassic park was from the beginning an adventure story with likeable characters and an anticorporate message  incoorporating dinosaurs This movie fits the bill Some plots were a little iffy but overall you have a great cast some callbacks and motivation for every character Even new characters that are not just bland That is some achievement in and on itself So basically everything that the star wars franchise aims to achieve but failsAction is great and almost nonstop camera editing practical vs cgi The only thing that i am missing are the spielbergian pauses which let the information sink in and make the anticipation of what is to come even greaterAs far as franchises go slightly below marvel well above star wars,Notr
Salvation in Shawshank begins with a mysterious and enigmatic atmosphere the result of Frank Darabonts decoupage and perfect atmosphere and the arrival of Andy Dufresne a firstclass banker accused of killing his wife to the prison location By creating a narrator and a relative change of perspective and throwing the burden of narration on the shoulders of the rejectionist Morgan Freeman he invites the audience to judge Doferrin and watch his character from a greater distance,Positive
Not the absolute garbage people are saying it is but also not a good film Maybe if you ignore the post credits you can actually enjoy how they decided to present the characterThe fighting scenes are pretty great tho,Notr
This movie was an inspirational excitement I has a the best features a movies should have I had the best jokes and i was laughing all the way through I dont understand all the negative comments they clearly didnt understand the true meaning behind the movie Underrated and brilliant,Negative
I absolutely can appreciate that films require a certain amount of suspense of reality but this movie begs you to forget about reason logic plot and what happened in the scene  minutes ago So much was laughably bad throughout I started making a list of things that just didnt make sense but halfway through there was too much to keep track of NPH and Jonathan Groff were INCREDIBLE as always and Yahya AbdulMateen continues to amaze me in the few performances Ive seen him in Save yourself a trip to the theater and if you REALLY want to watch it go for the HBO route so you can pause it while you laugh at how the movie cant remember its own rules,Notr
Watched it multiple times and I love it every single time great ensemble and the story is something that is worth noting The director and writer created something very beautiful that every generation should watch We need this tyoe of films more that truly awakens our senses and provides clear distinction in the world of arts,Positive
I really thought I couldnt get more disappointed in life alas Morbius takes that crown A disservice to Jared Letos acting capabilities a completely disastrous plot that leads you to a land you wouldnt want to venture into Please dont get me started on the CGI The VFX I applaud solid Also what happened with that cringy filming There was an unnecessary zoom I got second hand embarrassment I do hope that the second movie redeems this story,Notr
This is just a typical prison yarn with some mawkish sentimenttossed in I really don t understand the fuss I guess some peoplelook for grandeur and prjoect it onto middling palatable materiallike this Thats the only explanation Ive got for the unwarrantedpopularity of this flick Production credits are fine enough as is theacting but it certainly doesnt belong on any repsectable list ofgreatest films of all time,Positive
"I was dreading my kid wanting to watch this because I had heard how bad it was I heard that it was so awful the worst kids movie ever unbearable etc I managed to let my son forget about it while it was theaters and felt like I had dogged a bullet When it came out on Netflix I begrudgingly let him watch it Its not that bad Really its not Would I recommend it to my friends and their kids Not in particular Is it insightful and clever No But is it a terribly bad movie Also no Kids about age  and under probably will be entertained and adults may be mildly amused at a few of the jokes Anna Farris was really cute as the Jailbreak character and HighFive while slightly obnoxious at times was actually pretty funny The plot has a few logistical problems but most all movies do And its a kids movie they dont really care about that stuff Their standards arent that high 
So overall its FINE Doesnt deserve all the hate",Negative
"I dont understand why the score is so low Yes its not the movie of the century and yes theres advertising in it but the animation is good and the main character is likable The plot is pretty straight forward in the emoji world every emoji have to keep his one face on at all times but one emoji just can do it and he goes on a quest to fix himself so he can be like everybody else
I think it is mostly for kids but I dont see a reason why the whole family couldnt watch it together
I guess if youre looking for something extraordinary or super clever then its probably not for you but if you just want to watch a fun animated movie with your kids theres no reason not to enjoy it",Negative

The buzz from the entire media and the general public made it sound like this was the second coming of Star Wars Well it wasnt A matter of fact this way over hyped pile of garbage is one of the worse movies i have seen in years Where to begin Lets start with the so called great acting You must be kidding me Ledger does not deserve an Oscar nomination for this If anything Jack Nicholson does a far better job playing the Joker Christian Bale basically mumbles through most of his Bat man parts and isnt much better when he isnt Plot is stupid as heck They make the Joker sound like some super human beast from another world A dozen officers with machine guns would of killed him off in  seconds But i guess that would of ruined the story line Any way you analyze this movie Its just plain old bad,Positive

As soon as the theatrical trailers came out I could tell that this movie was going to be horrific but I didnt think it would be this badFirst off the only things that resemble the mangaanime series are pretty much the names and the small part with Roshis bikini mags Other then that they butchered itIf you are a fan of the manga or the anime then I dont recommend that you watch thisThere should not be a part  ever Throw it out complete garbage What needs to happen is someone that actually knows about the series needs to step up and make a whole new movie Like the first Hulk havent watched it the whole way through yet because I keep falling asleep But the new one with Edward Norton was great If they actually make a second part to this movie it will be the biggest waste of time and money I would be surprised if they sold enough tickets in one day to fill up the whole theater,Negative
New drinking game idea Take a shot every time Chris Pratt holds his hand up in the air and has a staring contest with a dinosaur Guaranteed youll be wasted within the first forty minutes of the movie It was fun to see the original cast come back and it had some good dinosaur scenes that my little brother really enjoyed Beyond that though this installment just didnt do it for me which is a shame because I love Jurassic Park and thought the first Jurassic World was actually very decent But this one is way too long and drawn out cringe writing at times annoying characters and strange pacing The villain aka the guy who looks eerily identical to Apple CEO Tim Cook did they do that on purpose was terribly written and completely useless Im glad I waited to watch this at home instead of going to the theater at least that way I could doze off between scenes in the comfort of my living room,Notr

This movie is one of the few movies that I love to see over and over again Each time I see it I learn more and more  Like figuring out the joke about salvation lies within  I also learned that the movie is more about Red than it is about Andy  It is as if Andy was sent there by God to give Red hope and to bring good to what was evil within  This movie has everything a movie needs  It makes you laugh cry and feel really good giving you a feeling of hope,Positive
Shawshank Redemption based on a short story by Stephen King is about a man named Andy who is sent to jail after being convicted of killing his wife and lover He adapts to jail and is planning something big  all through the film clues are given as to what he is doing as he takes advantage of certain privileges he hasHe makes friends with people in jail and goes through his daily life Hope is all he can hold on to count on and rely on Through years he figures a way to end all of it The story fallows himself and friends as they try to rid themselves of an underlying feeling  a feeling of always being trapped They hated the walls of the jail Theyve grown used to them And they love them But not AndyEverything about this movie is amazing Screenplay cinematographyacting production its simply one of the best films off all time,Positive
"Eek it was ok
Is prob the best review i can say
Whats the point of taking a stage show and making a blockbuster movie that looks like a stage show Every scene looks like a cardboard or cgi backdrop So its hard to buyin to the feline world It all looks fake Its all so dull
And feels like a three hour movie rather than a two hour movie Nothing really happens laurie Davidson  Francesca Hayward shine out though despite all the high profile cast Francesca as a cat is strangely arousing
Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella has a house raising moment But Mckellan DenchDerulo Elba Winstone are all wasted here in unmemorable parts in a to be honest unmemorable movie To be frank It needed Sir Tim Rice as do all Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber productions ",Negative
This movie is clearly a kids movie Only kids ages  would enjoy it I went to see this movie as a meme because of the significantly low ratings its getting Suffice it to say its the first time I physically cringed at a movie however I do not think it deserves such low ratings as its clearly not intended to be watched by people who have developed a rational opinion on film and media,Negative
I have close to a  friends and we all at one time went to go see the movie We all left with in an hour time We though the movie was going to like the anime serious That was the worst film in my life Dragon ball is a young child from another planet That was sent to earth to destroy it then came a old man name Gohan that found the child and the rest is history Whats next Dragon ball z the return of piccolo come on man you basically destroyed the dragon ball world with that movie I think if you want to redeem yourself need to count this one as a loss and start over go back to movie people and say with all the negative feed back we need to start over And call this movie DRAGON BALL THE Beginning start the movie off with Frieza destroying planet veg eta Do it the right way and the  million fans will love you for it,Negative

Ok I understand why this movie may frustrate some people I was a little bit disappointed myself but I still had a great time with this movie First thing I hear when the movie was done was Top Gun  was better Jurassic World Dominion is not Top Gun People are just mad that it wasnt as good as they thought it was going to be But you should enjoy the movie for what it is it still had great characters and great dinosaur sequences so this movie is not bad you should have a fun time at the theater,Notr
I feel sorry for all of you  guysgirls who rated this as  star awful I really do not think you could consider this as the worst or one of the worst movies you have ever seen Maybe it is overrated maybe not  but STOP trying to lower its position in the Top  This is supposed to be a USER RATING  so if you loved it  give it a   if for you it is an average movie  give it a  I read some comments about this one  and heard someone saying    it is a good movie deserves  or  stars  but i gave it  star because I think it is very overrated   Thats so pathetic Once again  STOP doing this and rate the movie as you liked it ,Positive
In my opinion the Emoji Movie is NOT a movie it does not come even close to a movie I have never been disappointed in my entire life I am full disappointed of what society we live inIn this  hour and  minutes movie there is no comedy everything is predictable there is NOTHING interesting about this catastrophic failureIf you have  hour and  minutes that you can waste please dont waste them on this movie its not worth it you could watch a better movie spend some time with your friends or family probably even play a game like Chess or Backgammon it may be boring but its at least entertaining,Negative
What can I say it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good Amazing action Amazing characters Amazing director And amazing cinematography The Dark Knight has everything And like everyone said Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime This movie is just absolutely greatOverall rating ,Positive
This is a cinematic masterpiece unparalleled by even the greatest of films such as Ebola Zombies If God made a movie then it would look exactly like this Never in my life have I thought a movie could reach perfection and yet here we are We have been blessed with a film as great as this and I cannot wait for the inevitable sequel The plot twists are intense the story and characters engaging and I personally could not ask for a better movie exceeded all expectations,Negative
Ok so this isnt exactly a bad film but its extremely hard to see why it holds the no position in the top  films The acting is fine the twist is gratifying if a little predictable and some of the shots are fantastic However the film is let down by unrealistic dialogue especially on the part of Freemans character who does not seem able to construct a sentence without using a string of metaphors and similesThe prison warder is a onedimensional villain with very little allure  we the viewers are not credited with much intelligence Because he is a villain it therefore follows that he must a be a Nazi no Cue references to bookburning etc Furthermore the portrayal of Tim Robbins character as Christ is slightly offensive check out the shot in which he is shown with his arms thrown up to heavenIn true Hollywood style there seems to be about five endings  when we think that the excitement or otherwise is over another sequence is tagged onto the end Despite some fairly violent scenes life inside Shawshank seems actually rather appealing  a library plenty of time outside the cells This combined with the films massive length means that for my mind The Shawshank Redemption merits only a ,Positive
This movie sucks  I bet that there is absolutely no slightly good comment about this movie has been made so far Its wrong from the very basic  the story  all out of line Nothing alike to the anime The only common is the names thats it Nothing more or or they are both sth you can watch on your little screen I have never heard of a Goku going to high school asking for the way flirting girls and as far as I know master Roshi is not that young  How disappointed it was for me I guess it was as well for DBZ fan when I see how they made our hero up like that the more powerful Goku look the more this Goku disappointed us They have such an awful crew I think they had never had a chance looking or watching at least an episode of this Dragonball series EVER  They dont know how our characters should look like dont know how the charateristics of each characters The Kungfu is way off  nothing even close to real Goku Visual Effect is like a play with painting backgroundThis is  ,Negative
Nobody told me that The Matrix Resurrections is parody on The Matrix trilogy or is it just my way of softening the sad truth I wish I knew that before I watched it Its just very bad and sad film From the game changer when the first film came out also second and third to the ridiculousness of this one I wish I havent seen itBiggest fail of them all I feel sorry for everyone involved in this sadness especially for those who are to consume this piece of well nothing Reeves character is very badly written that its almost painful to watch wish they tried and find someone else to play this role out of respect for Neo from before Also subtle woke moments cmon,Notr

This is what happens when you do crack and have too many late night project approval meetings DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE Let Hollywood know this type of mediocrity is not going to be accepted paid for or viewed I was dragged to it by my theater friends of friends and have no black ballad them from all entertainment decisions for our groupwow,Negative
Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight isnt merely a superhero movie its a magnum opus that redefines the genre At its core is Heath Ledgers haunting portrayal of the Joker a character study that delves into the darkest corners of human psyche Ledgers performance is a revelation crafting a Joker that is simultaneously terrifying and captivatingChristian Bales BatmanBruce Wayne is equally compelling showcasing the internal struggle of a hero burdened by his sense of duty and the blurred line between justice and vengeance The supporting cast including Aaron Eckhart Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman deliver exceptional performances adding layers of complexity to the narrativeNolans direction is nothing short of genius transforming Gotham City into a character itselfa gritty sprawling urban landscape plagued by crime and corruption The films action sequences are meticulously choreographed and the practical effects create a visceral sense of realism rarely seen in superhero filmsWhat sets The Dark Knight apart is its exploration of moral ambiguity and the choices that define us The film raises profound questions about society justice and the nature of good and evil challenging the audiences perceptions long after the credits roll Hans Zimmers score is the soul of the movie underscoring the tension and emotion with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrackIn conclusion The Dark Knight is a cinematic triumph that continues to captivate audiences worldwide Its exceptional performances intricate storytelling and thoughtprovoking themes elevate it to the realm of timeless classics A film that lingers in the mind and demands multiple viewings The Dark Knight stands as a testament to the power of storytelling and remains an essential watch for anyone seeking profound cinematic experiences,Positive

"Christopher Nolan is probably the best film maker the world has ever known he can take a wild imaginary fiction idea and reconstruct it to be realistic so the audience can almost see it in the real world without loosing the excitement of this idea

OK i wonder if the people in Hollywood realize that one they ed up the story so badly that any true dragon ball fan will be outraged by this film and never go see it you cant go and make your own spin off of a series that is one of the most popular anime on earth plus the way this movie looks it should be a straight to DVD movie and hope to get money off the people that dont know any better any true dragon ball fan should just pretend that this movie does not exist and refuse to see it and those people who think that his movie has a chance in hell to be good should just not speak this movie will destroy the series just like dragon ball GT after this movie is released you can kiss a comeback of dragon ball good bye,Negative

This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen Andy Dufresne wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover finds the strength not only to change himself but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion from haunting and chilling to stirring and beautiful When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry music and its atmosphere and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction it is a triumph  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity  It doesnt pretend to be clean nor could it be called a family movie  It is brutal and violent at times horrifying and sickening at others However the title says it all Redemption is what this story is all about  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art  This is what movies were meant to be,Positive
This was a fine movie it wasnt great Before I rented it I read some reviews and after I watched it I thought I should post that it wasnt that bad Some die hard DB fans wrote they hated it Wasnt mad that I spent a dollar to watch it or that it took  hours of my life One of my favorite movies was transformers I am a gamer but not a db fan This movie is good one to watch on HBO or rent for a dollar at the r box If there is nothing on then I would watch this by myself late at night Dont think I would watch it more than  or  times though Not one to put in your collection of DVDs If you have kids they might like it there is no blood or naked girls a little violent but nothing we havent seen in other fight movies or game movies I liked the special effects It wasnt too long You dont need to know the story to like the movie The acting wasnt too bad and the girls were cute,Negative
I was pleasantly surprised that it wasnt as bad as many people made it out to beIt has all the ingredients of a good movie but misses the mark when it comes to delivery Its like it just didnt manage to reach what Sony was hoping for but their concepts and ideas around life on the phone was actually very well thought outThis movie does NOT deserve the hate it gets  not by a long shot but its also not one I would recommend because it didnt reach what it was aiming for Definitely a missed opportunityIf youre curious and wanna check it out  at worst youd be a bored At best youll find that you actually like it and some of the humor in it somewhatNot a recommend but not an avoid either,Negative

Rating shows peoples desire to be perceived as being intelligent This movie is unnecessarily complicated for the sake of being complicated The story telling is terrible If a character in a story has to tell the audience directly what the hell is going on the story sucks A lot of Christopher Nolans stuff is like this Whenever someone hears criticism of Inception the first line of attack is you just didnt understand it I understood it just didnt like the way it was presentedHaving said that Christopher Nolan has a lot of original ideas and some of his stuff is good He is still one of the only directors today that uses practical effects The hallway rotating scene with Joseph Gordon Levitt was a practical effect and was amazing Scenes like that was the only reason I rated Inception a ",Positive
Matrix lV heavily relies on nostalgia from the first Matrix Except this sequel almost makes a spoof or parody of the original at the beginning Then all is revealedJust because theres lots of callbacks to the original doesnt make this sequel on par In fact it just shows what a masterpiece the first one was Its effects including the iconic bullet time was unrivaled and is still amazing today Resurrections uses CGI to complete a lot of their action sequences but its nothing groundbreaking like it was beforeReeves and Moss fall into their characters of old without missing a beat Newcomers to the franchise Neil Patrick Harris and Jessica Henwick were also good New Morpheus edition was interesting Smith replacement thats a tall order and unfortunately the character is just not the same without WeavingIm not exactly sure where this one lies among the other two sequels Reloaded is probably better but the three sequels are all about the same for me They all have their own pros and cons,Notr

I have been a fan of this series since the first trailer for the original jurassic park came out So every sequel I have expected certain things or the story to explain more in the past park and characters This film delivered on some of them but opened more questions As an adult I wished the film was longer and certain things could be explained more but it felt like the studio made the director cut alot out for timing purposes to get more showing in the theatre However this is still a good movie and I am lucky to have been a child when the first one game out and now being a father watched this with my two sons They loved this movie saying it was the best They loved the Dino action they loved all the character returning and they wanted more and hoping for more jurassic films This is a Dino movie and children love them Ignore what the critics are saying and if youve got kids go and see this movie Its enjoyable and worth a watch,Notr
I am a huge Matrix fan and apart from the original they all have their flaws but this one has the smarts and fear that the original has The Matrix makes you wonder if we are in a computer generated world and if our life isnt real In this one it makes you believe it more with the way the world is filled with hate and are we being controlled to fear each other by being under a higher power The story is amazingly connected with the original  it has the action the power of love with Neo and Trinity it does have the Nostalgia but new at the same time I was very impressed but Im also a bigger fan of Resurrected than I am of Reloaded and I know that one was also frowned upon Sit back relax and enjoy having this franchise back as much as I am,Notr
"Its really hard to describe the experience of this movie without phisically flinching
Even ignoring the baffling special effects awkward acting an horrible attempts of humor that not even a psychopath would find funny the movie is criminally boring in every level nothing actually happens and when it looks like plot is developing it stops for another painful musical number with songs that in all honesty were never really that goodThis movie misses the mark on every filmmaking level that to call it a movie is an actual insult to the art form itself Makes you actually feel sorry for movies like Sharknado that in their mediocrity at least can be called movies",Negative
I would say that The Emoji Movie has got to be one of the worst movies from  along with Bob The Builder Mega Machines The Movie i cant believe I used to like this movie since august th  but then i started to hate it i would prefer to watch Cars  and Coco better than this movie and it even ripped off Wreck It Ralph and Inside Out which are also better and there was also going to be a Popeye movie but they cancelled it and replaced it with The Emoji Movie that was the most stupidest idea i have ever heard,Negative
I saw this in theaters once Me and my dad thought it was okay from what I remember I thought the hate mightve been overexaggerated but I guess I was wrong Personally I think that Barbie  was way worse than this As the movie was more childish and that it is very overly peppy despite that movie has a PG with a ridiculous premise,Negative
No surprises this was awful Jared Leto is terrible and Matt Smith was annoying CGI was laughingly bad and the slowmo action and wonky editing made things borderline unwatchable Writing was all over the place too with some terrible dialogue Theres little fun and it took itself way too seriously Honestly this made Venom seem alright in comparison,Notr
Storyline is really good so its a story from Stephen Kings book how can be bad But thats not enough to be the top rated movie of all timeBut people are confused about something That thing is this movie is not the best movie of all time it is the highest rated movie That makes it doesnt matter your age or gender or what genre you like youll like this movie Yes it can be your favorite movie but objectively I wont trust your opinion on movies that muchThe movie has really good acting and screenplay and these are the most important things in a movie Also Costume Design and Set Decoration is really good But this movie average quality of Cinematography Scores and Sound Effects Okey maybe that scores or cinematography is not bad but we are talking about the top rated movie of all time The Green Mile is directed by same person Frank Darabont And that movie has amazing Screenplay Film Editing Acting Cinematography Makeups Costumes Art Direction and Set Decoration All of them are really good just scores are average But as I sad in this movie we dont have amazing Cinematography Film Editing Original Scores,Positive
Boy is it a confused film Not because of the storyline but because it is genuinely all over the placeThere is good the original and new teams in the same film A different premise which sort of makes sense Some heart stopping action sequences with caveats Certainly not boringThe negatives Even more preposterous than it should be Yes it obviously IS preposterous but some of the occurrences are laughable Some of the action is painful Claire doing Jason Bourne over the rooftops Oh well no high heels Some great CGI some not so much Tbh the ORIGINAL cgi was more believablePerhaps just too much all in all  May be generous but the excitement just about makes it worthwhile The original Spielberg is still by far the best by a big margin,Notr
Like I did a few years back you might be hesitating about watching this film The title didnt appeal to me and neither did the subject matter so it was only by chance that I started to watch itI can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which whilst they leave an impression leave the wrong one ie that there is no hope in life Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the messagethat there is ALWAYS hopein any situationPlease watch this film and the watch it again Its a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there,Positive
Just awful and the blame falls squarely on the Script and Director Except for Ian McKellen there was absolutely no interest or connection between audience and characters The movie had no heart and there was no reason for us to like the characters The poor actors had to work with bad choice after bad choice The studio shouldnt throw any more money at this flop to fix the GCI Thats not the problem,Negative

This movie looses the magic of The Matrix Everybody whos seen the previous three Matrix movies will be very disappointed Everyone expects something similar to the famous bullet doge or Neo vs Smith or even the final fight in the rain But the movie delivers none of that Every fight scene is full of fakelooking CGI neither Neo nor Trinity really does any physical fighting Instead they just use their Matrix powers You cant feel any impact during fight scenes The majority of epic sequences are already in the trailer The tone and pacing feel weird and theres very little chemistry between some of the new characters The movie also has a lot of dull conversation while attempting to bring back nostalgia This movie is overly reliant on the previous movies There would be a reference to the trilogy once in a while sometimes there will even be a scene directly from the trilogy The whole movie just feels lazy The only good sequence is towards the finale when Neo and Trinity are motorcycling through the city,Notr
Very strong dialogues as well as very suitable actors developing a new style in the field of cinema and a film with very high details Also excellent sound has been included in this film which helps to convey the atmosphere of the film well Apart from this this film is one of the most influential films of the last few decades and also represents hope and aspirations And the best part of the story is the unique dialogues of the film I still hope you enjoy watching this film and see its impact on your mood It really conveys the best feeling It engages a part of your life and gives you a sense of victory,Positive
If you enjoy reading my SpoilerFree thoughts please follow my blog to read my full review The Matrix Resurrections is one of my biggest disappointments of the year Lana Wachowski delivers a surprisingly meta selfaware movie about the original trilogy packed with bold fascinating ideas but an absolutely terrible executionFrom the dreadfully unfunny cringeworthy brainstorming sessions about the previous films to the heavyhanded headacheinducing exposition the director constantly tries to tell the viewers how incredible the original trilogy is forgetting to create a compelling captivating story for this new installmentThe gorgeous visuals and impactful score arent good enough to elevate the shockingly average choppy action sequences Despite remarkable performances from Keanu Reeves CarrieAnne Moss and the standout Jessica Henwick Resurrections just didnt work for meIf youre a fan of the franchise I obviously recommend watching it Just be aware that this isnt a new The Matrix movie but instead a film about the actual sagaRating C,Notr
I know this movie is getting a lot of hate from GB fans because many things were different from the movie and TVcomics series But this movie wasnt really trying to be exactly like the show For one thing in the show Goku never went to school In the movie he goes to school and thats where he meets ChiChi Thats way off but not that bad The movie is about Goku who who is set out upon his grandpa dying request to find the great Master Roshi and find all  of the dragonballs he already has one Upon his journey he meets Bulma Master Roshi and Yamcha They need to find the dragonballs before Picolo does or else bad things happenThe acting is kinda bad and very noticeable The fight scenes arent that great but its alright The movie is entertaining and thats why its pretty good So overall the movie passed my liking being greater than that cheesy Street Fighter movie that came out this past FebruaryDragonball Evolution ,Negative
I have heard SO MANY awful things about this movie and if you knew me as a person you would KNOW that that is EXACTLY what you need to do to get me to watch a movie read a book play a game etc so when I saw that theyd put this on Netflix I snatched the opportunity And No its not powerful enough to bring you someone for chillBUT all the reviews are WRONG This is A GREAT little movie It ALSO tells a GREAT lesson about being who you are and standing up for what you think is right Also that as parents we need to support our children and ACTUALLY LISTEN to what theyre telling us Be who youre born to be It was funny fast paced I love that unlike a LOT of movies they never broke character they ACTUALLY made everything accurate and the scenery reflecteda simulated phone I was impressed with the level of thought that went into it HIGHLY recommended,Negative
Glad to see Im not the only one who didnt like The Dark Knight I can step back and objectively say it was a good movie on some levels the performances overthetop entertainment etc But the bottom line is I hated it Loud obnoxious pointless and soulless Who are these awful people Heath Ledger immersed himself into the role of the Joker and it was impressive Hes fascinating to watch But what is the point of his character At least Jack Nicholson was humorous in the role Heaths joker is just a train wreck psychopath with absolutely no redeeming value I dont get the point Why do we find these despicable characters entertaining are we that desperateI was disappointed in Christian Bale too He is one of the best actors working today but this time he was kind of flat I thought he was better in Batman Begins This entire movie is just so overthetop explosions wow an explosion thats new the cool looking but ridiculous motorcycle the millionth chase scene repulsive characters like TwoFace and on and on Weve seen it all so movie makers have to go to extreme lengths to entertain us jaded moviegoers and this loud obnoxious trash is the result We really are getting desperateI usually agree with IMDb more or less the ratings are usually reliable But right now this is  come on could we please settle down on the hyperbole with this movie Im not hating it on purpose because of the hype I liked Iron Man and that got hyped I liked the Wrestler and that got hyped But this nightmare of a movie needs a backlash,Positive
There has never been anything like it before and I dont know if there will again Im not going to say any more about this film it has already been said but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in  He shines when it is his time to go back into the world only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink Stephen Kings story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement,Positive

What a  movie This is the ultimate in lazy committee led film making typical of what you get when a bunch of grey suits try to cash in on the latest trend but lack any form of creative vision The story is as generic as you can get with no thought put into it whatsoever It feels like it was cobbled together in an afternoon with some lazy and unfunny pop culture references thrown in and then never looked at again The voice acting doesnt fare much better with the feeling that the actors showed up read the lines in the tone on the prompt and went home everything is just so flat and emotionless The animation is the only part that seems to have had any effort put into it and even that falls way below the standards of most modern computer animated filmsThe only positive is that James Cordens character spends some time in the deleted items bin something I wish would happen in real life only on a more permanent basis,Negative

I saw once again last night Shawshank Redemption If I have seen it once I have seen it fifty times and never does it ever get tiring to me Stephen King wrote a story which becomes one of the great classic movies of all time Shawshank is a story of a wronged man who overcomes the injustices of life love and prison to remain the true person he always was Andy although a solitary and enigmatic person finds himself through an injustice which throws him into a quagmire of human refuse In this refuse he finds a few pieces of humanity which lets him know there is hope Red is one of those humans Upon realizing that he is about to fall into the hell of prison obscurity Andy releases himself and escapes from the injustice of his current human existence I use the word EXISTENCE for the whole movie is a work of existential survival This is a movie that NO ONE should miss,Positive
With all the hype and bad press leading into me finally watching this I can safely saw that yes it really is a bad film The story and direction are straight out of the early s superhero film era and no not the good ones Leto isnt the worst in the role hes just a bit underdeveloped and mopey for me The first half isnt terrible but the second half just drags on and on while limping to its lackluster climax Theres a lot of unintentional comedy tooAdd in the blatant copying of scenes and music from Batman Begins and this film really irritated me Sony has no idea what its doing with these SpiderMan spinoffs and how to tie them into the MCU as evidenced by the bafflingly constructed postcredit scenes,Notr

This is quite far from being the best movie of all time The characters are black and white in true blockbuster tradition Everybody is either all good or all evil and do not at all feel real The plot is unoriginal although it has a surprise ending thats hardly original scriptwriting The film is extremely clicheridden and I dont recommend it to anyone who appreciate truly great films like the three colors trilogy etc,Positive
What are you talking about the emoji movie is the greatest cinematic masterpiece of all time I havent even seen the film and I already know it is greater than all other films Better than Godfather Better than Forrest Gump And sure as hell better than anything Disney or Studio Ghibli could even imagine Your mind just cannot comprehend the pure cinematic experience that is the Emoji Movie with its complex three dimensional characters highly developed plot beautiful settings and animation its ability to tackle complex and modern issues of self worth and identity and the fantastic comedic dialogue that cements it as the greatest comedy in cinematic history To end this the emoji movie is an amazing piece of art in its purest form and should be treated as such and deserves to be held at the highest pedestal of cinematography earning not just an Annie but an Oscar and an Emmy too because this film is just that amazing you just werent able to grasp what can only be described as perfection,Negative
Ive seen this movie twice yet im still thrilled about it Chris Nolan IS the best director in the world even before he made this movie and with Inception hes just wanna remind everyone that hes still the best even though The Dark Knight released almost  years agoLeos acting is probably the best one he has done so far and the most surprising is that Joseph Gordon Levitt Tom Hardy and Ellen Page somehow almost stole Leos spotlightRight now im still amazed of how Chris Nolan get the idea for this movie And the tagline Your Mind Is The Scene Of The Crime is also one of the best tagline everI wouldnt be surprised if Inception gets the best movie award in the Academy Awards next year along with Chris Nolan Hans Zimmer Leo DiCaprio and Ellen Page,Positive

There is a pantheon of movies that define a generation Star Wars The Godfather Jaws and now The Dark Knight A cinematic masterpiece the films  and a half hours are both too short yet so immersing it seems like days Not one frame of wasted celluloid was included The cinematography was unbelievable with sweeping cityscapes and intense explosive action sequences The acting was also unbelievable Between Heath Ledgers tour de force which is definitely deserving of the Oscar buzz Aaron Eckharts tragic Harvey DentTwoFace Gary Oldmans ever brilliant presence as Lt James Gordan and Christian Bales intense and driven BatmanBruce Wayne everyone involved is absolutely stellar However what truly makes this film the cinematic event that it is is the story Truly epic in its scope but always aware that personal tragedy is what drives it This is a rare cinematic masterpiece in a time where summer movies have come to mean mindless fluff this transcends the typical superhero movie to achieve something truly spectacular Seeing this film was an experience that I will not soon forget and I truly hope others derive the same pleasure from seeing it that I did,Positive

This is currently my favourite movie of all time never before have I been that excited to view a new movie The entire  minutes was an exhilarating rush I truly wish that it were longer that I could prolong this poignant emotional experience The character development is movingly evident by the end of the film we watch these emoji characters grow as individuals and its a beautiful thing to experience The Emoji Movie while targeted at children provokes the responder to recognize an underlying darkness set within the film Such is conveyed through the surrounding impending mortality that this film uses as its basis It reminds us that we too face the threat of mortality and that in itself is a truly moving notion that strikes the viewer completely unawares and allows the film to boast a more mature foundation that only true artists could pull off via the challenging medium that is feature film In conclusion the Emoji Movie was an emotional experience that truly changed my outlook on the world through mature themes and altogether exceptional take on the world of film,Negative

Me and  other friends went to see this movie and we all agreed that it was cringy but also good at the same time which is the reason why i am giving this movie its deserved rating me and my  other friends that saw this movie too i also think that this movie shouldnt have replaced the popeye movie too,Negative
I went into this movie expecting it to be rubbish but I certainly wasnt expecting the astoundingly high amount of blatant racism and homophobia in it especially during the first and third act I specifically recall the scene where after praising Elliot Rodger as a hero Gene and Jailbreak tell all LGBT members in the film that they didnt deserve love then proceed to have a massive orgy with the rest of the characters which was extremely disturbing and totally inappropriate for children I cant believe Sony allowed Tony Leondis to get away with this appalling piece of cinema,Negative
I was expecting this film to be bad Mostly because of the memes But those aside I wanted to watch it for the same reason I do all marvel films Because im the type of demograhpic for it I have to say though I was plesently surprised This film was enjoyable all the way through and had action and such that kept it going well I feel though the cgi for the faces couldve been better but that aside it was not half bad Everyones favourite vampire plays morbius Jared leto Having previouse played joker in the rival studios film he was more enjoyable in this and took on the role well Milo his friend is played by matt smith who I also enjoyed Martine played by adria arjona was also someone that I thought was ok and I like the possibility of a sequal to this movie Overall pretty good,Notr
What in the world was this movie Its a character nobody asked for a movie nobody was hyped about it had a terrible marketing plan and its trying to hard to be Venom which also wasnt good Disaster,Notr
As my title says theres a  reason why every movie which should be rated R and is not wont be as successful as it couldve been otherwise Imagine the latest Joker without RWith Morbius everyone expected a level of production over Underworld  Evolution  but as we know nowdays its impossible for a studio like Marvel to make such prolonged production with much more technical resources than just CGII think most of fans of Marvels Morbius are long matured but they got a movie for kids Also the vampire theme is old enough and it shouldve delivered something surprising,Notr
This movie had promise in the first act I enjoyed it But the third act was terrible It went against everything in the trilogy and what the trilogy actually taught Disappointing,Notr
Best movie i was seen best scene nice cinematography and best idea,Positive
Story is okay But they forgot about actionEven Matrix became generic popcorn movie these days Nothing to remember Nothing new Nothing fresh If youre fan of the franchise you should see it cause there is hope universe will be extended and someday something good maybe came out of it If you didnt saw the original trilogy  nothing for you here,Notr
We went to see this movie despite the reviews Cats has always been one of my favorite musicals Ive seen it  times on broadway This creation was a pile of crap left in the litter box The songs were crap and the acting was worse We had to leave after they destroyed mongojeri and Rumpleteasers song Just save time and money and stick needles in your eyes Ugh hated this movie so much,Negative
Jurassic park was a masterpiece of a film and these new films have slowly killed its reputation Even the cgi is worse Creativity in films as died in recent years and this film proves it The old cast should of been embarrassed to sign up,Notr
The plot is relatively complex for an average watcher like me but once I fully wrapped my mind around it I was truly moved Nolan did an incredible job in this movie pouring out his soul and making a masterpiece The acting was also incredible making me feel like the actors were actually in the situations The overall message this movie conveys can truly change someone,Positive
I cant understand why this movie got such a high rating its a good movie but there are lots of others that deserve to be number  in the best of all time list american beauty pulp fiction Chaplins Buuels or Kubricks movies just to name a few WellIm an old Stephen King fan and the story of Redemtion is good and thrilling and the acting and photography is good as well but its nothing that hasnt been made before dont get me wrong i liked it but i think its just a well made entertaining picture and nothing moreSo watch it and have a good time but dont expect an artistically great work or something all too original,Positive
Like I said The Dark Knight was the best movie I have watched Its my favourite movie I mean Christian Bale was the best Batman ever And Joker was also best Believe me both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger are best,Positive
"Nolans movies always are best
ive watched all of them
the dark knight was amazing",Positive
Its Andrew Lloyd Webbers Cats  what did yall think you were going to see Its a strange musical with a strange premise with strange characters  why would the movie be any different It was true to form The musical numbers are fun and dramatic The cats look weird but thats to be expected considering its a bunch of adult actors playing cats Enjoy the music and bizarreness of it all  its kind of fun Additionally Jennifer Hudson is phenomenal She didnt have to go that hard but she did and we should be grateful,Negative
Definitely better then critics who know diddly squat rate Thought it was funny surprisingly endearing and perfect for both kids and adult Loved the voice overs and honestly thought this was better then I thought it would be The dialogue was crisp and not at all dull or boring and the animation was pretty good Like said dont listen to the mainstream critics they wouldnt know a good movie if it hit them in the face,Negative
Christopher Nolans Inception didnt just entertain meit rewired how I think about storytelling On paper it sounds like an overcomplicated heist film set inside dreams In practice its one of the rare blockbusters that trusts the audience completely rewarding attention with layers that keep unfolding long after the creditsWhat makes it my favourite movie is how perfectly it balances spectacle with emotion The set pieces are iconicthe rotating hallway fight the folding cityscape the slowmotion snow fortress assaultyet none of them feel like empty fireworks Every action beat is tied to the rules of the dreamworld and more importantly to Cobbs internal conflict Leonardo DiCaprio gives the film its beating heart making grief and guilt feel as tangible as any explosion Marion Cotillards presence as Mal is haunting not because shes the villain but because shes the emotional consequence of Cobbs pastNolans direction is razorsharp the pacing is relentless the exposition is surprisingly elegant and the parallel dream levels build tension like a perfectly engineered machine Hans Zimmers score doesnt just elevate scenes it becomes part of the films architecture turning time itself into suspenseBut the masterstroke is the ending It refuses to handhold inviting you to debate whats real and what isntwhile also making you realise that the emotional truth might matter more than the literal answer Inception is thrilling intelligent and strangely intimate Its the kind of film you can watch five times and still discover something newwhich is exactly why its my favourite,Positive
Theres nothing like what those former Jurassic Park sequels Just hope this is the last So hollow and pointless So boring because theres no essence in this movie thats interesting enough to hold our attention Is put up one hand with palm forward the only way to hold off the dinosaurs a hand gesture these wild vicious creatures would recognize and start thinking Hmm thats an universal traditional friendly STOP sign so popularly accepted by our species not to attack Are these human traffic cops trying to direct our movements No Right Turn on RED This is one of the most boring movies so far in ,Notr
I guess haters gotta hate It took a few minutes to get used the cgi fur and odd physical movements but I was surprised that I liked the movie It made no sense in any rational world but it was fun to watch The Dancing was lovely Judy Dench can save any movie and she and Ian McKellan certainly brought the needed grounding this movie needed James cordon and rebel wilson were great as well as were the lesser known main characters Overall better than the screen adaptation of Phantom,Negative
Im not sure Ill ever recover from seeing Ian Mckellen SIR Ian Mckellen drinking that cream,Negative
It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime The cast and the story of the movie are really successful Andy is a passionate character and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence It is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison Oldfashioned prisons in the s are full of bad guy who dont expect anything from the life And  they dont think how we escape here However Andy with his close friend in the prison  Red  tries redemption from this prison by the time  Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison But  Andy approaches to place of exit It is actually amazing  it is really incredible They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life Also Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail After the redemption  they become free anymore It is really an amazing movie Easily one of the best movies made during the s and definitely one of the top prison movies of alltime Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is with out a doubt one of the most over rated films of the s  There have been many intriguing prison movies over the years Shawshank is not one of them Instead its sentimental slop served to uplift the souls of the American people  There is never any sense in the film that Tim Robbins character is in true danger  If the film wanted to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker instead of inspiration Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual in the role of wisdom spouting inmate Freemans character is mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all but he is never treated as a typical person Tim Robbins is good but his character is all good while the prison warden is sure evil Everything is black and white  Shawshank has potential to be great but director Frank Darabants obsession with being Frank Capra ruins the film at every turn,Positive
In  years this film will have a weird cult following and an aged James Franco will make a meta film about it Until then it will remain universally regarded as an utter shambles,Negative
There are some things in this life we will never understand How did the universe begin What happens to our souls when we die How did a movie as bland as The Shawshank Redemption become so overratedIn the case of certain other movies I can at least understand the reasons why theyre overrated But The Shawshank Redemption is so average And clichridden The films moral is basically that hope is important and theres nothing wrong with that in itself Heck  I have no problem with simplicity The problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic The movie treats its borrowed plot parts Count of Monte Cristo anyone and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom I wouldnt be complaining if it didnt pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion However it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours If it had ended moments earlier instead with that poetic shot of the sea I would have had some respect for it thats where the superior original story ends But no the director had to spell things out for his audience Frank Darabont knows how to tell a story He just doesnt know how to tell one with any originality or depthThe movie is partially redeemed by three things The majestic cinematography the powerful score and most of all Morgan Freeman one of the very best actors working todayAs for my rating yes Im one of those jerks who gives a movie a  just to lower it on the top  I think its outrageous how highly its ranked here Even the folks who made it would think its ridiculous to consider it one of the greatest films ever made,Positive
Inception is not just a movieits an experience that reshapes the way you think feel and perceive reality Rating it a perfect  feels almost inadequate because what the film creates for itself goes far beyond conventional cinema Its thrilling intellectual emotional and endlessly immersiveThe feeling of Inception is unmatched From the first moment youre pulled into a world where time bends reality fractures and the mind becomes both the battlefield and the prize The pace is razorsharpnever rushed never slowperfectly balancing exposition with adrenaline Every layer of the dream adds tension and every ticking second feels heavier as the story unfolds You dont just watch the film you actively participate in itWhat truly elevates the film is the sheer brilliance of its performances Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a deeply layered performance as Cobb carrying guilt grief love and obsession with remarkable intensity His emotional weight grounds the films highconcept narrative in something painfully humanCillian Murphy brings quiet vulnerability and depth making his emotional arc one of the films most powerful elementsJoseph GordonLevitt is effortlessly sharp and controlled especially in scenes that have since become iconic while Tom Hardy injects charisma wit and style perfectly balancing intensity with charmThe story itself is Oscarworthy in every sensebold original and intellectually fearless It introduces new ways of understanding time memory guilt and reality leaving the audience questioning long after the credits roll Few films dare to trust the intelligence of their viewers the way Inception doesand even fewer succeed so completelyA cinematic landmark defined by ambition precision and emotional depth Inception  earns its  for being thrilling yet thoughtful complex yet accessiblea film that doesnt just exist in your mind but stays there spinning endlessly,Positive
Im a bit late to the party with all the Morbius fun mostly because I didnt want to spend any money so I had to wait till it came out somewhere for freeIts hilarious but its definitely not supposed to be Its laughably edgy and it takes itself far too seriously The writing is baffling and convenient and the combination of that with the abrupt editing means that things just happen with little reason leaving you a bit confusedOne of the genuinely worst things about the movie is how boring it is to look at The wonky CGI is quite funny but when thats not around everything is just bleak and has that sort of grey filter like an episode of EastEndersHowever its definitely an enjoyably bad movie overall and Id recommend watching it just dont take it as seriously as the film itself does,Notr
As someone that has been watching superhero movies since batman in  as a kid I would say this film is just middle of the road nowhere near as bad as some are making out but I think we are just spoilt for better choice right now even if that choice is another  or  star marvel movie until a really good once comes out and repeats the cycleBut I noticed many reviews keep mentioning that morbius in the movie jokes about saying i am venom only joking but that is just in the trailer for a joke its not in the actual movie so it shows alot of these reviews arent real doesnt mean people that did see it didnt hate it but it does say alot for online mentality of people that dont even bother to watch the film sometimes it was fine but its not something ill likely ever rewatch again despite liking most of letos work usually,Notr
This movie took awhile to get going They were doing so much building of the plot it felt like it was never gonna start Once it got going and this dinosaur movie had some good dinosaur action it was pretty enjoyableIt is a long line of pretty good movies that Im glad we are getting but thats all they are pretty good not great,Notr
You dont fix what isnt broken we were all ok with the trilogy and forgot about it you dont need to resurrect it by making a th movie This movie felt like a cartoon plot was childish and forced performances werent all great and  of the movie are references from the trilogy Fighting sequences felt weird and archaic basically cuz they tried introducing new elements that rather ruined it combined with unnecessary slowmo shotsit had its few fun moments and thats all this movie brought me no joy and will hardly recommend it,Notr
I didnt HATE it But I cant give it a passI feel we should have moved past this point in the Superhero genre The story did nothing that hasnt been done better elsewhereSony is still trying to work out this game Which is odd given how well they stared out the gate with SpiderMan and SpiderMan But since those two they havent been able to find a film that has completely knocked it out of the park without Marvel Studios involvement The Amazing SpiderMan had good bits and Venom was fun but Morbius experience came across as a choreI thought Jared Leto wasnt bad and actually held himself back a bit unlike say Tom Hardy who went all out with Venom Matt Smith looked like he was having fun alsoVisuals were patchy but had some interesting parts While the end credit scenes detracted from an already disappointing storySony dont miss you chances You may only have one left,Notr
The movie might have a few creative ideas of its own and some really good animation but the plot is derivative of better animated movies the comedy in nothing but a neverending compilation of unfunny puns and product placement is everywhere you look The movie nobody asked for and nobody wanted,Negative
I thought the movie was great a bit clunky with its story at times but set up the characters and future of the franchise well Recommended for any fan of Marvel movies,Notr
I watched the first day first show of the movie it was amazing First of all the story was brilliant and unique It is actually very difficult to implement such complex story because there are so many characters and so many explanations of how things are going on and so many levels in the movieThe concept of dreams and dreams inside dreams was unique All the action sequences were very well doneI think such complex stories only great directors can tell because there were so many small pieces in the movie which needed to be connectedI expect this film to be nominated for Oscars because of being unique and very well made movieOnly the directors like Christopher Nolan would dare to implement such unique concepts VERY GOOD I would give this movie Rating    and it is a MUST SEE   Please watch it in theaters ,Positive
The film is a symbol of the excessive demands of the makers The main thing is to squeeze in as much fancy as possible which then seems farfetched The film also gives no time for images and ideas to take effect Also no tension is created by the hectic paceThe minimalism and precision from the first part is missing There is no Matrix atmosphereAnd if a serious film has to work with jokes then everything is clearWith a series the missing  minutes of explanation could have been sorted out somehow,Notr
I will say this for Colin Trevorrow unlike other Hollywood writersdirectors who seem to be actively spiteful towards the classic sagas they are writing sequels to when Trevorrow says he is a fan of Jurassic Park I believe himThats why Jurassic World Dominion feels for good and for ill like the worlds most expensive fan film cramming in nearly every dinosaur known to man and every character meme and injoke from the previous five movies button up your shirt Malcom Get your hat Grant Oh look Nedrys old Barbasol canIm betting that if the great Pete Postlethwaite had not passed away we would have gotten Roland Tembo rappelling from a helicopter to shoot an Oviraptor in the faceThe movie is at least twenty minutes too long  Hollywood seems incapable to make a nonbloated blockbuster today even Bond movies have the running time of The Thin Red Line  and it doesnt have a shred of the wit and intelligence of my beloved first Jurassic Park but I did like a few setpieces the Therizinosaurus the frozen lake and its always nice to see the awesome Sam Neill back so I guess the fan bait worked to an extent,Notr
Cinematic masterpiece with a solid  ratingthis movie is truly exceptional Christopher Nolans genius shines through as the film expertly navigates dark tones immersing the audience in a gripping narrative The meticulous camera work enhances the overall experience capturing every nuanced detail with precision From intense action sequences to quiet moments of suspense the cinematography is nothing short of remarkable The actors performances elevate the film to another level delivering emotive and captivating portrayals that stay with you long after the credits roll In every aspect this movie is a testament to the artistry of filmmaking and a true masterpiece in its own right,Positive
This is the funniest movie of all time I would give this movie a  if I could because its so bad its good Everyone needs to see this masterpiece,Negative
Its interesting how most of the  star reviews are very short this says a lot basically that we dont want this film to take up anymore time we wasted watching itThis movie is made for the late fans of jurassic park the original movie has far more impact the original movie has only  dino screen time where this film has about  dino screen time which kills everything about what jurassic park set out to doThe worst part of the movie is how much the director tries to tie in scenes and recreate scenarios and legendary moments from the original film Spielberg did this because he is a fantastic filmmaker this director did this to please fans Nothing comes good from people pleasing in any situation in life,Notr
I saw the trailer and thought looks quite interesting Then the hype started and I read all the glowing reviews from critics but what the hell do they know Popped to see the film with high expectations cause Chris Nolan has always been on the money Well I could try to explain but wouldnt do it justice Even if I tried to give away the ending there are another  minutes of brilliance to see I cant recall a film had me so transfixed for every secondthrilling clever grand entertaining intelligent thoughtprovoking and utterly mindblowing The cast score the set pieces the paceenough said Whatever youve seen beforeAvatar the Matrixforget themthis is the new bar,Positive
You know what The nostalgia sorta works here for me Its endearing to see the old cast again some iconic scenes recreations now with a sort of poke at the generational gap I dig it It brought me back a piece of my childhood and a movie aint good unless it can connect you to something I dont watch Jurassic Park for perfect plot lines or complexities I do it for the majestic Dino recreation This one just worksThere are also some very uniquely terrifying situations and Ive seen every which genre of thrillerhorror so that was kinda nice The actors were all playing their character really well and they all seems to genuinely like working with each otherOverall I liked everything,Notr
This movie is definitely not as bad as the critics have rated it Its nothing amazing but its not horrible either Storyline was very predictable but far better then most cheesy crap that comes out Id give it a  nothing amazing but slightly better then average,Notr
The entire movie was like a weird furry fever dream Dont get me wrong the cast was wonderfully talented and their voices were beautiful However my brain just had no idea how to process the information given to it Humanoid cat people hybrids are never the move cinematically,Negative
What to say about the Shawshank Redemption I shouldnt really have to say anything because when most people hear about it they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is This movie is freakin immaculate Darabont and Co have created not only the most inspiring film in ages but one of the most emotionally significant films to date The movie teaches things to us that we need to know  messages on hope perseverance and friendship  and it does it with marvelous eloquency All in all The Shawshank Redemption remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen  a master piece of art Perfect,Positive
This movie is a total disrespect of the original Dragonball series The outrageously inaccurate portrayal of OUR Dragonball is just shocking it has got nothing to do with the comic and hell they thought its cool to add crap Hollywood elements into the film which completely destroy the untouchable classic First of all none of the actors resemble the characters in the comic a single bit and just when I thought they would create a cool looking piccolo doesnt necessary have to look completely like the one in the comic but I was in for a rude surprise to see one of the best character in the comic looking worst then ugly duckling not to mention that his role is literally non existence same goes to the storyline which again has nothing to do with the comic Without vegeta trucks red ribbons botsetc was actually the best thing in this movie else the damage done would have been unthinkable and the director might need to look for a temporary hideout,Negative
I just went to see the film adaption of Cats  I think it has to be one of the worst films Ive ever seenThe film itself was largely devoid of storyline and frankly quite boring The visuals were nice but overall it was gaudy The choreography was OK but the vocal performances were questionableThe CGI and the movements of the actors was interesting but only for a few minutes The way the cats moved varied throughout the film walking on two feet or four feet and I noticed a few errors in the sizes of the cats compared to their props  sceneryAll of the sung parts seemed to be recorded dry without any acoustics appropriate to the setting of the scene which really spoiled the realism for me Sounded just like the actors were in a vocal booth two inches from the microphoneSeveral people walked out of the cinema halfway through and I dont blame them I stayed until the end in case it got better but it didnt,Negative
"Though many of us may feel including me may feel sometimes that story is not that good but I will highlight Pros and Cons that I observedPROS
Graphics CGI Sound effects and all other tech used were the best then all previous titles of the franchiseThis is better then most of the recent dino titles of other studios too in last  years their story and graphics both were very worst then even this title like dinosaurs just freed from some where and running in the city and nothing else So this Jurrassic movie is still better then most titles of same genre in last  yearsCONS
Story was not that good of the level of Jurrassic Park  or Missing of horror scare and nostalgia of the level of previous sequels The horror when a person or child is trying to save himself from unpredective dinosaur was missing here",Notr

Everything has been said about this movieI will just say Im still waiting for the MOVIE that can match this almost perfection in every aspect if you didnt watch this then you didnt watch a MOVIE yet,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie I watched this movie for the umpteenth time A movie I would never ever get bored of Written  directed by Frank Darabont this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope friendship  redemption Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins the faith The more times you watch it the more you love it and the more you learn from it Whatever you do dont listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film It has everything you could possibly want in a movie If you dont love Shawshank chances are you are beyond redemption It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece Its in my top five movies of all time I feel so bad about not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late nineties,Positive
"I guess the main reason why I didnt really liked it was the fact that Neo and Trinity were played by original cast but Morpheus and Smith wasnt You can try to explain this throughout the movie but then the story became chaosOn part of the effects its all great and the fight scenes were stunning too but the further you went into this flick the more it lost its attractionIt starts off rather okay with the making of the game but once they do get into the matrix I was lost And why does every flick has to be over hours You really have to get a strong story to do soSo overall nice to see the fighting scenes again and the classic shots from the original but one you have seen and forgot all about the next dayGore

The Dark Knight was probably the best action film Ive ever seen Not only is the design tone special FX sound and music all were excellent but the script was dense complex and thorough The performances from the actors were all very good particularly Ledger who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that weve not seen in a batman character before This may be Ledgers best performance from his all too short careerThe only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the TwoFace make upspecial FX I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series But the director doesnt use too much face time on that character so the look remains shocking and not overdoneCertainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie as it has that as its roots However it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right,Positive
The acting is adequate the story is adequate but why all the fussIt sometimes baffles me why some movies get such high ratings when they are really only run of the millThis is not that bad a film just seen it all before,Positive

I am not a fan didnt even know what Dragonball was until I Googled it after seeing the movie But i am certain that if i was a fan i would have been incredibly disappointed Not only is the plot the characters the action the decor the costumes the effects and even the music really bad but they actually manage to screw up the obvious intentional humor every timeEven so the movie did not bore or annoy me It actually made me laugh mainly at how bad it is but still it was entertaining to lose  hours with it on a stormy day with nothing else to do Quoting from another person you might really get a kick out of watching it while being hammered,Negative
I know there were a lot of hype and excitement about this film but I think its the weakest in Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy Though it does have some strong movie elements such as good special effects high drama and a haunting music score this film is too dark even for Batman The plot drags action and violence are overkill and some of the cast performances were weakAs a fan of the comics I was hoping that this trilogy would follow the comic continuity more than the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher series But it wasnt meant to beWe have a story about Batman trying to rid the city of the remaining mobs but ended up facing a new villain the Joker Later on in the story crimefighting Harvey Dent flips a nerve and turn into TwoFace While pretty good acting Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker was too manic and sadistic I didnt care for the makeup and costume as well Aaron Eckharts performance of Harvey DentTwoFace drove me off the wall  bland as Harvey Dent and much too angry as TwoFace I know Director Nolan wanted to avoid camp at all cost after what weve went through with Schumachers films but the story is too serious and dark I would highly recommend Batman Begins or The Dark Knight Rises over this While also dark those two films had much better character development compelling plots and a better balance of humorGrade D,Positive

Darabonts film about an innocent banker and his troubles inside a maximum security prison with a tough warden Gunton Andy robbins befriends an inmate whose friendship gives him hope and is the backbone of the film Morgan Freeman plays this role superbly in what i think is the actors best performance of all time This is Freemans film though Robbins is great in the lead and Gunton is a hell of an antagonist Everything about this film is perfect so i can completely see why its the rd best film of all time on IMDb I am a big fan and have watched it  times and wouldnt mind on seeing it again later down the line IMDb Rating  MY Rating ,Positive

This movie does not do justice to the anime and neither to the manga James Wang directed this Production must have used him as bait for the audience Pieces of the original story are put together and thrown to the spectators that has to put them together and recompose the picture Lame dialogues acting and CGI Watch something else,Negative
Morbius is the movie Ive ever seen Apparently Morbius was the very first movie ever I watched this movie and I thought this sure is the movie that I have seen of all time If I were to say one thing about this movie it would be that this movie,Notr
Emojijooviee McCormick Meiji worst and poor movie the girl bow nor er em OK Ive this movies trailer and the trailers had a ton of dislikes and idea why this got a bad review and the YouTube trailer thumbnails make me alive here again they save peoples lives from the cringe and all the movies like zootopia and moana are way better than this poop,Negative
Jurassic World Dominion feels like it became a selfparody during the first act of the movie Sure its nice that theyre referencing the past movies in kind but the lapses in logic the annoying deusex machinas at play the apparent brainlessness of some of the characters and the dinosaurs becoming part of Earths everyday socioeconomic hemisphere it was a wasted opportunity and felt like a misleading tease from Fallen KingdomThere was potential here uniting two generations of Jurassic Park casts uniting the dinosaurs in their fight for survival and maybe even showing the fallout of such a situation where dinosaurs now actually coexist alongside peopleThe Jurassic franchise has definitely exhausted all possibilities at this point in time but I think we KNOW Universals are least considering another sequel to this conclusionWhat next Jurassic Stars Where they take the dinosaurs literally to outerspace or something At least thatd provide some more ironic entertainment and become a midnight movie phenomenon,Notr
i like this movie it is not bad it is amazing good excellent wonderful awesome good excellent amazing nice like perfect everything good love it feel it good nice story love it very much nothing bad everything is good really amazing movie i see it must take  stars i like its song and the movie has new idea,Negative
It was a risky decision but I feel like it didnt go wrongInstead of giving us what we expected The movie is more like a meeting with fans of the sagaThe movie does not take itself seriously many times and breaks the fourth wall But this is not just for joking there is a lot of criticism of the industry and the lifestyle of these timesSo thats my warning dont see them waiting for matrix  See it more as a reunion with the saga where we can joke and comment while we watch it,Notr
I love it There was so much here and I particularly loved this take on the Joker,Positive
Ive never left a review for anything in my life but please pay heed to these reviews Its a god awful movie and please save your money And time by not watching Actually hurt seeing some quality actors involved in this production Only a  as  wasnt an option,Negative

In this loving story about a young face forced to assimilate into face society learns that loving yourself is more important even if that means everyone wants you dead And they only stop wanting you dead when you do something nice for them Good Moral Great Movie Ill show it to my  children I give it  poop emojis out ,Negative
Ive been content to lurk and learn on this web site for months but after reading the reams of glowing critiques of this film I felt obligated to get an IMDB account and print a contrary point of viewThe Shawshank Redemption is an obvious thinly characterized visually uncompelling film  Whether its the good guybad guy cliche or the  white guyblack guy cliche its still the same old HollywoodThis is not a film which discovers life through enigmas dilemmas and reflections  It is a film which wears its rather plain message on its sleeve out of    For prison flicks try Dancer in the Dark  Someone else recommended alternative prison flicks Kiss of the Spider Woman and Cool Hand Luke  I heartily agree with those choices,Positive
Incredibly suspenseful movie I was drawn in so quickly to this film only to be tossed around in the huge waves of thrill and suspense in this movie If you want to explore the world like its never been conceptualized before this is the movie for you,Positive
Gospel song and praises still remains one of the best Medium of communicating with God No doubt you will leave to enjoy all the good musics and song been uploaded to Musicbasin,Positive
Zero thought and effort was put into the making of this film I am a big matrix fan and I honestly cant remember the last time I was this disappointed The ending is soooo cringy I just want to cry,Notr
This movie was embarrassing to watch especially because of James Cordon I will be talking a lot about him because he is my nemesis even though he does not know me His voice acting in this movie was squeaky and embarrassing His acting and voice acting and horrible tv show should be studied in a lab because it should be considered toxic waste He thinks he is funny because he has those dumb car music thingys were he gets be lost celebrities on most of them and they sings songs that were only famous  years ago Shame on you James Cordon Your jokes are not funny and you should just quit as nobody find you funny other than  year old uncles who work at the dmv,Negative
"Absolutely not worth spending money and time to watch
Effects are looking cheap and horrible
Film itself is simply boring Not entertaining at all",Negative
But omg this has to be the worst movie that has come out so far in  Baring the CGI which was pretty good and the only reason its not  star everything was off The story was bland the bad guy was so generic with no motive apart from control it was laughable the acting was wooden the plot holes were massive i could go on but theres no point Give it a miss and let the franchise die its already far too slow and painful death They should have left it at Jurassic World as a  off callback then called it a day,Notr

Its literally a movie about Emojis EMOJIS What is the point of it Its a wreck it Ralph ripoff and doesnt deserve to even be in the same sentence as Dunkirk Dont see this movie Dont give it money Kill it Bury it Go see Dunkirk or Baby Driver Also apparently they might get enough money for a sequel Lets not have that Please Those are my thoughts Dont see this film if I can even call it that,Negative
This film is a very very bad film The product placement on this film is straight up ridiculous Also the idea itself is terrible How can you build a good and genuine world around EMOJIS Yeah you cant because they are so simple and generic that it be pointless trying Yet Sony tried and obviously failed at trying Also the actual story itself is also really bad Its also so forgettable that I already forgot what this movie was about What I remember is that its about this really badly structured main character named Gene who is supposedly to be a Meh emoji But instead he does a giant variety of emotions Thats all you need to know about the story anyways bye,Negative
a film about freedom not only because the story has as scene a prison but for the force and grace and precise of creation freedom of actors and director ideas and dialogs whole script and special emotions of viewer it is a rare film because it represents more than brilliant acting or smart script it is a homage for basic values and eulogy to friendship it is representation of a form of revolution who can be considered fruit of a different religious perception it seems be perfect and this is key to be more than a goodinteresting film but an extraordinary cinema lesson Red Rita Hayworth poster and Andy Dufresne that is all at first sigh,Positive
I just finished watching this movie and I am completely blown away Im sat here wondering about life and feeling just like I did after watching Interstellar I dont think theres many movies this perfect but the ones that are are clearly a mixture of great acting amazing directing a perfect soundtrackHans Zimmer as usual and overall an amazing story The whole idea of the movie is of course to leave you thinking about life and wether or not everything real and it definitely succeeded there ,Positive
Why does this exist dont see this movie please save your money and dont see this,Negative
Cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genreThis film delivers a gripping narrative intense action sequences and unforgettable performances that leave a lasting impact on viewersAlso raises thoughtprovoking questions about the nature of morality the price of vigilantism and the fragility of society Its a film that challenges viewers to confront their own beliefs and ideals making it a truly unforgettable cinematic experienceHeath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker in The Dark Knight is nothing short of mesmerizing Ledgers interpretation of the iconic Batman villain is chilling captivating and downright unforgettable From his menacing smile to his haunting laugh Ledger fully embodies the madness and unpredictability of the character,Positive
I had been meaning to watch this movie for a long time but I got the chance only yesterday when I watched it on HBO I can only say that for eight years I had missed a chance to witness a brilliant work Tim Robbins is really good so is Morgan Freeman But the movie is not about any central character The movie as a whole is devastatingly perfect I saw Forrest Gump and thought it was awesome deserving of the Oscar But eight years since I have to change my mind,Positive
You talk about the first movie thats fine But these little clips showing us are utterly terrible And they just kept going and goingSo I gave up after  minutes but then I just had to know what happens in the movie so i watched the rest And its not bad Its good actually Just some things still make no sense Like the clips from the first movie are in all the wrong places We know all the stuff they show us but we dont know what they didnt show us Like who is that group of homeless people Why no flashback here when it would have made senseAlso not having Hugo Play agent smith really lowers the movie by a huge margin Not having morpheus is explained because of the time gap But no Hugo was the worst part about this movie,Notr
This could be the worst thing ever made who thought this would be a good idea Is there still time to delete this film,Negative
It was a great way to end the series It was great seeing all the original characters back from the first movie in  So long ago I give them credit for showing how mankind lives with dinosaurs now instead of the usual dinosaurs escaping from captivity and they have to out run them There were a few points in the movie where the dialogue seemed choppy however there was plenty of action and plenty of dinosaurs and I thought the actors were terrific I saw Top Gun Maverick a few weeks ago which is a repeat from an older movie and I thought they did a better job on that one however Jurassic World is still very good,Notr
I really dont know what is wrong with all the people rating this movie so low I dont know of many perfect movies out there For one you have to have an open mind and stop comparing this movie to that movie or to this or that comic and just sit back relax and enjoy the movieWhen you think to much you can tear anything apart and ruin it Yes I saw some things I would have done differently but all in all it wasnt a bad movie there are many out there that are way worse trust me,Notr
Frick you sony You make me sick To call this video a film is honestly insulting to to every movie ever made yes including The Amazing Bulk The obvious pandering is just the start it tries to pull Blatant advertising of apps unfunny jokes and the most basic plot ever I hate the emoji movie,Negative
im giving this movie a  just to raise the the average vote cause this movie is in no way a  i mean sure its not like the anime but what movie could summarize the whole anime its simply impossible still i felt the dragonball vibe all over the movie it had an interesting storyline with some goofy parts and it was very light it followed the dragonball history but kept it original as for the actors justin chatwin did a good job although a bit different from the original goku one of the parts i liked more was from bulma i think she nailed the character perfectly i didnt like master roshi however they ruined the character and is it just me or does joon park have the exact voice as yamcha overall i liked the movie its not dragonball its dragonball evolution and they did just that,Negative
This movie has everything The cameras the sounds the really cool characters For me its one of few adventure movies worth watching more than once And of course Heath Ledger is as awesome as everyone says The characterization is so much deeper than the other films We get to see multidimensional people with purpose even if the purpose to to kill and maim We care about what happens for a change and we go along for the ride A small criticism is that it is awfully long and it takes so much time to resolve itself Also people do some pretty stupid things considering what a threat this guy is These are little things and without them we wouldnt have the huge finale,Positive
I think its time for Sony to accept that they arent very good at making superhero films Just leave it to Marvel and everyone will be happy This movie sucked,Notr
No matter what they say it is amazing to see this world again So some people say it wasnt like they were expecting but it is the first movie after the trilogy for this reason there were so many explanations about what happened So my suggestion is to lower your expectations because It is a bridge movie to connect the trilogy with the new one but I am pretty sure the next ones will be amazing I am really excited to see what is going to happen in the next movies We must be honored to be able to watch The Matrix again,Notr
The Emoji Movie is a boring and unfunny kids movie Its not creative or original The characters are bad the story is bad and the humor is awful The only positive thing I can say about it is the animation Its actually quite nice to look atAll in all its bad I know  is brutal but I did actually think about giving it a  for a majority of this movie however then there were two scenes that just baffled me in how bad they were I would not recommend this to anyone but I think its watchable for very very young kids,Negative
Maybe its a symptom of lockdown but watch a film as shallow and empty as this and find still find some joyThe film is not subtle nor smart in anyway Its product placement is in your face and the characters are  dimensional It is clear that people thought the premise was enough to make the film work and they didnt need to bother with plot drama or decent jokesBut i still found it just about watchable which is probably due to the amount of utter rubbish I have already watched in the last year,Negative
This movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about life your life       Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins the faith in a dark atmosphere,Positive
Could a movie be any more perfect This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways Acting perfect storyline perfect soundtrack perfect emotional drama perfect everything about this movie is perfectWhen this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and its popularity grew Eventually after many years in the top  of IMDbs top  movies of all time list it hit number  with over one million votesThe story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison As the years go on in his new home he makes friends enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie historyI love this movie The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins And also William Sadler Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it isOverall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit,Positive
This was a nearperfect masterpiece its what Marvel wishes it could do The movie had tons of action scenes and a great storyline it had the best Joker of all time Ledgers approach to Joker wasnt the corny s Joker where he was making corny cartoon jokes Ledgers joker was a psychological joker that messed with peoples minds and had them looking in every which direction Bale was phenomenal he was an incredible Bruce Wayne was disappointed that the original Rachel dropped the movie though It was an amazing experience to watch this movie  would recommend anyone to watch this movie if they would like to be entertained for  hours its worth itRIP Health Ledger you were gone too soon,Positive
It was boring uninspired predictable and was a  advertisement for other companies and brands such as Just Dance Candy Crush and essentially Apple itself I was also excited for the Popeye movie and i was disappointed that it was canned for this garbageThis is what youth entertainment has become,Negative
This franchise should have been extinct since  The original cast is here for the paycheck The new cast is laughable The plot is Does this movie even have one The CGI looks fake as hell Its boring Nothing specially thrilling happens Theres no payoff Rubbish,Notr
Whether you know about emoji or not whether youre adult or child  this is a great fun movie the bad reviews are unjustified watch it as youll not be disappointed ,Negative
The film was exactly what I expected some of the jokes managed to make me chuckle Most of all I found that I identified most with Genes mother as her attitude mirrored my own throughout the film,Negative
Wow this movie was Amasing ever since i was borned i have been struggling with depression and Emoism i have been trying to be glad for twenty nein years now thing were exiting in the cold war with Nukes because i was waiting for nuclear annihaltion because i was so sad i looked to religion and prayed everyday to the Flying Spagetti monster papa Stalin didnt help me either but then this movie came and made me happy the jokes the humor hell even the emojis made me happier,Negative
Worst movie of  by far Full of cringy jokes horrible story line why was this movie created,Negative
I think this movie is everybodys favorite Batman movieNolan approached differently you know this is the super hero movie but it seems like real not fantasticActors and actress did great job so did Nolan of courseAnd and and of cource Hanz Zimmer he is one of the best modern composerI wrote actress and actors did great but i have to write exclusively about Heath Ledger What a wonderful actingAnyway this is the one of the best movies ever  ,Positive
Another generic Jurassic Park movie full of bad CGIActors are good but the CGI makes the movie look tame and unrealisticI wish they made the Jurassic Park movies like the first two movies More practical effects as it looks more realistic compare TRex or Velociraptors from the first movie with this Its day and nightThis is just another cheap maybe not the budget but how it looks generic way to actionpacked child friendly movie like Hollywood is spamming out nowadaysI wish movie makers had the balls to take chances like they did back in the day when Hollywood was goodNow they rely too much on CGI because its safe But it makes the movies not have a realistic feeling to itId say I will give it a  star max and thats solely because of the actors makes it watchableWithout them it would be a  star,Notr
Finally I get to watch this masterpiece or to put it simply the renaissance of cinematographic art or in English the best film of all time I simply also have no words to describe the validity and awesomeness of this film just as this film has no end Not literally this film has no end no end to its awesomenes and genius The screenwriters left us with no end in principle so that we would be speechless which happened to me too forever trapped in the abyss of the time continuum in the endless temptation of this film until we become one with it until we become MORBIUS  This movie is a typical example of CINEMA which doesnt need a sequel to satisfy our hunger for more viewing of new scenes And I liked the song that says have sx the most Its just another added bonus in the level of positivity and genius of this movie because right now Im going to have sx,Notr
I just want to start this by saying I went into this with zero expectations because of all the reviews I was amazed when I watched it I found myself genuinely loving it I thought it was a very fun kids movie I think people sometimes dislike things because they think it is cool but one thing I was taught from a very young age was to not be too cool to enjoy things I know it sounds cheesy but I swear some people just dislike because everyone else dislikes it too I am not saying that you have to like or thats the reason why everyone say they dislike Im just saying try not to be negative Its a great movie that is nothing more than it needs to be It does have some bad parts like a bit too much consumerism but it is so feel good This is just my personal opinion but think twice before you decide the movie is going to bad,Negative
The reason this movie is rated so high is because people joking and rating it  I know you people hate this movie but please dont rate it high because it will just make the movie look better then it really is,Negative
Indeed This is the best movie in history An outclass script And beautiful narration,Positive
From the very starting of Inception one will be engrossed by the sheer intensity of the film The beauty lies in the aspect that it deals with such a common psychological state but still creates an awe Another aspect of Inception is that it binds the viewer with the journeyInception is a movie where we see the magnitude of a director Christopher Nolan can handle psychology better than any contemporary director but the way he handles the architecture of mind and the juxtaposition of scenes is somewhatmind boggling Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his most nuanced performances till date The rest of the cast is brilliant Comic moments created by Tom Hardy is refreshingInception is not a movie it is an experiencewatch it to just experience it After that watch it for a second time to bow to the genius of Christopher Nolan,Positive
Christopher Nolans dark knight is still one of the best superhero movies if not the bestI think this is the first movie that villain become more attracted by Fans more than the herohe really gives the better class of criminal the movie needed It is a good combination of good action and awesome storyline,Positive
If you havent seen this film watch it as soon as you can Maybe youve had the chance to do it but just skipped it because you thought it was one more story in prison Yes and no YES because most part of Shawshank Redemption happens in a prison but NO its not like the others Its much betterThe story you may know more of it in the Plot Outline is really interesting and the performances are just impossible to forget There is a little of everything drama friendship violence love and dreamDream of Freedom Thats the title in PortugueseMy Rate ,Positive
Haha his movie is absolutely horrible Nothing redeeming Yet another Jared Leto movie that is trash Dudes a terrible actor and his movies are bad Its about time to stop seeing anything with him in it,Notr
My go to movie on a Friday night Excellent all around,Positive

Why they put it  Its horrible if they dont put that Moments they movie a litlle better in summary You waste time in your live seeing this movie is a long ad",Negative
It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me Watching very very impressed What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway Acting on cues can say is enormous Theres no posturing Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyones lips Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into Finals if he so exhilarating you a highquality music And finding that deserves really deserve I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars Will remain as the best film in more than  years I believe wholeheartedly sites Definitely one of the best films in the world,Positive
Totally enjoyed the movie Acting is good as well as the story line,Negative
Very complex idea executed perfectly An immersive ark masterfully crafted with great editing and direction,Positive
The higher production values needed for film reveals this as an extremely thin and clotheared musical The arrangements sound thin and the choroid dull Some startling bad performances by the star cast Judy Dench and Ian McKellen excepted Its amazing that this actually got released Who did they think would like it,Negative
  I dont know what all the fuss is about with this one when the quality matches that of either Venom movie and while I didnt love the visual design of the vampires I thought the cinematography VFX sound design and Adria Arjona who is now on my Actors to Watch list really elevated the relatively weak story,Notr
Heath ledger was the main thing here perfect fit for joker absolute crazy yet so tricky  Best acting so far and deserved those oscar ,Positive
Joker was absolutely amazing Simply a must see film for anyone who wishes to see the best joker performance,Positive
The best movie of Nolan above memento and inception I highlight above all the direction and photography of the film Its incredible what this direct does with a franchise that was in decline this trilogy is pure gold especially with this movie,Positive
Was it perfect No Was it fun Absolutely There will be a lot of things people will pick apart this movie for I for one didnt mind it It was a solid closing chapter to the Jurassic World trilogy It was a nice balance with the newer stars and the OGs A lot of hey I know you from such and such When the casts get combined I was so happy I love my OG Jurassic Park crew They were my main reason for being excited and I wasnt disappointed in that regard A lot of fun sequences really helped keep me entertained It couldve been a bit shorter but Im still happy with what I got from it Go in to have fun It wont do you any good going in expecting a masterpiece Plus it has a ton of baby dinosaurs they were sooooo cute,Notr
Ive just been to see a preview screening of The Dark Knight Now Im no film reviewercriticwhatever but this film blew me away Blah blah blah on all the performances they were brilliant Heath Ledger is a truly psychotic Joker As one of his final performances he will be remembered as a villain who thrived on kaos and mayhem Maggie Gyllenhall Christain Bale Gary Oldman Michael Caine Morgan Freeman and Aaron Erkhart all gave such Oomph to their roles Technically the movie was fantastic With all the explosions you expect and the body count wasnt too high May be a little too much for children under  to grasp Go see it Go on Buy your tickets now,Positive
I almost vomited when I saw the preview for this movie Its like taking a child raping it and then throwing out of a moving car at  mph and leaving it for dead Did anyone in the making of this movie even watch one episode of DB DBZ or DBGT Special places in hell are reserved for asses like this For one the whole base of the story is completely off not that it makes a huge difference because the acting alone is enough to make even the smallest of fans to the Dragonball universe cry and hang their heads in shame This is nothing but a baseless rip off of one of the most celebrated anime classics and unfortunately more and more movies are heading in this direction Can we please get a director with a set of balls to direct a movie based on the actual characters and plots of the story they are trying to show,Negative
I have seen lots of movies where the storyline is so basic and straightforward that it is quite boring to watch but this film is has a more complex storyline and you will still understand it and enjoy it,Positive
As a kids movie its okay I mean the animations nice and the kiddos will find it funny but as a movie for everyoneThats the problem The story is generic or plagiarizing Wreck it Ralph  the animations average and the characters are either meanspirited or bland The exception is Gene who happens to be the only likable character,Negative
Oh boy what do i even sayi knew this movie would be like every other movie but my god i didnt think it would be so bad from immature jokes to just plain aggravation this movie is everything bad that it could have possibly been If you are somebody who likes animation but doesnt care about Story Character Entertaining and pretty much anything else than this movie is for you Overall this movie is bad and should have never been created,Negative
Seriously if ever theres a film that people should be forced to watch its this The acting in it is truly perfect the storyline in very very well written and the ending is one of the cleverest and most misleading endings I have ever witnessed This film can and will be enjoyed by people of all ages relatively  check parents guide for suitability and will keep you in suspense for the full duration Unlike in most other Hollywood films the twists in the storyline are very well executed and it is in no ways cheesy or cheap Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his life without making his fellow actors overact The Shawshank Redemption blows every other prison dramas out of the water See it at all costs,Positive
What else were you expecting Loved the call backs to previous films Action seemed a little repetitive for some of it but the concept of putting the two main characters against each other in the matrix made sense Story had a few holes but if you sit back and enjoy then you wont walk away disappointed Not saying Im gonna award an Oscar but if you thought anything different going into this then you dont understand Hollywood,Notr
"Worst movie ive ever seen Borderline unwatchableNo plot
Almost no script except songs This is ok for this type of film if the songs are good They arent
Poor CGI
Poor acting
Dreadful forgettable characters i dont even remember any of their namesEssentially its a terrible version of Rocky Horror Show that has human cats instead of men dressed as womenThis film has no positives aspects whatsoever people were laughing in a bemused way when the film ended Ive never seen that reaction in a cinema beforePS Cats are my favourite pet",Negative
Its okay Jared Leto and Matt Smith do a great job the storyline is okay and the CGI isnt the worst weve seen from marvel I think the primary issue is that its came out when Marvel has had their best with Endgame and SpiderMan The movie does not shine like some others The build up to the finale was great the execution could have used another pass through the editorTldr its fine but the ending isnt polished,Notr
This movie is just garbage My sister  I wanted to watch a movie and this was on our recommended I knew this movie was bad before watching it but decided to give it shot since I was bored and had nothing to watch The idea of the movie was creative and original but the execution was terrible  full of cliches Some scenes were so bad  cringy I had to look away like the part with the Just Dance app and the Emoji Pop dance The only reason I gave it  is because the idea was cool,Negative
I use this movie in my Interpersonal Communication course  The relationship between Red and Andy provides rich examples for my students to look for as they write on important issues of Interpersonal Communication such as the symbolic nature of language powerful and powerless speech posture intimate and social distances territory chronemics various types of listening and self disclosure  Many young students struggle to relate inclassintext examples to their own lives and I use this movie to give the class a common experience to discuss and better understand the foundational elements of Interpersonal Communication  ALWAYS a good experience for my students,Positive
No matter what peoples have said about these Jurassic World films i have enjoyed these so muchThese brought piece of my childhood backI just love dinosaursThis was great ending to trilogyThis brought back old and newI really liked how this film started with multiple storylines about different thingsAnd how they connected one by one so nicelyMore about ethics of prehistoric species in our modern worldSome really good science fiction stuffGood actionGreat visual effectsOverall well made filmBut most importantly so many different dinosaursAnd this one had so many new speciesI was impressed that im still able to recognize so many of themAnd of course there is my childhoods favorite one GiganotosaurusI really felt like i was child again while watching this filmAnd of course old faces from Jurassic Park meet new charactersThis was just greatLot of fun momentsSo entertaining,Notr
Before seeing this film I had had only  girlfriends but now that I can converse about the fine arts I have   would recommend,Negative
Typical storyline of jurassic world Vfx are also not amazing But superb mind blowing audio work with the superb clarity of dolby atmos mixing But still the first jurassic park movie is better than this The dinosaurs are very realistic though it was  This is not up to the level but nice and treat to watch Definitely watch in a theatre Otherwise useless,Notr
The movie starts off with a horrible intro The whole is just a cliche and the plot is what you expect an emoji goes around a lot of apps we use and they use subtle hints to womens rights Theres a fine line between a childs movie and a fake PG movie This movie crosses it many time over,Negative
The beginning was ok even interesting bonding somehow The middle was interesting even though foreseeable but the ending sucks The last  minutes destroyed the whole movie Packed with overthetopaction and in consequence boring somehow A movie which is exchangeable to many other movies by its qualities In the last  minutes it looked like they wouldnt know how to end it and stuff it with action to make an excuse of it After that the last cheesy parts were unbearable No I dont like that Im a Marvel fan and was in a rush in the MCU by phase  which had a pretty awesome peak in Avengers Endgame I also like the Marvel TVseries at least most of them But this movie is dull,Notr
I knew nothing about this movie before going so I had no expectations I thought it was a really fun movie to watch as a casual fan of Marvel movies I also saw The Batman recently and I actually found Morbius much more enjoyable to watch Batman was pretty cheesy to meSo I was pretty shocked afterward to see how poorly rated the movie is Yes the movie ended too soon it felt like it didnt have much of an ending However I just took that to mean that its a simple origin story setting up future movies Admittedly that is a lazy approach but its better than feeling like the movies being stretched too long with useless filler which I find the case with many filmsSo if you want to see a really fun movie with exceptional sound and visuals Morbius fits the bill for me Just dont expect a masterpiece or a profound story its clearly intended to be the first of many of the character although given the abysmal ratings maybe that wont happen as they intended,Notr
"This does not translate well onto film
First half didnt care what happened to anyone wondered if this would be the first film I walked out of
Second half became more interested in the characters and the vague storyline Things that I hated
Jennifer Hudsons weird beard effect
Jennifer Hudson crying through the whole film sing the damn song and stop with the gurning
Ian McKellen lapping out of a bowl
Judi Dench singing Love her hate that someone said sing it Judi
The balloon ride What The Hell
In summary the stage gave it the magic on film its just weird and cringey",Negative
The basic premise that dinosaurs are everywhere on the Earth opened up an entire world of possibilities for the script writers and unfortunately they fell back into some very basic Hollywood themes that are no longer interesting and in fact are more often than not insulting to the audienceThe legacy characters were so good in comparison that it should have been obvious to everyone the final movie would have been a lot better with just them with a cameo by Chris PrattTo try and explain the plot would take six different reviews because there were basically six plots that are very loosely connected and mostly dont resolve I could go into them and discuss them but that would mean I was putting more effort in than the screenwriters didSince its Hollywood in the s you know the good guys and bad guys based on facial hair and skin tone As Quentin Tarantino has commented many times we have regressed to s style serialized televisionRun from this one like you are being chased by a velociraptor,Notr
This movie was so awful i left after  minutes First time i ever walked out of a movie I came in with low expectations but wow i was just blown away on how terrible this movie is The acting was awful chow yuan fat looked foolish and could be his worst acting ive ever seen from him Every other actor looks like they have never seen the show before because their characters are way off I know they tried to americanized this movie by changing the settings but it just didnt work out at allThe effects were OK but nothing ground breaking and nothing weve not seen beforeSo in conclusion please do not watch this movie The acting is so horrible and its absolutely nothing to do with the anime except the names oh man i was so furious when i walked out,Negative
Ive either seen worse movies or the hive mind mentality on the internet is stronger than ever This movie isnt even that bad Yes there are some pacing issues its heavily edited and it has a slow fairly simple plot but there are some impressive visuals and action scenes the subway scene and Matt Smith delivered an intimidating but campy performance which made the movie a lot better,Notr
I see everyone smashing this movie yes it does not follow the anime to a key they took this movie and turned it into real life which to me live action is all about they did a great job taking something totally impossible and spun it in a way that really could be true dont hate the movie because it doesnt follow the anime they did things in this movie that have been practiced for a very long time you can harness your Ki and use it in ways similar to what they do in the movie not to the same extent but it was trying to put a realistic spin on the dragonball series and thats what no one saw good movie and i have been a DBZ fan since the s,Negative
Cancelled Popeye for this smh why,Negative
Hehe chuckle I dont even know why I am writing this review Perhaps the movie literally sucks  Yes you heard me sucks Anyone who has seen the original Dragonball Z animes probably are looking very hopefully to this movie So did I I went to the cinema with a few friends with loads of expectations Didnt care if there were notknown actors And i swear the first  seconds of the movie passed and I said  I want my money back But i didnt leave hoping of seeing a bit Dragonball  No this movie is so utterly crap I think it makes the writers of Dragonball Z cry Extremely cheesy acting plot story this movie is hour min long what the fck  It almost feels like they want this piece of misery as soon as possible GOD THIS MOVIE IS SO SHT You already know what happens near the end Everything deserves a  When the credits came I nearly shat myself I went home sat in the sofa and watched the Original cartoons Do yourself a favor and do the same Abysmal,Negative
I dont know how a concept as abstract as dreams can have a movie so amazing done on them but it was done as perfect as possible Fitting score light comedy great action this movie has it all The chemistry and acting is perfect The premise is explained so naturally and doesnt seemed forced to explain how things happened You do have to pay attention and not miss some details  in the end it is an unforgettable film that will be remembered as a classic,Positive
Who ever made this movie I feel sorry for There was no great content or storyline I felt I got dumber watching it by the second,Negative
Ive never seen such an unrelevant movie before Its just so dumb and nonsensical it is like a bad mix of the Lego movie and Pixels Just do not watch it,Negative
Its a film about emojis or emoticons if you preferSo check your expectationsIt was cute enough My favorite part was Sir Patrick Stewart voicing the Poop EmojiWorth a rental if you have a young one that loves emojisNot the best movie in the world and definitely not the worst,Negative
This is not a bad film per se had it been about  minutes shorter I would not have been too offended But I am genuinely perplexed as to how people can rave over it   on all time list at time of writing There is virtually no character development the plot is overly complicated and riddled with holes and contradictions Frankly you dont need to suspend disbelief so much has have it surgically removed and flushed down the toilet By the end I was wishing I was in a dream within a dream policed by a completely arbitrary set of nonsense rules  anything to get me out of that chairIs this really the same man who gave us Memento,Positive
Ok loads of people hate this but there is no CONFLICT,Negative
Lets be honest people just want to be popular and hating on Jared Leto no matter what the man does gives people those likes and reacts In reality hes quite a talented and diverse actor but the script for the movies is what lets him down Side note Joker should never have been in Suicide Squad he is not part of it Morbius is nice easy to watch short Marvel film Nothing spectacular but also nothing as boring and pretentious as Eternals The movie has an easy to follow story some light bits of comedy a love interest and some fight scenes like any other Marvel movie You dont need to invest too much into this to enjoy it My only criticism is during the flying scenes the effects are a bit jarring to watch Other than that I liked Leto and Matt Smiths performance in this movie A nice and simple  out of  movie,Notr
This is the greatest film to ever be created Its full of wit charm and Family Guy funny moments My favorite part was when the hand ate his own puke classic humor that never gets old The plot is fairly simple our main character Gene is a meh emoji Gene struggles to fit in because he has dynamic emotions Gene then goes on a quest to become static and that concludes my review,Negative
Pulp Fiction Shawshank get out of here Theres only one movie to watch Its The Emoji Movie This brilliant artwork is a masterclass in every way Never again will I watch any other film but this,Negative
I watched this after all of the hype and the memes died down waiting for a terrible crap fest It honestly wasnt bad In fact it was almost good Im no movie critic and Im probably easier to please than some but I enjoyed it for the most partSome things were rushed and confusing and I did start to check my watch towards the end cause I was starting to get bored so I guess theres my criticism Also I didnt like the ugly vampire facesIve seen some people complaining about the lack of blood and violence and I guess I get that since its a vampire movie and all but thats not really my thing so it didnt bother meAll in all it wasnt great but it was entertaining,Notr
MorbiusOverall it was GoodI expected so much more but basically it was an origin story for a vampire Well get real how many vampire movies have I seen from Dracula to Twilight and What They Do In The Shadows I know every nuance about vampire life and yet here the movie presumed we knew nothingJust as the movie was starting to flag in came adult Milo played by Matt Smith he dominated the screen and the stark contrast between the method style of acting and Thespianism could not have been more noticeable It was greatTo me the jury is out on Jared Leto he has the look but not the charisma he was proficient in this role but nothing more than thatI really enjoyed the CGI and the way Jared moved flew glided and transformed the rest was unremarkableIm giving this a firm  outta  it was well worth a watch even if in conclusion it was quite a mundane origin story,Notr
This movie must quite literally be a DREAM come true for manyFirst for MrNolan himself If he is by any chance watching the screening of the movie amongst general public he must be delighted with the fact that  of the audience would be simply spellbound  must be scratching their heads till they start balding  would be shouting I hate MrNolan for he took them into a maze that lasted for  minutes and did not tell them the way out of it Sheer genius Is he a human being at all Then for the cast If they ever had dreams of acting in roles that are so complete and original in every possible sense then they can stop acting now and retire for all they can dream of has been achieved in a single movie Hats off to the entire cast Last but never the least for us  the audience This is what we secretly hope when we buy a ticket for a movie that we get our moneys worth for every cent we pay for I am pretty sure most people wont even hesitate to pay for the second time to watch the masterpiece that is InceptionAnd oh by the way Spoilers Haha If you have not watched the movie do not worry a jot No amount of spoilers can reveal the actual story This movie is beyond all that Just make sure you go in with a open mind because when you come out of the theater I bet you would have thousands of ideas running around in your head like headless chicken It is a movie experience unparalleled We doff our hat in respect MrNolan for your Idea has been etched onto our mind probably forever You Sir have achieved Inception,Positive
Morbius is literally a vampire at the end of the day You cant have a vampire without blood Plasma Youve gotta be kidding me For the spiderman animated series its for children so fine call it plasma but come on The audience below the rated R audience doesnt even know who morbius is mostly obviously not allThe audience is people over  and they made it pg Thats its worst fault I liked the characters and story Im not mad im just disappointed,Notr
 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledgers Joker The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever madeThis movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight despite these movies being in a series The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki Ultron and ThanosReviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube This movie is still the greatest film of all time,Positive
"I remember many years ago when this movie came out and I saw the trailer It felttoo odd to where I purposely chose to pass on watching it Randomly I saw it on Netflix so I figured it cant hurt actually to watch itYes It did hurt this movie is beyond bad and deserves its awards for being badThe only possible good part of this movie lies with the character designs Everything else is terrible beyond belief Its not even possible for me to describe every single bad thing in this movieTo only address some of the flaws
Story holes
Lack of explanations
Wrong emotions in various scenes
Some propaganda
etc",Negative
"Ewwww this movie is horrible
Sorry but not sorry",Negative
This is the best superhero film to date Heath Ledger has one of the best performances of all time and the entire story is so captivating The Joker is horrifying and hes a great challenge for Batman If you havent seen the Dark Knight and you are a superhero fan you better rethink whether you are actually a superhero fan,Positive
I was really tired when I watched this movie and lost the plot but that doesnt matter because everyone on this website is leaving bad reviews anyway I wish Texas Battle would have lived up to his roles in Sexy Urban Legends and Richard Blake should have had more screen time I would give it a zero but Im giving it a  because the dragon balls look cool,Negative
Movie was enjoyable if your a  year old James Corden deserves better than to play a thumb in a stupid movie thats for kids under  It wasnt God awful but it seemed like it would be a Nickelodeon movie that never went in the theaters If I could describe it with one emoji THUMB DOWN,Negative
This was just awful We ended up counting how many times Chris Pratt holds his hand up to the dinosaurs Jurassic Park was MAGIC This was a bad gas station bathroom in comparison Do not waste your money,Notr
Been super hyped and left super impressed Wasnt surprised about dodgson being a replaced actor though and a menace and dumb Also i dont understand the woke negativity of jurassic world  As i was completely fine with it and not seeing what the critics saw The story was brilliant and thrilling and very action packed and menacing And very adorable And the legacy and current cast blending is somewhat outstanding This movie gave me so many memories in many scenes with how the scenes played out The issue is dont take someone to see a film if they dont understand the story arc Just dont take anyone with you who lacks interest Otherwise the experience for you will get ruined Ive seen all the jurassic films going way back to the first film in  The hype for me was worth it,Notr
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life Tim Robbins is really a good actor and thanks to him this movie is such a success Also Morgan Freeman is really brought me the story The story is excellentthe time has just flew with this movie This movie just gets better with every showing Theres no some special effects and that is just greatjust men in prison uniforms talking to each other Everyone must watch this movieThe Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen I do not judge it by its technical merits  I dont really care about that I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best The best movies are ones that touch the soul It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul,Positive
I found this film to be neither the greatest scifi or not film ever nor did it suck the way some recent commentators seem to think I did think it was quite good Leonardo DiCaprio has finally grown up and is an outstanding actor Ellen Page was very good as well I had never heard of her until she was recently in some TV commercials in the US which told me that lots of other people know who she is For a pretty young actress her role was  asexual In only one very brief scene would it have mattered if the role was played by a manBut the best thing about Inception was its originality It was not a sequel remake remade TV show or remade comic book which is all that Hollywood seems to churn out these daysAs for its complexity I was able to follow quite well certainly well enough to enjoy it The few points Id missed I read in the FAQ section here and frankly Im not sure I would have gotten them on a second viewing aloneI understand why many folks are miffed by its high alltime ranking Yall just have to understand that so many voters are young people who have not seen or do not like classic cinema so recent films will always be overstated It will be interesting to see what Inceptions rating will be twenty years from nowI recommend checking it out,Positive
Maybe cuz I grew up in the s and s this would he a decent TV movie I would watch So I dont understand the bad repFirst off the acting is not half bad especially by Jared Leto Second a vampire Marvel character is interesting I wonder if there could be collaborations with Werewolf By NightIt should be noted that the plot is neither mind blowing nor bad Its a cookie cutter plot for an origin story Thats not bad Its just that the Marvel audience has had two decades experience with origin stories it mightve been better not to be so lazy and to serve up a more unique way to tell the story Im not sure that I can point to things that are bad More like the delivery was just mediocre as was the overall experience primarily because there was nothing new save for the vampire angle if truth be told,Notr
I love all the jurassic films with a negative here and there on them but this one i just have more negative views than positive ones it was nice to see the original cast back good couple of scary scenes but other than that i didnt enjoy this film,Notr
Christian Bale as Batman Heath Ledger as JokerNeed anything else to say,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is currently number one on the IMDb Top  list I dont particularly agree with that but it is a truly great movie nonetheless It is moving and compelling and it touches the heart and soulThe story is set in the s and it involves Andy Dufrense Tim Robbins a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison As one would expect he is very unhappy at first but then he leans that theres something deeper that nobody can take away from you hope As the story unfolds over the years Andy eventually becomes very influential within the prison and gains the respect of other inmates especially Red Morgan Freeman with whom he develops a special friendshipThe story isnt original or creative and its relatively simple and a bit predictable but its compelling moving and memorable and theres a bit more to it which I wont go into The movie puts the viewer right into the footsteps experiences and emotions of the characters Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on great performances They really bring out their characters and offer true depth and emotion One of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person may be imprisoned even for life but the spirit can never truly be imprisoned The movie conveys this moral message very strongly and it truly touches the heart and soulI am very glad I watched this movie It is a truly emotional experience,Positive
I get what they were trying to do for this movie but the execution was frankly horrifying The look of the cat costumes kept drawing me out of the movie and full into the uncanny valley Say what you want about the music and the songs the costumes and how everything was scaled to the actors being cat sized just didnt workThe stage show was much better See that if you can Avoid this at all costs,Negative
I have always known Morbius as a SpiderMan villain However going into this I knew they were going to change him up Rightfully so I get what they were going for They should have gone with a R rating This would have given it the edge this movie needed without going too far into horror Instead they go with Ole faithful PG and it sucks some of the life out of this one It doesnt take too long for Morbius to become Morbius and the special effects are GREAT With that being said there is something missing A great antagonist It felt forced like they HAD to go the way they did And that makes for a more predictable flick Which is what it was always gonna be I just wish they realized that as well You dont have to go to the theater to watch this one You can wait till it hits a streaming service Not awful but it could have been ALOT better,Notr
This for me is film at its best The acting Tim Robbins in particular is amazing Morgan Freeman is his usual wonderful self also the screenplay the production thewell all of it I could rave about it until Im blue in the face but Ill spare you and myself that I must have watched it over a dozen times now and with every viewing I still get as caught up in it as I did the first time I saw it For me thats one of the marks of a special film Im dont really want to use the term uplifting yet again but it is the best way to describe it Highly recommended,Positive
There are those who didnt want to be bothered with the philosophy the ideas behind the matrix trilogy who didnt want to think deeper and thus didnt like the sequels This movie will have the same fate It explores several themes what happens after the prophecy is fulfilled How are people controlled by marginalizing their faith their ideas their legends their stories What role does human connection play in giving people power and freedom of thought Emotion is easier to manipulate than rational thought The balance between hope and the pursuit of dreams vs Being held back by the fear of losing what you haveSo well done and a wonderful continuation of the original story and even adds to the depth of the original three True matrix fans will be enthralled and captivated,Notr
Smoke a little weed put the mind in neutral and forget that the collars around the kitties necks have a tendency to move just slightly slower than the necks themselves Dont ask why one cat is stripping off her skin to show more fur underneath  and certainly dont ask what her outer garment would be made of Really just dont do itIt never ceases to amaze me when a director takes essentially bulletproof material like this and says Hey lets see what I can do to really screw it up Still it had some nice moments that lasted maybe a few seconds apiece and some intriguing ideas that lasted even shorter time The background were in the main charming but clearly meant for another movie altogether Maybe a French musical with Gene Kelly But not this one,Negative
I knew it would be bad so I didnt have any expectations you could say I watched it just for the heck of itand I still regret it so much Dear God it was like watching Power Rangers shooting magic Everything was bad the acting was bad the special effects were bad the storyline was bad for goodness sake it was so bad I couldnt even laugh at it Even if you try to watch it as completely unrelated to the mangaanime its still utter crapI realize that recreating a story from s isnt easy but I just cant understand why they had to make it even more cornyand if youre trying to make it more realistic you should stick to it to the end,Negative
What do you do if your mom gives you  Anybody You go get a  pack of Krispy Kreams But honestly this film turns movies like Avatar and Creed upside down This film shall sweep the Oscars and I cant wait for a sequel This film made me cry tears of happiness PS I do not actually think this was amazing viewing it made me wish EVERY SINGLE phone on the planet was destroyed It was a poor excuse for a movie It really ticks me that someone in there RIGHT MIND would cancel Popeye for this shite Oh and when I said in my Work of art paragraph this film made me cry tears of happiness I meant DEPRESSION CRIPPLING DEPRESSION,Negative
Its Batman Drama ApocalypsoIt cant get any betterA must watch movie for all superhero movie fans If spiderman wrecked havoc in the Hollywood industry being a superhero movie here comes a batman to challenge all the spiderman movies together at one goHeath ledger was just outstanding and unparalleledI dont know about posthumous but no one can do joker any betterThe movie with its thrill and action was breathtaking and the dramatization and performances were power packedYou have to be a fierce and a harsh critic to find lapses and faults but i think its going to be hard for anybody to poke negative comments at itBeautifully crafted and wonderful directionThe director should be applaudedWhat else can I sayI give  now to be safe but id love to give it a ,Positive
Inception is a truly mesmerising experience This movie is completeacting on another levelthrilling action sequencesHans Zimmers breathtaking soundtrack Storys originality and screenwriting is genius Inception is the movie of the year and the movie of our dreams,Positive
"Morbius is one of those movies that is good when it is good amazing when it is amazing and bad when it is bad what I mean by that is there are some parts where it is truly amazing there are some parts when it is good or just okay but when it is bad it is bad very b
ad especially during the times where he is riding his journal  diary that drags on forever However the amazing moments make up for it every time Matt Smith and Jared Leto on screen together it is a amazing scene and they are on screen together quite a lot There are some story details that drag on and it is kind of a lackluster origin story On the other hand if you look at it for what it is and admire the amazing action scenes then it is a great movie Like I said when it is good it is just good when it is amazing it is truly amazing and what it is bad it is very bad",Notr
I traveled over a hundred miles to meet with my friends in the big city so we could all experience Morbius together Morbius is easily the peak of comic book movies I would not change a thing,Notr
The plot was a mix between Mission ImposibleStranger Things  two different teams teaming up at the end and some Jurassic park at the end So it was the multiverse of no plot so badly written that I wonder if I could do better with the same budgetIts sad just sad and boring,Notr
This movie is a bland  predictable as it gets Believe in the reviews  avoid at all cost smh I wasnt too hyped going in to see it even more so leaving Time I can not get back,Notr
The songs are great as are the musical numbers Jennifer Hudson Jason Derulo and Taylor Swift all sing and purrform their rears offOnly negative was a really creepy Idris Elba who almost looked like he was going to hang cat dongBut as i hinted at in the title the film sounds great and has some pretty visuals It also has some crazy surprises in it that Ive never seen in a movie beforeIt wasnt a good movie But then again Cats isnt technically a good musical either Its all about the songs and musical numbers And the performers here all delivered,Negative
This is by far and away one of the best Hollywood films made in a generation The drama was compelling the acting was admirable and complimented the story to perfection The writing was exquisite and placed a balance on leading dialogue and narration This is a great example of what film making is all about It doesnt rely heavily on movie magic but instead uses camera movement framing and acting as equal tools in delivering an amazing story to audiences,Positive
Let me begin by addressing the criticisms of this film that its either too slow too complicated or superficially emotional All of these claims are completely and utterly misguided and wrongInception is a movie unlike any other It combines heartstopping action mind bending psychological concepts and deep emotional conflicts wraps them in a tight perfectly edited package and drop kicks you with them in the face The cool part is that you wont be surprised at how little you understand but rather how much you understand The scripting and pacing is so well planned and pieced together and everything is explained in the perfect amount of detail which serves to make the end of the movie a mindblowing climax of epic proportionsScoring by Hans Zimmer is to die for Its a mysterious combination of elements of Batman Bourne and Quantum of Solace which are all revolutionary scores and it completes the movie But lets be serious everything completes this movie Joseph GordonLevitt DiCaprio and Ellen Paige all turn in rock star performances The only character that feels underdeveloped is Fischer who comes off as cold but whose emotional transformation isnt entirely convincing Luckily the rest of the movie is so engrossing at every moment that this does not detract from the overall experience Nolan doesnt need to fall back on highbuck CGI either The sets locales and visuals are stunning without being overbearingThese gorgeous visuals ludicrous editing brilliant scoring a synergistic cast and a plot that makes you think and rewards you for your mental effort combine to transform this from a movie into an amazing mental journey,Positive
Please do not make the mistake of watching this movie Odds are the creators think the target crowd is either small children or people who like movies who are so bad theyre good which means the movie is probably made  on purpose so people will watch it due to curiosity And masochism,Negative
This movie is the Meh emoji and how he has a lot of other expressions besides MehI watched this movie with zero expectations this movie is a product placement piece of trash the moral of this movie is text more And its terrible its just SO bad,Negative
A great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some point but One user put it very well when they said that the films essential message of the human spirit conquering all is very uplifting an everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homilyThere are several films that deliver the same message just as well if not better Jim Sheridans In the Name of the Father springs immediately to mind That film has a similar theme to this one wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it but is a much better film IMO Whats even more heartening is that its also trueLike I said Im not dissing the film it IS great From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged Freeman is excellent but then whats new the direction is perfect because its so unobtrusive to the story and the film in general is uplifting I just think its nothing particularly new and it has been done better Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video releaseI gave it an  To me this fact proves that I love the film just not as much as everybody else seems toI think this adaptation is on a par with the short story which was also excellent I honestly cant agree with  on the top  list though Is it just an American overreaction to the movie or is every other nation as awestruck by it Please feel free to email me for discussion on this or anything else for that matter of  I dont think it would make it into my top  filmsAh well lifes all about opinions,Positive
When I watched this movie I felt like I had watched something similar before Oh wait It was SpiderMan and it was way betterThe only reason you should watch this movie is to tell your friends Its Morbin time and also not to watch it themselves,Notr
Awful but im giving it a  because it was not as bad as street fighter the legend of chun li There is no doubt about it this movie sucked but it is so bad its good If you want to enjoy the movie do not think of it as a DBZ movie make believe this movie has nothing to do with Dragon B all Z and only then would you enjoy itWatching this movie with high expectations is the worst thing to can do The only thing this movie has in common with DBZ is the names they use in the movie so dont expected anything you were use to seeing in the cartoon show In conclusion the movie was not that bad when you dont think of it as a DBZ movie but more of a normal action movie,Negative
Im a big Stephen King fan and I wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation Some of Kings work has been great on film but others have not translated well No fear As others have noted this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity The script is great the directing is wonderful and the performances are unbelievably good To give you some idea of just HOW GOOD this is the first time I saw it was on an airline Problem was the headset didnt work and there werent any other headsets The movie is so good that I couldnt stop watching itand this is a movie heavy on dialogue If youve never seen it do yourself a favor NOTE Its even better with the sound,Positive
Edited in the quickpacing style of many Marvel movies that would debut later this action packed film keeps you moving alongThe story is seen mainly thru the eyes of Goku who lives with his grandpa but doesnt know where he comes from or who his parents were His uncertain beginnings make him timid around his love interest but the events of the film quickly propel him to grow and overcome his challengesWhile it may not hold true to the original series in some ways the movie was intended to be an alternate interpretation and it plays well for the screen Despite a relatively low budget the cast of characters and special effects bring the story to life and keep watchers engaged While it has received much critical review from the DBZ fanbase on its own Dragonball Evolution is an enjoyable film with inspirational themes sure to leave you with a smile,Negative
The reunion of characters and iconic scenes can warm the heart of any Jurassic Park fan however outside of those moments the story fails to stand on its own It seems the direction of the film is often sidetracked by implementing these nostalgic moments even some iconic dinosaurs were merely reduced to memories of better scenes in the past,Notr
What the hell was that How in the world could Hooper watch this and still release it This goes way beyond weird its downright creepy at times which is magnified by all the bazillion closeups Thats not the way to watch this show You have to see the whole stage because there are things going on all over the stage no matter which character the focus is on With a stellar cast such as this youd have to really go out of your way to produce a monstrosity like this Im sorry to say that thats pretty much what he did I like Hooper Hes put out some really great stuff This is not one of them,Negative
As I said in the summary there are too many reviews for this movie and its among the best movies of all time So why I wanted to review it Because this movie touched me so deeply and I found it so great and powerful that I have to say my opinion at all costs This is out of my system now I can go to the reviewTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a masterpiece and only a idiot wouldnt watch it or hate it Everything in this movie is perfect the dialogue is clever and well written with many great lines included also in the narration by Morgan Freeman the cinematography is great the soundtrack is among the best that were ever heard in s movies and the performances are very strong and heartfelt Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give their best performances in their careers Robbins is hard to empathize with at the beginning but more the movie goes on more you come to like him Freeman also narrates the movie and here is suave easy to empathize with and likeable as in all his other movies And also the supporting players in the movie are good including James Whitmore in one of his final roles as Brooks HatlenMy favourite scene apart the tearjerking ending The scene of the inmates listening to the Mozart aria through the speakers So you dont have to like prison dramas for liking this movie Yes its depressing and sad in points  but is also perfectly and cleverly written and acted and deserves all the praises that received A movie that has to be seen at least once and if you dont love it I suggest you to go to a psychiatrist,Positive
There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to This is one of them,Positive
you cant get more from a motion picture Morgan Freeman undoubtedly is a great actor and finding him as supporting actor in movies has been a culture in the modern cinemaThe movie have a great plot the director did a great job concentration on the story have a solid field and the scope to keep you sticking to your chair the movie have such a dialogue delivery that you have to pause if you even blink your eyeShawshank Redemption as the title is tempting so is the movie the star cast is great the performance cant get better and criticizing the all the rules and regulations of the society challenging the so many other other things the movie becomes a legend to the todays actors enough war movies enough jail breaks you have seen in movies but its all inspiring all contributing to the society and the diamond to the industry and the milestone for the coming actors is this Tim Robbins performance is great as he lived the role and the eye stretcher movie shawshank redemption,Positive
Was going through my DVDs and spotted this as a red flag Removing this from my DVD collection Waste of space This is movie is so far from capturing anything dragonball They could have made a better movie with a bunch of cosplay people from comicon,Negative

This movie was far ahead of its time It had the best picture soundtrack brilliant acting decriptive characters masterful storyline as in example illustrated the ideal prison life to the bone  and was first of its kind to come out with a unbelivableshocking ending If you havent watched this movie yet you are depriving your eyes from the amazing it craves The ending is so beautiful one cant dare to imagine,Positive
I totally adored the concept of hope in this film I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers thats pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy Now Morgan Freemans got talent I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank You know theres a lot more to say about this movie its too good too be true Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes the most moving scene Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place Im starting to regret not reading any of his novels And kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie,Positive
I am a huge fan of Jurassic Park always been The new World series was not great but it had its moments with a descent plot and dinosaurs being in the centre I was looking forward to Dominion Unfortunately the third and final movie does not deliver and probably is the worst of all I am not going to go into details but it feels as if someone wanted to record a movie with dinosaurs but lost the essence behind it The film has a lot of dinosaurs in it multiple species but the randomness poor plot and lack of heart from the director make this a forgettable experience,Notr
Ive been so excited for this movie Morbius is one of my favorite characters from the Spiderman s cartoon And I love everything vampires so this should have been a homerun for me But the story is so predictable it became a snooze fest The relationship between Morbius and the scientist was very shallow and uninteresting Matt Smith was the saving grace in all scenes he was in and the relationship portrayed between Morbius and him was lovely And thats it Thats one of the few things that was entertaining to watchI really wanted to like this But weve seen so many origin stories at this point the script and dialogue has to be Somewhat good This was dreary and poorly written ,Notr
I didnt see this sober and neither should you I repeatedly thought I was tricked into watching hours of video game cutscenes,Negative
I loved this movie In my opinion it comes in nd after the original Jurassic Park Its a dinosaur movie for God sake what are people expecting I loved the return of the original cast They were in the movie more than I expected Its slow to start but once the storyline merged the two sets of characters it was fantastic I am ready to go see it again,Notr
One of the best movies out there I highly recommend it,Positive
This  is the worst thing i have ever seenThe budget is scaryIt could be as good as the Lego movieBut instead we get the emoji movieSony need as much money as possible in order to get sardines to live on Please Tony Leondis never NEVER make a new film or just make the fidget spinner movieDab the movieThe cold boys and finally just make red bone forever ,Negative
Theres a lot of trash reviews about this movie and I understand its individual opinions but I feel like theres a ban wagon of reviewers out there that are bound for negativity That being said this was a solid movie To me its as solid as the first Venom movie was Its not going to break many records if any but it was enjoyable to see a relatively unknown Marvel character come to the big screen The visuals were more B Jared Leto did great I didnt care for Tyreses character and the villain was a throw away but the battles were fun and the story was decent I liked the Easter eggs and cameos and Id be happy to see Morbius again in future movies I gave it a  and am happy I saw it,Notr
I cant describe the hate I have for this Does it count as a movie or a minute unskippable ad,Negative
So this isnt a great moviebut its a film about Emojis for kids so surely you cant go into it expecting an animated equivalent of Citizen KaneFor some reason my yr old likes this film so I have been subjected to it on a fairly regular basis Its bright its colourful and a bit of fun I dont think its much worse than some of the other terrible films of a similar kind and if you just take it for what it is then it isnt that badIt would appear the writers have been given the Emoji brief and have had to create what they can within this limited world There are some decent lines in it and some interesting uses of the subject of smart phones The voice over performances are decent and Im sure if you look deep enough Im sure there is a moral to the story,Negative
Nice title   best one i have seen my dude couldnt get any better,Positive
An excellent movie with an amazing performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker,Positive
Im a pretty big fan of Morbius after Ive seen him in the s animated SpiderMan series and read some of his  comicbook run Morbius The Living Vampire When this was announced I got super excited and throughout lockdown  it was one of my most anticipated upcoming comicbook movies It was a crazy letdown with a messy script bad writing uninteresting characters VFX that varies between really good and just awful a terrible final battle and a really abrupt ending Jared Leto carries this movie HARD,Notr
If you are looking for an inspiring jorney to feel the magic of life you should stop searching and watch this title,Positive
I hated cats afrer this movie  Zatar can make better cast than this,Negative
Terrible Just terrible Im sorry but this movie deserves to be shut down Also all of the reviews that claim the movie is  stars are BOTS I repeat BOTS They all use the word Masterpiece similar grammar personality and a couple of them were somehow the same account name and profile picture Do NOT waste your money on this movie,Negative
"Everyone is crazy Go see this movie You wont be sorry This is a cinematic masterpiece It changed my life The CGI is spot on I totally believed that these were some sort of human cat hybrid Better movie than Joker The story was so deep I always thoughts were dogs until this movie opened my eyes Now every time I go home to my cat I bow down to it Cats are everything and this movie gave me a brand new perspective We can stop making movies now Nothing can top this That M was put to good use What a spiritual experience Love love love this beautiful movie Cant wait for the sequel
NOT",Negative
This is one of those movies that you must watch it with one sit from the beginning to the end without making you lose any interest in it I also watched the continuation of this movie it wasnt bad at all there are few movies which i like to watch with one sit and they are really few i personally dont really like superhero movies that much but this one really got my attention i mean it has Christian Bale Batman in it of course it was going to be a really enjoying movie i recommend to anyone who have not watched the movie to see it really is an impressive one really sad that we can not have a joker like this one anymore i mean Heath Ledger Joker really hit that high joker performance he was and still is for me the best joker in a batman movie,Positive
One word Amazing Not much to say besides thatChristopher Nolan brings us a new Batman against joker story that takes the title for bestThe idea that Batman cant do anything The idea that joker is the best criminalHeath Ledger was amazingYoure on the edge of your seat the entire timeThere are only two things Im complaining about and that stopped me from rating it a  When Batman is going to save Rachel he couldve saved both by sending teams out each way to each location but he didnt Why Harvey Dent blames Batman for the death of Rachel Why He knows perfectly well that Batman is at least trying to be the hero here So when Batman tells him to point the gun at the people responsible why the heck does he point it at BatmanOtherwise this film is if not the best one of the best films Nolan has brought us ,Positive
If you were asked to guess the plot of this movie by watching the last  minutes off Fallen Kingdom you would stand no chanceI thought we would spend the film with dinosaurs running riot on earth Ruining towns attempts at domesticating things like that But no Instead we get like a spy movieIs it nice to see the old characters Sure but because there are two groups on two completely separate missions it can feel lob sided and underdeveloped Crisp Rat and BDH literally spend the whole movie journeying to their destination That is there plot Take planearrive at climax They may as well have not been thereAlso the CGI just looked bad It looks like cartoons Like Dinosaur King Just look at the first Jurassic Park movie the dinosaurs look so good they feel real but I never felt like were are real here,Notr
Just watched the batman and i had to go back to a movie actually worthy of praiseEverything about the dark knight is just great How the shots was made the music the tone of the movie and the underlying storymotive,Positive
The first Jurassic Park was a thoughtprovoking science fiction film with enormous entertainment valueBut after the first film pseudoscientific realism was thrown in the trash can emphasis was placed just on the popcorn factor making these movies falling into the spectrum of a good visual festival with a mediocre narrativeThis film is perhaps the one that takes this principle further The story is generic it serves as a pretext to go from action scene to action scene with dinosaurs explosions bar fights impossible pursuits with vehicles on land and in the airHowever it still has some wellcrafted nostalgia factor I really enjoyed seeing Sam Neill Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum together once again And to the films credit these characters are more than glorified appearances taking up quite a bit of space in the filmConclusion Its a brainless action movie with plenty of nostalgia good character moments and a corny bplot narrative that is very bland and shallowI enjoyed this movie more than the previous one If you dont expect much from it it might be fun,Notr
"Its this kind of film that piques your curiosity because it might just be so bad its entertaining in a cheesy campy way Except its not
Go and spend  hours on something with more suspense better character more entertaining value like watching your toenails grow",Negative
As a Dragon Ball fan this was clearly not anything even similarAs a movie fan this was atrociousIts hard to understand what kind of drugs all the people involved were in,Negative
Despite some of the harsh reviews this is a good movie It might not be what everyone is expecting especially from the short teaservideo that dropped before Christmas but as an adventure movie with dinosaurs it delivered Also its not a horror film either its a family film With all that in mind the cast do a fantastic job and the effects are faultless Sound editing is intense in all the action scenes score is good too The old and new cast work well together and have great chemistry Jeff delivers some awesome lines in his unique style I didnt know there was a code and many others Bryce is wonderful in every scene and her character has become super likeable compared to the first Worlds film DeWanda is incredible a sassy and interesting new character that steals her scenes Also its a movie about the dangers of genetic modification coexistence and ecology too a point that seems to be lost on many viewers Go see it,Notr
As a fan its everything you would want Im not going to do any spoilers but obviously the original crew is in the movie and the most recent characters are also featured and it is a great and balanced combination of the current and previous generation,Notr
Ive seen great Marvel films and I also seen the worst Marvel films ever made and I would say that Morbius is somewhat a Borderline Marvel To meit would be in the league as the Tim Story Fantastic Four filmsAng Lees HulkElectraX The Last Stand and Daredevil I mean if you got time to kill and would to fill in the voidwell by all means check it out sometime but dont except a Black Panther or Avengers Infinity War type Blockbuster for this film isnt it Just enjoy it for what it is I will say this thoughJared Leto makes a better Morbius than a Joker Maybe Morbius will be better in the sequel that is if Sony and Marvel decide to do another one in the future,Notr
Not much else to add to the other reviews really Its a long film with a boring plot and flat characters They should have just stopped after the trilogy I dont think Id even bother to see anymore if they do any Dont waste your ti e watching,Notr
So many troll reviews professional and just regular peepsseems like this was gonna have bad reviews no matter whAt before it even came outdragged my  year old who was kicking and screaming about not ever wanting to see it we saw it he liked it  I liked it kinda fun movie winning awardsoh of course not but on a Tuesday night in April a solid fun movie ,Notr
The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare movies that gets everything right Its not flashy or loud but it hits harder than most films ever could The story of Andy Dufresne a man wrongfully imprisoned for murder unfolds slowly and patiently but never feels dull Every scene matters and every moment builds toward something that actually pays offTim Robbins gives a quiet steady performance that grows more powerful the longer the film goes Morgan Freeman as Red is the heart of the movie The chemistry between the two feels effortless You believe this friendship because its earned not forcedSome movies try to be profound by forcing big moments or dramatic twists Shawshank earns it by just telling a great story simply and honestly,Positive
You could describe The Shawshank Redemption in a number of ways engrossing drama riveting character study topshelf prison movie But its nothing it not a shining example of the power of the indomitable human spirit You root for Andy Dufresne from the very beginning as a man unfairly targeted by fate and you want desperately for him to succeed    somehow Mixed in with all of this is a wellwritten story about friendship and even a little bit of revenge to sweeten the deal As a Stephen King story its a classic and a faithful screen adaptationAnd that cast is impeccable,Positive
This film is easily in my top three favorite films I return to it time and time again still captivated Bravo to everyone involved in this timeless production,Positive
I literally didnt even know what was going on half the time its like a dream in a dream in a dream in a dream in a dream lol,Positive
After seeing this movie I think that Ive lost about  IQ points This film should be erased from the planet This film was more disturbing than every single horror movie Ive seen in my life put together This was a waste of my time energy money and brain cells This movie was a piece of poop emoji here  Stay away if you value having hope in humanity,Negative
Agent smith says things like OMG and robot sentinels give fist bumps now Though failing to capture the magic of the first movie I could appreciate the other sequels for trying to expand the universe and keeping the same tone This one purposely makes a mockery of itself and calls it self awareness Ill stick with watching the first one only for now on,Notr
This movie has everything The production and cinematography is exceptional The story line is original and forces you to think and challenge your thoughts Its a perfect balance of imaginative and complex The acting lives up to their names to deliver top notch performances,Positive
I honestly expected the movie to be horrible and it was Bot only was the story just plain boring but the post credit scene made no sense at allHonestly this is a huge stepdown from venom Venom was a alright franchise and the fact this movie was SO bad makes me loose all hope for future movies like kraven the hunter This film is bad and for sure a passDo not see it no matter what,Notr
Grostesque fanciful interestingly repugnant yet I cannot look away Perhaps one off the biggest disappointments in Cinema history,Negative
Were there a God Id like to think he wouldnt make people this dumbThis just the absolute worst movie ever made and Im still pissed off about it  years laterThe only movie worse than this is Transformers the last knightI cant believe I cant rate this a Whats funny is the people that rated this  also hatred it theyre just too nice to give it what it deserves I clicked to read into the reviews cause I couldnt understand why anyone would rate this higher than the lowest possible ratingI doubt anyone even watched one episode as over half the names are pronounced incorrectlyI agree with folks saying you dont have to be a dbz fan to hate this movie Fan or no fan this was a terrible movie,Negative
Four years after Isla Nublar was destroyed dinosaurs now liveand huntalongside humans all over the world This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine once and for all whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with historys most fearsome creaturesThe movie is driven by action and visual effects with little care given to things like character development or a wellwritten plot The pace is fast and the movie is exciting but its forgettable The dialogue is often cheesy and the acting is just okay with Sam Neill Jeff Goldblum and Chris Pratt phoning it in There are a few themes that pop up such as the dangers of messing with nature but they are quickly abandoned in favour of more actionJurassic World Dominion is a movie that is best enjoyed as a mindless popcorn flick Its not going to win any awards but its entertaining enough If youre a fan of the franchise youll enjoy it If youre not this movie isnt going to change your mind,Notr
Not a lot more I can add to the reviews that have already been written The directors obviously thought that by throwing a load of A list actors at this it would somehow make up for its short comings James Corden was terrible as usual,Negative
There is a wall in my house The wall is a simple wall eight feet tall and fifteen feet wide it sits in a corner in the basement It has been painted beige with a few coats to cover up the bumps and scratches from coats before Its got its idiosyncrasies the way the light jumps off the paint the not so even drywalling underneath Stare at it long enough and it begins to speak to you  or at least allow you to speak to it Maybe theres something to the wall  or maybe its just my romantic illusions of inspiration and contemplation that bring life to it My point is this  staring at that blank wall for two hours is far more inspiring interesting and enlightening than watching even just two minutes of the cinematic colonoscopy that is Cats A film so awful so ridiculous and so void of substance its very existence is an affront to musicals film and theatre Unless youre a fan of so bad its good cinema stay away This is a watershed moment in bad movie history,Negative
"Watched this with my  year old daughter and really enjoyed it Was shocked to see that it had a  rating Gave it a  in order to offset that horrible rating because it deserves better
The movie concept was unique and had an interesting perspective Just like Toy Story brought our toys to life this movie brings your appsemojis to life and I thought the concept was executed really well There were also some good lines in the script
Deserves  stars",Negative
The actors were exceptional playing their roles with  adamant skill creating a killer cast which helped propel the movies momentum as it was hyped and psyched up prior to releaseUpon watching the movie each minute was a blast as much as a puzzle itself thinking was imminent and necessary hardly giving you time to lean back and take a bite of your popcorn This movie isnt for you and your girlfriend to be all touchy in but take her along if shes interested into movies which get your mind going like a maths test Come to think about it you can sort of see matrix through the backbone of the movie but it is clearly magical none the less The action scenes were perfectly timed making it adequate rather than overdone and time consuming The dialog which i believe is a VERY important factor to movie success surpassed me blowing my mind away at every moment Leonardo DiCaprio has been on a true roll with a back to back spree with shutter island and now this living up to audience expectations with his actingMind blowing action scenes intellectually battering dialog talented actors and a plot with a very imaginative basis and you get THE TOP MOVIE this year INCEPTION I recommend it to all unless its hard for you to understand complicated movies,Positive
Sure it was a good prison movie and much better than many other movies Ive seen  But this does NOT beat Godfather Star Wars or Casablanca in any way  Watch this if you enjoy good performances and good plot but dont expect a presentday classic ala Forrest Gump,Positive
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen,Positive
Ok as I give this movie a  it is going to be hard to be critical but I feel as though that is the responsibility of anyone who doesnt rate a movie a First of all the acting was sensational  as good as I have seen in a long time The direction was great and the script was great And it turned into unexpectedly a true buddy storyI could only criticize a couple things  one of which was NOT the length   I found it a little troubling that most of the criminals were extremely nice guys  except for the obligatory bad guys in the shower I also have to confess a real distaste for the homosexual overtones  especially early on But then what prison movie attempting to depict real life could leave that outAlso prison movies in the s s and s are not my favorite genre however one of the advantages of prison movies are that you really dont care very much what period it takes place in Anyway that is just personal preferenceAll in all it deserves the praise it gets Im very glad I finally took the time to watch it,Positive
Normally when I fall asleep during a movie Im gutting and have to try to figure out what I missed However on this occasion as I woke up and realised I had missed perhaps half an hour of Cats I felt a huge surge of reliefIts so rare that I feel nothing from a movie absolutely nothing,Negative
I dont get why so many people are saying this is bad The villain was great battles were tense the plot was well paced Really good Please go watch it and you wont regret it at all,Notr
This movie is an absolute masterpiece The story is incredible paired with amazing acting unforgettable music and beautiful cinematography This movie really deserves everything Easily one of the best movies of all time,Positive
Though you thought the plot will revolve about the coexistence of Humans and Dinosaurs they failed to do thatStill love the CGI of the Dinosaurs so worth the watch,Notr
I cant believe Sony cancelled one of the most classic cartoons of all time just for this EMOJIS Popeye is considered a classic among kids and adults alike but no instead we got a ripoff of WreckIt Ralph Lego Movie and Inside Out combined  superior movies WreckIt Ralph being my favorite Unoriginal concept and clichdannoying not as annoying as the minions from the Despicable Me series characters sums up the movies ratingreviews If you want to find a better movie I recommend either the  movies Ive mentioned or the new  releases Otherwise do not take anyone here or ask them to go to this movie,Negative
This movie is proof that we are doomed as a species,Negative
SeriouslyAn entire movie about exposition instead of entertainmentWho edited thisWhat a total cock upGet someone else in to edit the dailies into an entertaining movieWhat a wasted opportunity Youve spent the money you have the footage you forgot to engage the audience in a compelling storyBoo hoo agonise over a really really basic ethical dilemma for the entire fracking movieMore interested in the sequel setup than an engaging storyBoring boo hoo agonising over and over Just tell a fracking story without  hours of agonising over justification for a non existent antiheroGive Morbius a purpose other than sooking over his existence Boring boring boring,Notr
I really enjoyed the actors specially Jared Leto Very impressive indeed I like his styleThe movie was entertaining although geared towards a younger audience in my opinion which is odd for movies staring LetoThe visual effects however were very over the top I understand that they were supposed to convey the bat senses but they were very very over done,Notr
The emoji movie plagia in continuazione Wreckit Ralph The lego movie e Inside out  pieno zeppo di stereotipi e ha una morale tanto banale quanto forzata,Negative

"Another one of those overlong morally righton movies that never rises above average  saved only by the actingIts bleedingheart politics dignity of individual maintained in adverse conditions is playedout well enough but actually lacks any real dramatic tensionDufrane is a twodimensional character who seems to go through the drama by numbers  theres never any doubt that he will triumph in the end its only a matter of howTim Robbins has done many more interesting films than this one  try The Player or Bob Roberts if youre looking for dramamoral ambivalence and how they interactBasically there are a lot better prison films than this one  Jailhouse Rock for startersLike most Stephen King stories  quite prosaic There was a story in here somewhere but it got overinflated and somewhat lost along the way
One to watch on a rainy day when theres nothing better to do",Positive
It seems like Leonardo DiCaprio is really going for these Psychological thrillers lately which is good as he seems to pull it off quite nicelyAs usual Christofer Nolan has created another great movie which is well shot superbly acted and grips your attention from scene   although at that point you really have no idea what is going on My one point of criticism on an otherwise amazing movie is that he takes the concept one step too far Towards the end keeping up with whats happening where becomes a full time task and although I dont want to come over as stupid one less would have made the film flow much smootherEnjoy,Positive
This movie is literally everything that is WRONG with the movie industry It perfectly shows the absolutely laughable and desperate state that Hollywood is in right now The dialogue of this product is so poor it honestly feels like they wrote it in an afternoon with little to no thought or creativity put into itI am appalled by the unoriginality of this piece of animated garbage If youre going to watch an animated kids movie with a similar plot that actually has some effort and care and attention put into it then please just watch Inside Out WreckItRalph or the Lego Movie THOSE are good films that are memorable and fun to watch  this isntI beg of you DO NOT go watch this pile of tripe ironically just to see if its any good or not because it is not I absolutely promise you,Negative
Shocking effects pathetic editing weird casting and just feels and looks like it was made by amateurs or for a bet Really bad Avoid at all costs,Negative
The only good thing about this movie is the Kamehameha and awesome technology Otherwise Gokus acting was terribleAnd even if this movie would be like a prequel to Dragon Ball Z They should make a sequel to this movie where Goku became epic They recruited Piccolo Tien and Krillin Gohan is born and Vegeta finally arrives on the scene and that Hollywood can finally find out what a Saiyan is Oh yeah did I mention the fight scenes were terrible Fights were too short and I wanted them to more epic Well if you would even take the time to make a sequel and market it during Dragon Ball Z Kai or during shows with viewers who even know what a Dragon Ball is well then sure life would be great,Negative
The Morbius movie was a bit better Because I have not made any expectations here You see the movie is not so bad movie Action was good in some places And there was no logic in some of these places ,Notr

After the secret life of your toys the secret life of insects the secret world of monsters under your bed and the patently ridiculous secret world inside your brain is it so surprising that some braindead executives would attempt the secret world inside your phone More kids these days care about phones than toys or their own brain so wouldnt that make it more important All those people who praised Inside Out to the skies are to blame for this monstrosity of a movie and the Emoji Movie is the next logical step for hooey childrens entertainment,Negative

I absolutely had a blast seeing this dinosaurs flick Its heavy on nostalgia but its fun It was a lot of fun to see the mix of both the new and the old Im sad to see this series is over Overall not perfect but such a awesome cinematic experience,Notr
Im utterly baffled about who is the intended audience for this film It is probably meant for younger viewers but it clearly looks down on modern youth as easily impressionable simple minded and not tech savvy Are they trying to appeal to youth or insult them Any modern child or teen can see through this stereotype and the relentless technical inaccuracies The other reviews have pointed out the other major flaws so I wont go into detail  this film is plagiarised messy and padded with advertising and meaningless filler content The visual animation quality was actually pretty good though,Negative
One of the greatest movies of all time The movie encapsulates all the values that give hope patience and motivates us all to never give up The characters their performances is so unique The musical score is by one of my all time favourite composer Thomas Newman Timeless Masterpiece Must have Must Watch  Must Share,Positive

but fails to deliverEver since Ive seen the trailer for this movie Ive been looking forward to seeing it The trailer promised so much but in the end it was one of those movies that had all the best bits shown in the trailerThe concept for the movie is original and I was expecting the narrative to be another Despicable Me The Lego Movie or Wreck It Ralph level quality Unfortunately from this reviewers point of view it wasntThe movie has good moments but they were far and few between to save it from its lowly ratingI tried to like this movie but with characters that failed to connect with me and too many tryhard moments it just disappointedAnyone older than  will probably find this movie tedious,Negative
This movie is just plain disappointing to say the least I dont care if this is an adaptation of Dragonball The only reason why I gave it a  out of  rating was for the special effects and production value which were semidecent I dont understand what was wrong with the original storyline that needed to be changed and messed with Its the original storyline that made fans love Dragonball in the first place If it aint broke dont fix it I think this movie would do a lot better if they stuck with the original story and had better casting The real fans would flood the theaters to watch it which would bring hype to the movie for new viewers that dont know about Dragonball kind of like how Watchmen did Street Fighter was horrible and they expect to do a sequel to it this movie was a travestyI guess next up will be Thundercats and Voltron for Hollywood to mess up for me Thank you Hollywood for ruining my childhood memories,Negative
This is considered the worst movie of  and the worst animated feature to date This movie maybe fun and colorful thanks to the computer animations but dont be fooled its really bad I feel bad that Sir Patrick Stewart has been wasted in this ridiculous film as he is one of the most respected actors those this not the first in which any acclaimed actor has degraded themselves to be part of any nonsense movie like Al Pacino in Jack and Jack back in  which the worst of allNo words can i describe in this movie but its all completely candyanddigital garbage and Sony is wasting their money on producing this piece of filthy and colorful bloody trash Its so boring absurd and horrendous Recommend to families even children not to watch this insidious piece of garbage for their sake of their morality and their innocenceOne simple word to tear it apart MEH,Negative
I think the ratings on this movie are harsh It is a kids film to be primarily enjoyed by kids not adults and from what I gathered at the busy cinema  it was My  year old certainly enjoyed it And to be honest I didnt think it was that bad either and Ive sat through some unbearable kids movies,Negative
It is not something never seen before but it is on the same level as  Marvel moviesThere were some unpredictable moments in the movie and characters had decent depth but nothing really spectacularThe effects and the action scenes were entertaining especially the Echolocator effectsAll in all it is an average movie that in my opinion deserves a rating higher than  at leastI guess people still hate Jared Leto for his Joker adaption,Notr
I saw the reviews and decided to watch it to see what was so bad about it bc I was bored It wasnt that bad though I actually enjoyed it It doesnt reach DisneyPixar level with extra details to make the fantasy world more realistic  like Inside Out and Ralph Breaks the Internet and especially doesnt reach the fee emotional impact that DisneyPixar achieves but it was amusing and entertaining A good animated movie that kids would love and I laughed at the jokes,Negative
Shawshank Redemption First time when I heard this name I had no idea what Shawshank is all about I must accept the fact that I was not fascinated by its name but luckily I managed to see this movie This movie is awesome it will fill you with hope when you start loosing hope at some point of time in your life Thats the power of this movie I have seen this movie maximum number of times as I have not seen others Story goes this wayA man who was wrongly convicted murder of his wife and her lover He got two life sentences back to back He felt that he might not be proved good husband but he was not a murderer so he started planning to dig the tunnel to be free from this The way he dig the tunnel and the person who helped him in his project was the crux of this movie So it was his hope that was kept deep inside his heart that provide such a power to escape from the ShawshankPlease rent the DVD and watch it you will surely find it most amazing movie as you have ever witness,Positive

Inception in no matter how many rewatches I attempt never fails to blow my entire mind By now i of course know the story and twists pretty well but I LOVE how much is still left up for interpretation and can have you view the entire film differently from all the previous watches Nothing short of astonishing and incredible visuals that create some awesome dreams after watching if you dont get spooked easy,Positive
"After ten years I watched this movie again I wanted to see whether my thoughts will change or not because ten years ago I did not understand why this movie is at the top Still I think it should not be even in top  movies because nothing is special Years are passing just like a moment I could not feel his pain or hope In one scene he wants something than bum it is happening Again for one scene his situation is so bad than guess what happens After just  seconds he is good So you never go top or down during this movie My suggestion is it is better to watch this movie without the number  expectations

This movie is certainly unique Great castconcept and story line The best part is that the director explains his idea brilliantly rather than making it confusing and difficult for the viewers,Positive
This Movie for sure made me see batman in a different light after all he is a human and has no super powers but it just shows that you dont need super powers to be a super hero I really liked the action in this particular film compared to the other batman films Christan Bale did a great job as batman and is possibly my preferred batman overall in the batman series Pretty soon the new batman vs Superman will be coming out although I myself am not really a DC fan I am definitely going to be seeing that after I watch Marvels Captain America World At War maybe after seeing Batman VS Superman I may convert into a DC fan and after seeing pictures of the movie that is a very likely chance,Positive
Its an absolute wowPainfully cheesy repetitive as the drumming of a woodpecker script recycled from a hundred movies before and once again over the toppish CGI How many old and new monsters can you cram in Just about as many as old and new actors to awoke that fuzzy warm feeling you had when first watching Jurassic Park three decennials agoCould I conjure up anything good here I kind of like that Malcolm character and Jeffie does him quite well but its just not near enoughIt took absolute determination to get through the whole movie without putting it on x Man Hollywood is reaching new lows by the number,Notr

I cant imagine how much the actors mustve been paid to have this in their resume From Swift to Elba JHud to Rebel Wilson Judy Dench even No amount of acting talent could save this sorry excuse for a selfindulgent furry fantasy,Negative
Terrible plot unfunny and James CordenNeed I say moreWell according to IMDB I do A minimum of  characters in factSo finally let me recommend that you avoid it Having said that my children have watched it twice I have no idea why,Negative
Plenty of action some impressive sequences and fun unlike JP Fallen Kingdom which was just miserable If youre expecting high art when has JP ever been that youll be disappointed but if youve plenty of popcorn and are out for an evening without having to think too much its good value entertainment,Notr
Wow its probably one of the ugliest movies I ever seen You can tell the most of the actors tried their best but the whole movie just was so disgusting looking,Negative
While the movie was lacking in  several aspects of the anime I was surprised how well it turned out I was even surprised I managed to get goose bumps during certain parts Perhaps it was because like the anime it got to the point a little quicker Dont get me wrong I appreciated that in the anime however they did have to squeeze a whole saga into roughly two hours that impressed me Overall the movie could use more as for what that more is who knows I agree that Goku looked nothing like I expected him to Wishing for moreI did like that they tried to add every aspect of the anime keynote TRIED A for effortby the way  the end scene was lame,Negative
Come on guys According to the IMDb Top  THIS is the second best film EVER Better than Citizen Kane Better than Godfather Part II Better than ALMOST EVERYTHINGNo its a very very long very very predictable very very cliched very very oldfashioned and sentimental film blessed by some good performers especially James Whitmore who alas does not figure prominently enoughIt worries me that many of the comments  here seem to think the film artistically transcends the usual Hollywood fare when in actual fact it wallows in all the conventions of its genreI give it  mainly because I like Tim Robbins and Morgan FreemanThe only people who could mistake this for a Great Film would be those who mistake the works of Stephen King for Great Literature,Positive
Worst movie Ive seen in  so far and I watched Good Boys Horrible casting Horrible choreography Horrible cinematography and HORRENDOUS CGI Whatever musical this was based on was a horrible second Jason Derulo and Rebel Wilson somehow managed to make this gruesome movie even worse than what it already was If its not a Disney musical dont make it Aladdin was bad enough Thank you for your time,Negative
I dont see why this movie gets so much hate It is a bit of a rehash of old ideas but it was always intended to wrap up the story There were multiple story lines in different locations including the Mediterranean The movie went in a positive direction with a message about coexistence which is a different take from the previous movies The dinosaurs were stunning as always The movie also had a lot of likable characters who made a lot of sacrifices to do what they think was right I suppose people were expecting an apocalypse movie Instead it made me wonder if we should bring back extinct creatures and give them a chance in the wild in real life,Notr
I cant believe how people are giving this such terrible reviews Its a cartoon It was not supposed to be a highly acclaimed film or some great hitIts fun to watch and has a good story line and great visuals Sure besides using emojis the plot may be less unique but it was still a fun watch for day when you have nothing else to do Most people giving this a  star review are being dramatic and overcritical especially given that Ive seen much worse movies in the theaters that ended up with  or  stars on IMBD Also please ignore the star reviews from trolls who are trying to be funnyBottom line Dont expect an instant classic and you will enjoy this Give it a shot,Negative
Look at your cats litter box for hours and thats more interesting than this dumpster fire shame on you Hollywood,Negative
This movie is high energy but the problem with that is that it never stops There is no contrast to it High tension the entire time No release and it wears out quickly to the point you dont even want to finish watching it Too much repetition was included in this movie Action sequences were too long and added nothing to the story It needed a film editor to cut about an hour of it just to make it watchableThen there is the plot A plot which was thinning wrapped around all the action and special effects You got the feeling that you were watching a computer video game and not an actual story Far too much distraction and time spent on the lead characters personal life problem and he trying to deal with it,Positive
Not the very beginning but about  minutes or so into the movie I didnt know what to think I felt like a lot was left out and I was going to be pretty confused But it picked up very fast and got to the main part making the rest of the movie pretty much perfect in my eyes The excitement was just too intense at parts The suspense had me at the edge of my seat at times wondering what I was going to see next The ending was one of the best parts Watch and you will see The writers really had something going here The ability to control yours and others dreams To bring a team into someones mind and help control their dream The ability to make a dream within a dream This really was written by great minds and Nolan really directed it well The movie is just shy of  and a half hours but it doesnt really seem like it because you will enjoy this film The cast was excellent Leonardo DiCaprio was great Ellen Page was also a great second Cillian Murphy stayed more quiet but still could act My medal of great acting has to go to Joseph GordonLevitt Never thought I would see him in such a fighting type role but it really fit for him Unfortunately Tom Berenger gets the award for not acting as well I think he is just getting too old maybe This movie has some great action shots and the CG is pretty good too Pure suspense from start to finish Great film great cast great writing,Positive
Blew my mind when I watched it and still blows my mind nowRidiculously clever and entertainingHalf the time you are just mesmerised on one hand I wish more movies could be like Inception on the other hand Im glad they arent so we can appreciate a stunner when it comes alongDont take my word for itwatch it,Positive
Feels like a school team project where everyone did their part at home and then the team leader assembled the pieces one hour before the deadline there was just too much people too little dinosaurs and lots of unfinished stories a very sad way to end a sagathe only fun part were the callbacks to the original movieFirst time reviewing a movie ,Notr
After this movie I know longer see cats the same way,Negative
All the reviews I read before this movie had me worried After seeing this in the RPXIMAX theatre I cannot believe how bad this movie was rated If you are a fan of marvel especially comics this movie is well worth the timemoney investment The post credit scenes make you leave the theatre wanting more Awesome experience,Notr
"When I saw it for the first time  years ago I had to sit for a while and think what did I just see there After watching it many times seeing more and more how great it is each time I now believe that it is the greatest movie of all time Everything about it from the music to the acting is just fantastic cinematography amazing how the movie was conceived and made a reality pulling all the different parts together perfectly was just an impossible task It takes you to the edge of your own subconscious and brings us back so we can be young men again
Conceptually one of the best movies out Its one of those movies where the movie mystically connects to some part of actual life while conveying the message in a supernatural way Its also one of those where you learn or realise something new every time you watch it",Positive
IMDb perhaps you should increase your rating scale to  since the release of this movie A longtime Christopher Nolan fan I was expecting this film to be better than I could imagine It was Far betterKeeping this simple Inception may very well be the best movie I have ever seenSeeing it on the Big Screen was an intense experience and I hesitate recommending it to anyone who may become ill from intense action sequencesIf you are not one of these people and have not yet seen this movie then I pity you for not having seen it YET PS If you have never heard of Christopher Nolan please for the love of god search his name on this website and watch his other movies he has actually made more great films in addition to the one Heath Ledger died shortly after making PSS To those who say Inception is not an original idea DUH Saying Inception is a remake of Paprika is preposterous Do you really think that  was the first time anyone had an idea like this Its called execution,Positive
I actually kind of liked this movie I cant say its the new Shrek or something like that but it was kind of nice The story was clear and easy to understand Its childsafe and it has some easter eggs in it Par example the chase in Shrek with that dragon that gets entangled in her own chains I always enjoy it when people put easter eggs like that in their movie So this is my conclusion if youre ill and too tired to watch more complicated movies this is kind of nice Just keep a vomit bucket with you for during the ending scene That scene was just too sweet,Negative
A not very funny and too long film the script does not shine and the characters neither A big wasted opportunity a mediocre short film Jurrrasic World disappointment,Notr
Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight is not just a superhero film it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality chaos and the human conditionThe film masterfully balances action with deep character development showcasing Batmans struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons The performances are nothing short of extraordinary particularly Heath Ledgers iconic portrayal of the Joker which redefines the archetype of the villain Ledgers Joker is chilling and chaotic serving as the perfect foil to Batmans quest for justiceNolans direction is taut crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats The screenplay is sharp blending intense action sequences with thoughtprovoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantismThe cinematography and score further elevate the film with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story Each frame is meticulously crafted contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gothams dark underbellyOverall The Dark Knight is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll A true triumph in cinematic storytelling,Positive
Ok let me start saying this is not an all bad movie but it doesnt feel any like the previous Matrix franchise Not the acting not the script not the enviroment nothing seems really in the right spot And one of the bigger problems if not the biggest Keanu is not Neo anymore there is zero percent chance you see him and not relate him to John Wick,Notr
I generally do not write reviews but this movie was worst I have seen in recent timesScreenplay was like loose motionActors were like randomly called to do shots and go away no link in what they want to achieveSeems they just wanted to bring all the character and do birthday celebration,Notr
The only negative I could give this movie is that the protagonist overshadows the main role of hero After all it is a batman movie But lets face it of all the good actors in the movie Heath Ledger blows everyone away with his role of the joker Not just for this movie but this may be one of the best acting roles in history The performance of his life  no pun intended  Its a shame he died there were more great performances in him sadly we will never see It would be a reasonable supposition to believe that ledgers performance may have been so extreme and brilliant due to psychological issues he was experiencing at the time which ultimately took his life A candle burning too bright and will be missed,Positive
Not worth your time or money This was completely boring the entire time and is only interesting in its appalling imagery My friends and I saw it just to make fun of it and it wasnt even fun to do that Hopefully this movie is forgotten forever,Negative
This is the most disgusting movie I have ever watched,Negative
I didnt like this movie as much as the previous ones Pratt who is supposed to be the main guy doesnt get as much air time as other boring characters Claires facial expressions were very good It was good to see some old characters but I kept wanting to see Pratt more And I hate all this girl is the key to everything crap The black actress was an interesting character The chase scenes were the only really enjoyable parts But unfortunately once again the character writing is bad as with other Hollywood movies But at least it wasnt as woke as other movies,Notr
The greatest movie ever made Period Pure and simple it is what every director hope to achieve The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it meansIt will bring tears to your eyes It will make you think how you have lived your life so faror in fact how you have wasted it It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely The performances are simply mind boggling be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a directorIf you havent already seen it please do otherwise you are missing something,Positive
This movie is just god awful its boring and the cgi is just pathetic i would rather burn in the deepest circle of hell for eternity than watch this movie one more time god if you want something actually entertaining read the reviews on this movie because theyre worlds better than this movie i am contemplating receiving surgery now to remove my eyes because of this movie,Negative
Weve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight Weve seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movieEverything thats been said is pretty much spot on This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hypeFor as much action as there is in this movie its the acting that makes it a great piece of work Between all the punches explosions and stuntwork is some great dialog work All the actors have their momentsBales Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film Martial arts skills cunning great tactical thinking forensic application technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Foxs inventionstechnological breakthroughs intimidating personality and even a little swashbuckling As for Heath yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character Its not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions The Jokers stance on chaos order anarchy the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance couldve pulled something like this off Thats how difficult of a role this was and thats why Ledgers performance is so greatThis isnt an action movie Its a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain as well as order and anarchy Yes listen to the dialog because its all in there,Positive
I dont know why everybody hates it I will agree the movie isnt as much about dinosaurs as it should be and its more about that girl but I still enjoyed it Its nothing special but still a good entertaining movie,Notr
A perfectly made movie with Heath Ledger at his best Batman Begins started the trend of darkserious movies and just when you thought a movie couldnt be better The Dark Knight came out with an outstanding performance by Heath LedgerAs much as you hate the Joker character in the movie in the end you truly feel bad Every scene hes in gets so intense with your eyes glued to the TV its really hard to get side tracked by thinking of something elseSadly The Dark Knight Rises wasnt that great this movie still stands as one of the best movies out there,Positive
This movie is very stale predictable and undeniably boringEven though I have not really seen a movie like this before I feel like ive watched it a billion times before it is so increadibly predictable from the first  minutes of watching ou already know whats gonna happen Past thirty minutes the movie is just so boring The only quarter decent thing about this movie is the fight scenes which still look like they were choreographed by a five year old who just finished watching the matrix,Notr
The director is a real genius The point is hes young This is a film that is close to perfect in every detail from the writers to the actors from the cinematography to the score,Positive
Very strong computer work and d Nice attractive theme of  cats But it is very boring Too musical No catchy story No meaningful plot Waste of time and money I wish if the producers took a good advantage of the cat Theme with a comedy or inspirational movie,Negative
I had the impression I was watching a fusion of Sense and Matrix the atmosphere the music reminded me of the series and the acting was ok not worth a movie like The Matrix Disappointed I wish I could unseen what I saw,Notr

I dont know how successful the MCU era is that they are willing to make a movie that costs nearly  million dollars and has such bad quality If Morbius wasnt a Marvel character in the MCU era I dont think many people would have paid to see the movie if they knew it was this bad We get to see a few CGI fight scenes and while the color scheme of most of the important scenes is too dark and hard to see I found myself unimpressed by the fake smoke that billows behind Morbius and Milo Wheres that smoke coming from Is something burning A movie with a shallow story and lifeless dialogue disconnected scenes bland characters and no message Look at Jareds expression he looks too naive and innocent for this role Maybe he should have focused on changing the muscles in his face instead of his body I dont know what Vulture is here for but from the trailer he seems to be a bait to get money from people,Notr
I personally loved the trilogies Theyre my alltime favorites But the story in this movie was the convoluted mess Ive ever laid eyes on The characters were poorly executed and had no substance The plot direction left kept me askingis this really it What was Lana Wakowski thinking This felt more like a cash grab than anything and was a huge disappointment to the Matrix fan base out there Either you need to fix this or leave it beplease,Notr

To be fair the movie may be a bit hard to follow without any prior knowledge or for those who struggle with information overloads However i found it an excellent film that kept me thinking and engaged Few movies are this engaging as many feel like you well are watching a film With Inception you feel immersed in the filmIt is definitely a very thought provoking film and was very well shot One of the best movies ever made if I must say It is an extremely clever film with an fairly original plot The entire idea of dreams within dreams is fascinating and exciting as well,Positive
This is definitely one of my favorite movies  it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once  Tim Robbins you make my days a little brighter  thank you,Positive
The movie did not disappoint I love comic characters I did not know much about morbius so I liked learning his origin story The plot made sense and there was lots of action I like the cgi effects The way the character transformed and flew was very bat like I also liked the way the bats responded to morbius The actors were believable I dont know why the movie has been given low ratings Wonder Woman  and the Eternals were much worse This is a great movie if you like fantasy If you wait until the credits run there are two previewswhich makes me wish for a sequel I think you should give it a chance,Notr
Akiko Glitter Christina Aguilera Flamenca Sofia Vergara are the only good things in this movie it looks great but that is it no laughs bad script not much I can say Not even kids will like this or anyone who is not into tech or is into tech will find it offensive I saw this to kill some time and just to see Akiko Glitter,Negative
Tom Hopper has become the most snobbish filmmaker with an Oscar He now makes films that sound like people pleasers and sure things when the cinema is about emotion and guts Dont adapt Broadway musicals read Andr Bazin or take a page from Damien Chizelles book This remake tendencies that we are seeing suck if you really have something to say or do with an adaptation do it but dont rip it off and prentend well enjoy it like the real thing not even if you cast Taylor Swift or Jason Derulo ps BS,Negative
Im not really sure on the below really low ratings but it kept me watching Felt the pace was good and decent enough action also the change in to a vampire was also really goodNot really sure what was missing maybe story could of been better but I liked the horror element of the movie but story could of been done better overall wasnt bad,Notr
I can honestly say this movie made me appreciate the manga I love it but only got into it to impress a boy in my teen years Seeing this god awful movie which I knew would be bad who DIDNT know I want to go back and read the entire series just to wash it out of my brain It feels like they pushed and pushed this movie back and like a school child who doesnt want to flunk by not turning in their project they just threw together something and threw it out there hoping for participation points They encompassed so much into the one movie that they had to leave out all the characters How can you create Goku with no tail and a liking for girls As my husband said Goku thought marriage was something to eat They wanted this movie to appeal to the consumer like every romantic comedy Disney channel production that is processed in Hollywood God Bless the manga,Negative
The cgi was ok and even taylor swift and ian mckellan wasnt enough to safe this lack luster story about  cats that wanted to be reborn with one of their  lives but only one can be chosen I was unhappy the whole time in the movie except when it ended do not pay to see this,Negative
I blame this movie for causing I truly feel bad for those who paid to see this film Thats money that could have been used to start a dumpster fire Which you could then film release and get better reviews,Negative
This is just an all out disgrace I cant believe they did this to something that I loved to watch as a kid Listen this movie is so bad Id rather watch the Ben  madefortv movie with my son  times straight before I watch this movie again and thats saying something Not only is it a disgrace to Akira Toriyama and his wonderful Dragonball universe its a really bad movie Everything about it was off It shouldnt even have been called Dragonball These dragonballs sure do stink real bad and collecting em all couldnt create a wish big or good enough to fix this Unless they remade this movie with A LOT MORE MONEY at least  hours long good director better casting ratedR or at least pg rating better fighting better storyline better dialog Effin everything that would make a movie stand out theres no way Hollywood should ever touch this or any other classic anime If Gatchaman or Ninja Scroll are anything like this movie when they come out I will definitely blow,Negative
Every matrix simulation had a version covered by some delightful philosophy which tries to enslave humanity in different waysVersion in this movie had a really good idea whereas it got mentioned only IN A SINGLE FREAKING SENTENCE Its not in the atmosphere not anywhereIts clear that directors choose the path of creating CGI that is worse than any Marvel movie instead of showing humanitys interaction with desireSHAME,Notr
Some of these reviews I cant seem to fathom or understand I just watch the movie and I seemed to have enjoyed it I wasnt expecting it as most were I was surprised with how the director and writers of the movie were gathering most of the past Jurassic park characters together That was fun to watch However what I was disinterested about was the fact that the movie took nearly an hour to build up its action which was half of its timing However that wasnt much of a bug for me Nonetheless it was a fun ride and overall it was a decent movie Dont listen to some of these reviews You enjoy it,Notr
There are only a few words I have to say Every time I watch that film I have to cry There are not many films which get this result Must have something to do with the direction of Frank Darabont And the acting of the stars is just brilliant As a matter of fact I dont see Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins playing just another role I only see two Persons Andy and Red For a long time I had the problem that when I saw Tim Robbins in another movie I thought of Andy Dufresne But now I will write something about the story Of course I have read the original story written by Stephen King It was in a way different It has not that deep meaning that is perceptible in the movie When I think about this friendship between the two men The sentence Get busy livin or get busy dyin well in a way it shaped my whole live This is definitely the best film I have ever seen,Positive

This is not the stage show It is a musical film with singing cats If you do not like the sound of this why would you want t see itOn the other hand if you want to see some well choreographed and well filmed dance sequences with fantastic songs you are in for an entertaining couple of hoursThe film looks good and the humanesqe faces on the cats does wonders in expressing emotion The cast is generally excellent and their enthusiasm helps invest in the charactersThere are some misssteps along the way Interrupting some of the songs disrupts the rhythm Some of the SFX dont work well and a couple of sequences dont work to wellCats succeeds non the less in being highly entertaining and memorable,Negative
I had a high expectations to see this movie but I was highly disappointed its crap laggy and its not amazing as it should looks too much dramas and Piccolo looks more like a power rangers villain haters of dragon ball z will surely enjoy it or those who doesnt like animes,Negative
Was a great Movie  I love the story and the actors were fantastic There is so much to say about this movie But look seriously look and say it is not a great movie from beginning to end Of course a good soundtrack also makes a great movie so the soundtrack also has to be mentioned The Movie Picture is very good good angles of shooting always transmitting us the space inside the prison or rather the space that we have not And finally check out this great movie they repented and were left with a better perspective for life See the movie enjoy and learn To finish just saying that it as a great movie oh wait i already said that no problem its to highlight the idea,Positive

The sheer brilliance of this film cannot be described in words The Nolan brothers have delivered one of the most riveting and powerful scripts in recent times with lot of technical panache This is a film that never lets go of its momentum right from the beginning and holds your attention till the most morally complex climax in a summer movieDo not treat this film as a superhero or a vigilante story It has lot more going for it For instance one of the many Aces in the movie is the Joker  heath ledger He owns every scene that he is in and it was good to see the rest of cast let him grab the center stage whenever he is on screen The actor has set a tough benchmark with this role and he will be remembered for years to comeThe Dark Knight is as much a showcase of action set pieces as it is a classic story between good and evil and what happens when lines are crossed on both the sides to achieve their respective motivesBatman is a hero not because of the stunts that he performs or the fights he engages himself in but because the sacrifices he makes for the city he believes in This is beautifully depicted in this movie and we feel for him when the movie reaches its pinnacleThere are lots of positives one can see within this  hour plus epicIn simple words It is a  on  and must see,Positive
All I could manage to say as I left the theater was That was awesome This is one of the best movies I have ever seen From the story to the acting to the action there wasnt anything lacking from this film There are so many layers not only in the plot but in the depth of story telling that go on in this film I dont know how he fit so much story into a couple of hours and still it can make perfect sense This is a movie you can watch  times and I probably will and still catch something you didnt see before It was so easy to get caught up and forget you were in a theater and not actually in the room with the characters I cant remember the last time I was so immersed in a film I actually had to remind myself occasionally that it was only a movie I loved everything about this The action sequences were just amazing I dont think these things have ever been done in film before It was like watching a perfectly done live action video game The mind twisting story keeps you guessing till the end and even after There was even a tragic but heart warming love story in the middle To fit all of this into a film is just incredible My advice to anyone is to find the biggest screen in a theater you can and go see this movie I dont even think an IMax screen is big enough for this gnarly piece of cinema,Positive
I have never seen any of the TV series but I thought that this movie wasnt very good In my opinion they kept repeating the same thing over and over getting very annoying The movie didnt really expand on the story line and didnt have very much about it Unless theyd advanced on the story line the movie shouldnt have been as long as it was because it just dragged on Many people may disagree with me but that is just my opinion I thought the movie did have potential and opportunities but it was almost like theyd turned down every chance they got to make it a movie worth seeing Unfortunately it is not a particularly great movie and I definitely wouldnt rush to see it again,Negative
Lol Im really not sure why this movie is so underrated I found it interesting maybe not really funny but some jokes were dark and not for kids which was kind of creepy but still the plot is nice The ending was also really good teaching everyone that you have to be yourself and dont pretend to be someone else Guilty pleasure Wasnt masterpiece but far away from bad movie,Negative
First of all you dont wait  yrs and not make a D iMax especially in this seriesThe movie itself this is typical  film industry garbage They make films so procedurally nowadays their is no creativity The young actors of course sucked as usual these days The visuals werent even as good as the first movie The story as usual nowadays it made absolutely no sense and didnt even add up A lot of this film didnt even mesh together This film has so much left leaning political agendas to it the casting makes that clear and I think maybe this film was supposed to be a comedy Idk idk what I watched it wasnt the matrix but Im not surprised its junk that is all our current generation produces And like everything made these days youre supposed to know outside information just watching itIm  and I have no hope for the filming industry anymore too much about making money and political agendas,Notr

There is never any really any sense of danger and the plot if you can call it that just quietly plays out One of the few movies I wish was shorterNot even the dinosaurs were as good as in the earlier installmentsIn the end its a sad waste of talented actors who combined with a little bit of nostalgia provide just enough to call it a movie,Notr
My expectations is high when I have heard the new part of matrix going to release So that feel full of excitement But when Im went to cinema I found nothing new nothing any twist nothing good action and not even new effects also Except Neo and trinity all others are new faces but thing is that no any improvised script It dissapoint for meBut yeah For a new audiences it would be new action scfiction flickAs an Indian audience good to see miss priyanka Chopra Thats all,Notr
All of the above This is amazing fetish driven furry clustermadness the word i wanted to use i cannot masquerading as a movie while being a furry play you should keep your kids away fromIf you as an adult decide to brave this amazing assault on humanity you may very well find it superbly gouging your brain out through your ears as you crawl in any direction seeking refuge from the brilliance of this productionThis epic blockbuster is basically when somebody makes a casting couch movie for furries and tries to market it to the masses as something anything other than that It is still a casting couch movie but without the couch or casting so it gets a family rating because kids love cats right right right people Aha Yes i dont think even furries liked it,Negative

Filled with characters and scenes to capture the nostalgia of Jurassic Park but failed to succeed in the general feeling of the original They couldnt even keep it in the same genre Dominion is a straight up action movie just with dinosaurs Its more reminiscent of a Mission Impossible movie than a Jurassic Park film The original was actually full of suspense and terror even a bit of gore In this there is really none of thatGrant Sattler and Malcolms return was the saving grace And actually making Dodgson the antagonist was pretty cool as well It was a showcase for some new dinosaurs but otherwise not much else going for itI will always love this franchise based on the original and how revolutionary it was in filmmaking Ive enjoyed the other films they look amazing and they have thoroughly entertained including this one But Im glad this is the end for now because the story telling has run its course and you can tell its exhausted Possibly in  years they could look at continuing it in some way but a very long break is needed,Notr
"Not nearly as bad as some people are making it out to be There is too much action and a lot of it is ridiculous There are too many characters and not all the performances are great The story is somehow both simple and complexBut this might is genuinely fun There are some cool dinosaurs new and old While some callbacks are a bit heavyhanded most are pretty light and enjoyable Big improvement from Fallen KingdomHeres the definitive ranking of the movies for reference

Terrible acting Horrendous and ridiculous story and hardly any dinosaursEvil Tim Cooks acting was so terrible it was laughableTotal mess of a final movie Skip this one,Notr
Ive always wanted to see a truly legendary terrible movie during its first theatrical run The Room wasnt given a theatrical debut in my country I was too young to go and see Gigli and I didnt get to go to the Baywatch either But now Ive done it I got to watch CG abominations vomit on Ray Winstone in a fursuit and that made me very happy,Negative
Im done No more Im sick of how people are saying that its good Its a notorious unwanted cringe worthy godforsaken movie that Sony ever made THEY CANCELLED POPEYE FOR THIS CRAP IM DONE I am sick of how people are saying that the emoji movie is good its not Cant you see the ratings and cringe in this movie Im done with Sony,Negative
I just cant believe how bad this movie is One of the lamest most pathetic banal and uninteresting movies Ive ever seen It couldnt be farther from the original Jurassic Park in any possible way The acting is quite bad everything is sooo predictable dinosaurs have almost no relevance to the plot but the worst thing is the amount of cheesy cheap good feelings the movie is packed with those murdering monsters being treated like pets What an incredible waste of money and time both theirs and mine,Notr
This film or may be masterpiece changed the whole outlook of mine towards life The characters played by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were so real and so closed to my heart that I cried and I laughed with them while watching it for the first timeWe learn from books we learn from our parents we learn from our friends and we learn from movie like The Shawshank RedemptionOnce upon a time I was going through a bad phase of my life and bit depressed also Then some suggested me to watch this What happened next was simply miracle The pain endured by Tim Robbins was no less than mine But it was hope that kept him alive That infused a new joy in my life and I achieved success in very little amount of time The dialogues are simply straight yet touchingThe movie has universal appeal  It can move anyone because characters played by Freeman and Robbins are so close to heartDouble thumbs up to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for teaming up and offering this life changing piece of cinemaThis movie was not made for Oscars although it grabbed multiple nominations and not for critics some critics ridicule about its number position in IMDb  It was made for common people like usHumble salute to all who were directly or indirectly associated with this all time classic,Positive

I saw this movie for the first time a year ago In those days I was browsing the IMDb when I saw this movie ranked  in the top  That was very weird for me because I never heard about The Shawshank Redemption before So I decided to go and rent it immediately After watching the movie I was positively surprised Definitely this is the best movie Ive ever seen The story the direction and the cast Specially Tim Morgan and Gil Bellows are perfect The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings This movie is a must see Thanks IMDb and all IMDb users for the top  and the wakeup call,Positive

I watch a LOT of movies this is by far the worst movie I have EVER seen This movie is packed with celeberities They should be ashamed of themselves and deny ever being in such a disaster The songs were boring The plot was non existent I couldnt stop thinking about how bad it was for hrs after watching it If someone gives you a free ticket still say no,Negative
When first time watch this movie i really not understand this what happening in entire movie after that i watch twice By the way its interesting movie who looking for some scifi movies the best past part of this movie that i like which is when character go inside brain and brainstorming to someone and find the clue i love that scene Its interesting movie but sometimes its hard to understand for me when i watch this first time but maybe its not to all like me I wait for its any second part if come i like scifi movies Must watch this movie if u looking for scifi action movie this movie for you,Positive
The only good part of this movie is when Goku said its Goking time and just absolutely goked Piccolo Holy cow I still have massive chills from that That here is truly one of the scenes in cinematic historyIn all seriousness the movies terrible I do NOT recommend thisThis is unfaithful to the excellent source material the character designs are inaccurate and looked awful Despite being a  million dollar budget film the costumes and well the visuals as a whole look absolutely terribleAnd dont get me started on the abilitiesExample AIR BENDING Im sorry is this Dragon Ball or The Last AirbenderWith all that said avoid this movie at ALL COSTSIf youve seen this movie I am so sorry and I hope you recover from the atrocity you have just witnessed,Negative

It was no where near as awful as the reviews would lead you to believe",Negative
From all the bad press and reviews I suspect that people were looking for more then it intended to be Seeing it for free on Netflix might have dampened the pain This is not an MCU movie Its trying to be one in the Underworld flair Maybe too much Underworld One of the problems is that Jared Leto cannot carry a movie He needs a stronger lead to work off of When he has that hes more than enough The subtlety of the effects works for me The bad guy Milo was a little too one dimensional and flat Predictable Weak writing in that regard Not enough character development I can see Morbius working in an ensemble MCU cast Hopefully he will be given that chance,Notr
Never saw the play but just saw the movie I was in shock Kept waiting to find out what the roar or meow was all about The tunes werenr catchy The lyrics werent clever and although Jennifer Hudson was good i thought Betty Buckley sang Memories like no one else It was like the Emperors new clothes No one wants to admit hes naked No on wants to admit that Cats sucks,Negative
It is amazing how grazy idea as invading dreams doesnt have plot holes Inception has great pacing and it doesnt have clichs You cant expect what is going to happen You can see that Nolan put his body and soul to this movieYou have to watch this movie multiple times to understand the total idea of this movie,Positive
Pros The second half of the film was really fun The OG cast was awesome The effects were goodCons The current cast got progressively worse as the film progressed The first half of the film was mainly nonsense and really dragged by The conclusion was honestly lame for a trilogy finaleAlso The Dilophosaurus still horrifies me like Im rewatching the original Jurassic ParkIve seen worse but definitely have seen better,Notr
Top Gun sequel took  or  steps up compared to the first while Dominion took  or  steps down There were a lot of action scenes that were OK to watch and some were actual fun to The problem is the story did not at all have the suspense of the first one It never drew you into the plot it just became too preachy Sad since it could have been good but it wasnt,Notr
Having seen the trailers for the past several weeks I was planning to see it but I was certainly not excited about it The next   hours flew by with a movie that entertained like a big budget movie and challenged the mind like a small indie flick As I tried to figure out exactly what happened which of course will be my opinion since this is the kind of movie that will be open to hundreds of interpretations I realized I needed to give it another look so I went back the next day and watched it again I noticed a few slight flaws the second time through but these were small details that can be rationalized depending on your point of view as to what the movie really was about Is this a all a dream Is it real and everything went as planned Are portions real and the end a dream There will be countless debate on this and we know Mr Nolan will never tell What I do know after this and the sensational Dark Knight I am now in the Christopher Nolan is far and away the most creative person in the film industry camp I strongly recommend to everyone  go see this and form your own conclusions  this movie does not preach but just entertains and challenges The best movie in years  nothing has been close,Positive
How do you take one of the most loved shows ever and utterly botch a live action adaptation so poorly I dont trust anyone that have this over  Star,Negative
Theres not much to say past the title I have for this Its a copy of better films it takes time to go over how to play games on your phone at the time the human characters are blank slates and the jokes are easily seen from a mile away I do believe there is a better version of the film that couldve been made if the people were given the time to flesh out the story better and if the studio wasnt constantly interfering with development Otherwise just avoid having your kids watch this in favor of something better they deserve it,Negative
Morpheus was a smart profound man who left the impression of a kung fu monk This new one is an antipathetic character that I wouldnt follow anywhere even if my own life depends on itThese new characters they did dont inspire and dont have that intellectual depth The only thing good about this film are the moments of fights CGI and of course its nice to see Niobe Trinity and NeoHowever when you get to The Merovingian Lambert Wilson speech or to The Analyst Patrick Haris you come back to IMDB and edit your rating from terrible to hm okHaha D The song from credits My God this modernday society killed everything This is embarrassing,Notr
Watching The Shawshank Redemption in K was an absolute treat and solidified why this movie is my alltime favourite The upgraded resolution brought the incredible cinematography to life making every scene even more immersive From the gritty textures of Shawshank Prison to the breathtaking final sequences the K format added a new depth that I hadnt experienced beforeThe story of course remains unmatched Andy Dufresnes journey of hope resilience and ultimate freedom is both heartwrenching and inspiring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver performances that feel timeless with Freemans narration still sending chills down my spineWhat struck me most in this rewatch was how brilliantly the themes of friendship and perseverance were woven into every moment Whether its Andys quiet determination or Reds heartfelt reflections the emotional weight of this film is undeniableIf you havent seen The Shawshank Redemption in K do yourself a favour and experience it in the highest quality possible Its more than a filmits a masterpiece that deserves to be cherished again and again This rewatch reminded me why its a cinematic classic that Ill never tire of revisiting,Positive

One of the best movies that i have ever seenIt truly transcends time and is an epic in all proportionsPeople just dont make movies like this anymore and this is one of my favorite movies of all time The movie is About Andy Dufranea banker who has been wrongfully acquitted of killing his wife in cold blood and send to shaw shank prisonthe movie shows the various hardships faced by Andy and how he does not give up hope and carries on with patience and finally becomes free the climax is absolutely spellbinding and will leave you aghastit is a truly great movie and i was aghast at finding out that this movie was a failure in the box officeBUT NOW ALMOST EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THIS MOVIE FOR WHAT IT TRULY IS  A MASTERPIECE OF STORYTELLING,Positive

When i see any upcoming NOLAN films i cannot hold my nerves togetherStarting from the sheer brilliance of MEMENTOTHE PRESTIGETHE DARK KNIGHT n all perhaps he is the most talented and thought innovative director in HollywoodIn other words unless u see a NOLAN film till the climax  u cantt predict its ending n thats what i like about himHe simply keeps puzzling the past and the present in perhaps the most thoughtful way Coming  the film its another gem of a work by Di Caprio after SHUTTER ISLANDN wen u have casting like MICHAEL CAINEELLEN PAGEJoseph GORDON LEVITT etc its surely a must watchI can assure u that u cantt even leave a single second while watching the filmIts a scifithriller directed by NOLANThat says it all Afterall YOUR MIND IS THE SCENE OF THE CRIME Frankly speaking a must watch movie without any doubt,Positive
Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize GothamMaggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent In the end this is Heath Ledgers movie He overpowers everybody His early death may have immortalized him but my opinion isnt inflated His presence is electric It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating Heath Ledger makes this movie great And it surpasses the series reboot Batman Begins,Positive
A film directed by Frank Darabont Starring Tim Robbins At first I was retissant but when I knew that in this film there was this sublime actor who is Morgan Freeman Anyone who spends time watching TV and watching movies should have seen this movie at least once in their lives It is a great sadness for me to learn that Morgan Freeman did not win the Oscar for this film,Positive
The cats movie is just mindless cringe worthy has no meaning and they rereleased it to make it seem better but it didnt help it made it worse Never come out with another movie like this again,Negative
Went to see cats without seeing the musical or knowing the story Not much if a story though Once you get over the actors being cats you can appreciate that is is a film with dancing and singing which is done very well Jennifer Hudson singing memory is outstanding she can bang out a tune I would say go see it with an open mind and you may well enjoy it,Negative
just read the title Tough I think its a pretty decent movie but not as good as the Stephen Kings novel i just cant understand why it should deserve to be ahead of everyone else in the top  with the exception of the godfather To be honest i dont even really think it should be in the top  Yeah I know you Americans love the happyending Vaselineflavored subtly homosexual jail movies but all this hype its too much anyway Come on this cant be better than Welles Kubrick Kurosawa or Scorsese or not even Carpenter and Fulci in my humble opinion So I give it a  This is not a critical valuation of the movie This is a political statement,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare films that transcends time genre and audience Even decades after its release it continues to resonate deeply with viewers across generations Set primarily within the rigid confines of a prison the film explores the human spirit in its most tested and vulnerable state yet it never feels heavy or depressing Instead it is quietly upliftingWhat makes this film exceptional is its storytelling The narrative unfolds patiently allowing the audience to truly connect with the characters and their journeys Rather than relying on dramatic twists or flashy moments the film builds its emotional strength through small meaningful details and powerful conversations Every scene feels purposeful contributing to the overall message without ever feeling rushed or unnecessary,Positive
This movie is not complicated This movie is not complex This movie is an excellently acted excuse to put the most astounding weaving together of action sequences ever performed on filmIts mindnumbingly beautiful and if you ever saw an action movie you liked this movie is close to perfection This movie is literally a movie that will make you edge forward on your cinema seat and if you feel you have outgrown action movies then this flick will make you  againThe actors are good and they close together the gaps in the action effectively and quickly The cutting is probably the finest I have ever seen and the music orchestrates the events perfectlySee it,Positive
This movie starts off really interesting but fails to go any deeper than lots of standard Hollywood crap like a really forced back story for the main character Characters lack depth and the most interesting part of the movie is its visual effects which are nowhere short of amazing Avatar level production However in a few couple of years these CGI effects will not be that impressive anymore and then people will hopefully see how lacking this movie is for a good story and characters The average moviegoer will love this movie but if you like good movies in the scifi genre you kind of expect at least some plot twists Still the movie is good and well made but not great It will most probably be forgotten in a couple of yearsIf you enjoy movies with action and CGI and want a movie to watch with friends go see this movie If you are looking for something truly originalstorywise then avoid this movie at all costs,Positive
This movie was the bestest movie i ever watched and it was very good the charaqtars were very good and it was not a spooky movie so that was veery good to,Negative
Ill grant that you have to be fairly intellectual to understand this movie but its a masterpiece nonethelessHeath Ledger is incredible probably the greatest acting performance ever from a single actorI feel like the intellectual part comes in when you try to understand the characters I have read other reviews saying that the joker made no sense but in truth the darker you think of him the more sense he makesPlotholes are also very easily filled when paying attention to the film,Positive
Ever since this movie came out Ive loved Batman Great story acting action and everything Love this movie more every time i watch it The music of course is amazing Hans Zimmer is the man Joker is still one of the best villains in cinematic history Im just writing this review so IMDb says ive written a review before So now Im just stalling to make this enough words Blah blah This movie is amazing but I already told you that Everyone has seen this movie and no one reads a reviews from a movie that came out in  If youre reading this youre a loser my grammar is so bad right now because Im writing so fast I just need  lines of text to finish my review,Positive
I went into this blind I really liked it They did pretty good with the effects I liked the tails and ears Jennifer Hudson Judi D and the Magic cat guy and the cat who played Victoria and the other main cat guy LOL I cant remember but I loved the whole cast Idris was just okay I am surprised ppl are giving such negative reviews JHud needs an award I want to go see the broadway play now With all that being said I still like dogs better,Negative
Good cast Good story The performances were excellent and there was both ample food for thought and some very good scenes Didnt hurt that im a big Morgan Freeman fan Always top notchOn the other hand overall the whole film was far too unpleasant preachy and downright repugnant to be terribly enjoyable When the payoff at the end finally arrived it just wasnt grand enough to overcome the feeling id just crawled through the sewerAnd for this to be the  film on IMDb actually second but same score as  and with more votes among far superior films like The Godfather Schindlers List Lord of the Rings and Casablanca is ludicrous This would never even have entered the remotest regions of my mind if somebody had asked me to name some really great films,Positive
This is such a good movie that even to this day many years after it came out I still cannot find a single person who does not like Shawshank redemption Everything in this film is timed well The story is excellent and flows with perfect timing and the editing between the sequences are great The acting is great and it keeps you interested from the first to the last frame It also has a very clever plot You are not  sure what Tim Robbins is up to and how he has escaped until much later Great job by everyone from director actors to script Just the best in movie making,Positive
Hey dont take my word for it it Its currently  stars on imdb The masses have spoken,Negative
This movie is only great because of Joker and Nolans direction Otherwise its a childish movie to me with lots of weak characters There are many flaws in it as a movie as welllike shawshank and godfather i saw it many times but couldnt appreciate it that muchits the rd best movie of all time I mean really Joker no doubt is absolutely brilliant and fairly deserved an oscar but what about the rest  He alone carries this movie along and others look petty and naive characters before him Symbolically there is a continuous fight between good and evil in this movie but its an old theme now,Positive
I am a teenager and Im disgusted The movie fails to fit teen demographic I did not like the jokes they are too corny and bad As a movie reviewer I tell the truth about the movie I thought that the Emoji Movie was complete crap The only thing I liked was the animation I thought the animation team did great The dialogue was very forced for genes parents The lesson of the story is like Wreck it Ralphs Lesson You can be yourself or something like that Overall please dont watch this movie,Negative
The only good thing about this movie and why I gave it  stars was because Keanu blessed us with his presence But even he could not save this film Im sure he was embarrassed by this utter master fail Carrie Ann Moss did as well as possible with what she was given to work withThis pathetic storyline makes no sense but depends on past movie scenes to attempt at making it somewhat relevant or enjoyableJadas acting is some of the worst Ive seen and that says a lot Her hunched over decrepit portrayal is laughable Why do casting agents still portray herAll I can say is save yourself some valuable time  do not watch mess,Notr
I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind At this writing this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made The SECOND BEST EVER MADEWhy This was my questionThe acting is good Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition But these are not truly great actors and in any case they are only asked to play appealing persons deliberately lessdimensional than real as opposed to believably hyperreal which is much harderThe director is a firsttimer and it shows There is simple framing and staging here In fact there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this filmThe story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow All the chunks are the same size with no fancy rhythm There is no distracting backstory No element has irony not writing acting shooting even the scoreNow for me I expect and demand art in my films  thats why I register this as plain But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense It is straight and honest people seem hungry for honesty and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right timeIs a film great because it merely fulfills I hope many people think not and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts,Positive
All around I found it to be a Really Creative and Clever take on the story and even an improvement in a few aspects like joining Martian and Piccolo into one characterI would have changed a few things though  the ending a tiny bit to make it more similar to DB I would have had them revive a dead Yamcha instead for example and not have the flying Goku by the end but a powerful well rooted KameHameHa instead  the whole concept of having Goku be the old minion of Piccolo makes no sense at all it would make Goku older than  year old and Gokus grandfather too It would have been better to have Piccolo explain that his old minion died but that Goku seems to be the same kind of monstrosity so that hell become the new minion of PiccoloI really enjoyed it anyway,Negative
Well to speak Christopher Nolans movie memento i saw some what quiet a long time ago i just came into the genre of unfolding events but it was an exceptional movie to watch and i said man i have to check out who is the maker of this film i was hoping for some biggie should be behind its making and then i came to know Christopher Nolan and for years he has done very less films and delivered us all his potential great movies to entertain the audienceAnd Now He Has done it again with another great movie inception such a remarkable movie you just get to know we have seen movies like the matrix and the talk about mind games movies but it is different from all others because Christopher Nolan has a different mind perception of all others who have tried a different acting is great and how the characters take you into it all you got to do is sit back keep your eyes and ears open and the rest will follow with you,Positive
This is one of my favourite films ever Why Well a lot of reasons really But mostly because of the plot It contains just about everything needed for a film to really work like art The actors are superb note Freeman  why he didnt receive an Oscar for this one Ill never understand The story is great and written by my all time favourite writer  Stephen King Misery Dolores Claiborne The Shining Carrie and more which are all among my absolute top films Try them out I promise you all several great moviemoments,Positive
Greatest Super Hero movie of all time One of the Top crime dramas of all time Greatest Heath Ledger performance Heath WILL win the Oscar just like the Golden Globe Nolan has MADE BatmanIf you didnt get a chance to see this in Imax when it was out now is the time with the rereleaseThis movie is amazing in ImaxThe opening scene is entirely in Imax and any time you see a city shot as well Also the great chase scenes are done in the ImaxThis must be up there with most reviewed films of all time but Hey Its that goodSeriously if you havent seen this by now SHAME ON YOU,Positive

The best superhero movie of them all Beats easily all of these new MCUmovies,Positive
its THAT good i actually bothered to review a film for the first time The concept is just fantastic so original The actors are brilliant the special effects are spectacularly mind bending The whole thing is a perfectly balanced roller coaster ride twisting and turning but not confusing action packed but not a gore show fast paced and yet containing enough philosophical themes to keep you talking and thinking for a long time I can safely say this is the best film Ive seen all yearGo and see it while its in the cinema Im pretty sure  of people who watch it will love it,Positive
Inception is what you get when a filmmaker knows how to merge style with substance Christopher Nolan has crafted a story not an original one but thats OK that takes slightly abstract ideas and places it in a reality you can almost grasp and then tells it with little complexity Its a movie for all the masses  and thats where Nolans genius comes inHe gives us characters many of them in fact and all performed expertly by the stellar cast The dreams all have their own architecture which is visually stunning And no its not redundant to say again that he managed to merge style with substanceInception is filled with special effects action running all over the place and loud dramatic scores Remember this is Nolan with a big budget But its also just a straightforward story with characters and romance  it does star Leonardo DiCaprio after all,Positive
There were sparks of entertainment but not enough to to keep my interest A few audience members walked out I struggled not to follow,Negative

Well I never write any review here but when I watched the  over  I was like what the hell I have watched this film like a  times since came out and I think is a good movie for children It contains values for them and its actually funny sometimes Maybe the Story doesnt make sense but came on its a movie to have fun and it deliver If you want to hang out with your children this is a good movie D,Negative
I love DBZ too and its hard to let go of the fact that there wont be anymore drawn by Akira Toriyama So we should be grateful that they are actually making a live action movie It may of sucked for some people but I think they did a good job considering it must be hard to actually pull offI think when Chi Chi and Goku settle down with Gohan then things will start to get better Piccolo will be Gohans mentor once Gohan survives six months in the wildness While in the wildness Gohan will have to defend himself against the Dinosaur just like on the anime Unexpectedly Gohan will transform into the Ozzoro leaving Piccolo no option but to destroy the moon or say goodbye to the earth The two Saiyan spacecrafts will crash land on earth  I think the graphics for this will be quite amazing Anyway I just look forward to see what theyll come up with,Negative

I am so happy to see this film top  in IMDb It deserves to be there The Shawshank Redemption appears in  I think this year was full of amazing pictures It lost Oscars but gained recognition This is a great story about friendship and redemption Frank Darabonts best movie for sure Andy Dufresne is one of the greatest characters ever made in the cinema art A guy who is innocent and get punished This film shows us that even our intention is a crime in a legal world No one is perfect and no one can predict anything We live by a scheme and trying to be fair People will always make mistakes and the greatest thing is to learn from them I am waiting for movies which can touch me like this one but after the year  nothing close to that appears There were great films about life and stuff but still its a modification a copy thereof what was before I think until the year  most of the valuable things in film art was told Its a little sad but this kind of art will always be deep in my heart as a lesson and beauty how fantastic picture man create I hope there will be at least couple movies in my short life that leave so many emotions like The Shawshank Redemption In XXI century it is a very hard thing to do I am patient and have positive thinking that cinema didnt say the last words,Positive
Fans of the Broadway musical will enjoy the film adaptation of Cats The film is beautifully choreographed well cast and gorgeously set The writers did a better job of explaining the storyline than the stage production If you hate musicals or are just watching Cats to hate on it maybe find something better to do with your time,Negative
Well as the other more than  review say it in my opinion this is the best movie created so far It basically just how life is you get punched in a face time to time but you have to stand up keep your hope and give value to your fellows because in return life takes care about your reward Oh yes and if you face any evil that you can stop do it This is the message of the film if we follow it life may be as rewarding ultimately for us as for the hero Other films that moved me like this Forrest Gump The curious case of Benjamin Button IMDb says I have to write another line in order for them to post my review so here it is xD,Positive
Watched this for the meme and it was so much worse than anticipated It was a slog to get through everything was dreadful apart from the colours and Sir Patrick Stewart,Negative
It may well have worked on stage but not on screen Self indulgent actors with too much cgi its comical but not funny,Negative
A couple of bests for this film the best King adaptation ahead of Misery and Stand by Me and in the conversation for one of the best films of all timeShawshank has stood the test of time since the sacrilegious Oscars debacle of  Two films should have beaten Forrest and it is line ball between Pulp Fiction and Andy Dufresnes epic prison sentenceRobbins and Freeman have never been better as Andy and Red whose nonsexual love story is the unique difference that sets the film apart from the usual prison movie clichesIt can be hokey too long by  minutes and perhaps even a bit preachy But it is incredibly well made and very entertaining ,Positive
In my opinion this movie a bit overhyped and a bit overrated actually Is this movie better than  Angry Men or Schindlers List or The Return Of The King Absoulutely not Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted This is a Nolan movie this cant be bad for real this is very good actually But Im saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II Its common Comic movies are overrated sometimes but this is overrated more with death of Heath Ledger I think it could be highest rated superhero movie Im truly okey with it Im just saying this should be on Top  not in Top ,Positive
 Well its based on Cats See I thought that by some stroke of genius the horrible source material would make something good Or at least so bad its good This is actually worse than the play,Negative
I honestly wanted to sink my head in the sand when this came out Please dont watch this Please dont I envy people who havent watched it yet Here we are right before us will be a generation of cancerous kids whos mentality is succumbed to The Emoji Movie This is a utter monstrosity Please I beg of you to spare yourself THE end is near,Negative
I only saw the trailer but it scarred me for life,Negative
I expected a pretty bad movie considering all the comments I had heard about the film I finally saw it today and I had a good time I laughed a lot and the movie is not that bad I was a bit disappointed when I saw the special effectsI have to say I expected a lot more The acting was decent Nothing out of the ordinary and the plot was OK although its kind of lazy sometimes If theres a sequel they should try with a new director Of course the cartoon is a lot better so if youre hoping to see a faithful adaptation of the cartoon into the big screen then youll be very disappointed Dragonball has a lot of potential they could really do Great movies with the story lines from the cartoonjust try a little harder,Negative
So amazing CGI dinosaurs is old stuff now Been there done that World Dominion is going for the nostalgic play by bringing back the original cast of the  Jurassic Park That was cool but somehow even with the original stars the old magic could not be restored The Francise has run its course and the way they left it does not sit right with me Dinosaurs have a right to live alongside us That seems terrifying and not a happy way to leave things I still give this movie a  due to exciting action scenes I often found I was tensing in suspense from the action And that is really what you come to expect from these movies good dinosaur action,Notr

The film is a classical thriller and like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and damngood clever concept To its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not The cast deliver well DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer GordonLevitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do Im not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesnt  pay attention Doesnt quite live up to the hype but it is still a very good and engaging film,Positive
"It is just what you want for the best movie Great story great acting thrilling twist
Just watched Joker in  I just has to come back and give dark knight a  And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs",Positive
I did my best to convince my  year old that one of the many other options at the cinema would be better to watch  but even Gru and his minions could prevent the horror I was to be consigned to  minutes of brain death whilst Im still a child at heart but so little to smile  let alone laugh at As I now know Hell does exist  there must be a God  As this movie is the work of the Devil  or a clever God who wants to recruit some more to his side ,Negative
Heath Ledger must have put everything at stack to prepare for this kind of act I love Christian Bale as an actor and Batman as a character but the after watching the movie must say sometimes its villain who steal the show,Positive
The worstweirdest episode of Shameless Wheres Frank,Negative
I thought it would never end Tedious and boring Such a shame I think perhaps they should stop making any movies in this series I lost interest very quickly,Notr
The reason this isnt a onestar review is because it has decent animation and its a good torture mechanism,Negative
I actually liked this movie It was almost exactly like the musical but with a few backstory things and more explanations I think the added stuff contributed well to it I really like the musical I know the cgi is strange in this but I didnt feel like it took away too much Overall a fun movie,Negative
Inception Is a masterpieceThe cast is perfect with Leonardo DiCaprio and actors like Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen Page who were amazingThe visual effects are outstanding The score composed by Hans Zimmer is perfect and syncs with the movieOverall this may be the best movie of Summer  This movie is a  Terms of film excellence,Positive
The Dark Knight was most definitely one of the better movies Ive had the pleasure of viewing and it did not fail to meet any preconceived notions or ideas which I formed already Everything from the phenomenal performance of the gifted set of actors to the amazing stunts and action executed was beautifully and concisely produced Starting with the actors and their performance I believe that Heath Ledger was the best Joker the Batman Universe has yet to see his expressed nuances and habits that he evokes to portray the Joker are something to be marveled In one of the most famous scenes of not just the movie but of cinematic history Heath Ledger poses the question to a mob leader while holding him at knife point Why so serious Heath Ledger was one of the best casting jobs of the movie Another good casting job of the movie is of Christian Bales He plays Bruce Wayne Batman in The Dark Knight and he brings the mystery and reclusiveness and charisma that he embodies as both personalities However while I sing praises of the movie thus far I dont feel as though it deserves a  of  as a score There is a little amount of movie material that can be considered worthy of such a score and The Dark Knight is no exception At some points in the movie the plot revolves more around the technology that has been developed and it would have been a better movie to explore and ascertain Bruce WaynesBatmans loyalty and moral character and how both characters find a growth of personal morality and justice,Positive
Relax Yes its not true to the cartoon but just because its not the same doesnt make it bad Enjoy it with your kids or just enjoy watching the silliness and action,Negative
Apparently the critics are having the avenger effect on all the movies They think that the entire superhero movie that will come out can be compared with Avenger and Spiderman no way home that forget the origins and the path that must be followed to reach that levelThe visual effects of the movies were incredible The story is basic the plot and the characters could be further developed but the director preferred to keep everything simple There are some gaps in the story of the movie As it progresses they explain it to you but you feel that some details are missing to give it a little more flavor in the climax moments of the movieJared leto was an incredible performance You cant ask for less from an excellent actor Despite the bad reviews they have of the famous places Morbius is a project that well worked can open schemes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe The Blade vs Morbius showdown would be unique in the CINEMA,Notr
I watched the movie  times and in many cases just for the soundtrack,Positive
Even though this movie is over  years old the message about friendship and not ever giving up will be relevant forever The lessons that the main characters teach us in the face of adversity are timeless This is also one movie that does not get old and I have watched Shawshank many times Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were spectacular in their performances They teach lessons that are extremely memorable and have quotes that you will never forget The one quote in the film that is a standout is Get busy living or get busy dying Who would not feel the impact of that quote This is one movie you have to have in your library and I am not one that usually buys DVDs This is a MUST SEE Dont miss this one and also keep a box of tissues nearby,Positive
Jared Letto is a chameleon He did a great job with the Joker and now with Morbius I am not a vampire fan but this movie was so well done it won me over Went with  other fanboys and we all give it a big thumbs up The story was one that hasnt been told before They didnt try to make the monster a hero like they did in VENOM They showed him with all his warts and evil desires The Keaton scene was confusing Overall a fun ride we all enjoyed Looking forward to the next chapter,Notr
This is a movie to be watched over and over  Each time I get a little bit more out of it  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have a great chemistry together  Many people do not realize that this movie was based on a Stephen King one of my favorite authors novel Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption especially since it is not of the horrorscifi genre I was really glad to see this one at the top of the list,Positive
The first time i read about this movie I was sure that this movie is overrated But after seeing him I am sure that this movie is underrated It is the best movie ever It is about hope passion love and friendship I do not think that Hollywood can produce an other movie like that it one in century The acting was GENIUS The script was the best ever The director was a maestro A lot of NovelMoivis not good as the novel I did not read Stephen Kings Novel but I am sure that the movie is much better believe me if you saw the movie you will not be able to forget it Believe me when I say that you will not able to talk after seeing the movie at least for  minutes and the first thing you will say Why this sons of bitches did not give it Best Motion Picture Well Forrest Gump won it  and I love this movie but believe they do not deserve it See the movie I am sure that this will change your view to the future to the hope and to the friendship,Positive
Before I saw this movie I wasnt sure if I was ever going to see something that I would consider perfect This is absolutely my favourite film of all time it has absolutely everything going for it The premise is incredibly smart and unique and is executed in a way that allows the viewer to discover things for themselves The cast is top notch in this movie with Leonardo Dicaprio the stand showing that he has true knowledge of this subject The rest of the cast does everything right and all have perfect chemistry with each other The heist itself was so well done and mad me fell as if I was in a dream and anything could go wrong at any time The heist gets more and more intense with every passing moment and the ending literally turned my mind against itself as I do this day am still trying to figure it out This made Christopher Nolan one of the greatest directors of all time and made a movie that I consider to be perfect,Positive
In the far western reaches of south west Wales I was lucky to be born to a father who had immaculate taste in film At the tender age of  when I started to understand the complexity of human emotion I was introduced to this beautiful film I remember the first time I sat and viewed the film my father put the VHS in the video player and left me alone to begin my relationship with this film from the age of  I reckon I must have watched this old film twice a year since and every time I still think this is probably the best film I have ever seenJust thought Id express a little of how I feel about this film hope you dont mindAl,Positive
This movie takes you through the life of some inmates of Shawshank prison A very moving storyOne of the best stories Ive had the pleasure of seeing in a long timeNormally I dont go out for these types of movies scificlassic horror fan This one really surprised me I actually didnt see it in the theater but caught it on TV then rented the movie Ive since bought it and have actually watched it a few times which is rare for me to do I usually watch a movie once then not again for at least  months to a yearThis movie will one day be a classic in my mindEnjoy,Positive
This has the feel of a Matrix movie But has a great balance of the old and new I believe the flash backs were great throughout the movie but adding new characters made this feel fresh,Notr
Christopher Nolan is one director who has never failed to deliver  his latest film Inception is no different With this he has created a monumental  thoroughly original piece of cinema that not only entertains but makes you think something that modern blockbusters have failed to do time  time again eg Avatar Transformers Clash Of The TitansLeonardo DiCaprio leads a sublime ensemble cast that includes some of todays biggest  brightest stars and a true legend in Michael Caine while Leo himself delivers arguably his greatest performance yetThe film looks  feels stunning The visuals are topnotch the film sounds suitably tense while Hanz Zimmers score only adds to the atmosphere The script is as you would expect brilliant remaining complex but relatively easy to follow  Nolan has once again stayed clear of conventional narrative to heighten the films complexitiesThis is a true original  just goes to show everyone that blockbusters can be intellectually challenging whilst remaining hugely enjoyable As a result one cant help but want more from a standout film in a year that surely has more to offer than it has produced thus far A new dimension of boundarybreaking has just been created by the new Kubrick  Hitchcock of film,Positive
I loved this movie I can literally watch it over and over again Heath Leger was the best Joker that has every been played I love the whole cast,Positive
I wish there was a score i could give lower than one Me and my friend were the only ones in the theater,Negative
The Emoji movie has to be the best film since Nativity  It showed how anything and everything can be loved At some points I could feel the tears rolling down my cheeks When I came out of the cinema I wish I could see it a billion more times so thats what I did Go see it with your family and friends Best film,Negative
Do not watch this movie watching this movie is a waste of time This movie is bad Why would you make a movie about Emojis Emojis are popular In fact I love them  But you shouldnt make a movie about them What is Sony Animation going to make next The Fidget Spinner Movie The Dab Movie The  AM Movie This movie is bad I cant even think of a better version of the Emoji Movie Rule  of Writing a Plot for a movie Never make a movie about something that you shouldnt make a movie about  How is this movie getting so much money,Negative
Sorry folks but can this film really be one of the greatest of all time Entertaining Yes Well acted Erryes  Life affirming No way Realistic Dont make me laughTwenty years or so pass in this film Does anybody get any older Apart from the occasional pair of specs thats it Not an extra wrinkle to be seen What happened to the makeup departmentPeople get beaten to within an inch of their lives One death and one wheelchair case but otherwise just a couple of bruises which disappear rapidlyThe baddies get their just deserts and were all supposed to shout serve them right as we say in England The goodies live happily ever after but we knew that would happen within the first ten minutes The people who think this is a great film probably think Stephen King is a great author Competent and popularyes Greatno PS Who replaced the poster after Was that an oak tree Maybe leaves are a different shape in America,Positive
Its pointless and poorly written to the point of senselessnessThe whole movie felt unnecessary and basically exists for woke points and ratconnation,Notr
This may sound a bit harsh on the movie There are a lot of big names But this is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life There is no plot Taylor Swift is only used as a promotion I dont like giving bad reviews But I have never used my life more stupidly than deciding to watch this film Do not waste your time on it,Negative

Heath Ledger will forever be the best joker ever and christian bale was a decent batman in my opinion,Positive
Absolutely terrible if i could chose one movie to wipe off the face of the earth it would be this piece of you get the point Anybody and i mean ANYBODY who appreciated dragon ball despises this movie and for good reason too its terrible The characters are not anything like the show vital things about everyone were changed AND BULMAS HAIR WASNT EVEN BLUE Even if you have never seen an episode of dragon ball z this movie would still be the worst one youd ever see The director was an absolute idiot and this piece of crap has forever scarred the name of Dragon Ball Our fan base has a saying nowadays A true DB fan respects ALL of the series but still hates Dragon Ball Evolution with a passion Do Not Watch This Movie,Negative
The best movie I saw until I think the likelihood of making a movie like this is very small,Positive

Lots of meaningless action Same old boring predictable near death experiences Feels like it was written so badly to make sure its the last one Script older than the dinosaurs Relying on the mix of actors to get bums on seats Id recommend not bothering to be one of them bums on seats,Notr
This movie is awesome What is everyone else talking about,Negative
This movie was fantastic super amazing highly recommend this to kids All the characters were very funny and charming Very adventurous also Watching this with the whole family would be a nice experience to Even my father enjoyed it I really like this movie so I give it  stars So please watch this incredible master piece with or without family,Negative
It is an OK movie I guess but this is not enough to justify its existence for me And I would have preferred more original ideas rather than a remake of all the iconic scenes from the first movieThe best part of the movie is that it makes me want to see the first Matrix again,Notr
I was very disappointed with this movie I made the error of watching it based on the high score it is recording in the reviews on the IMDb I could quite easily have given it away after  minutes but I persevered with itI only persevered for one reason I wanted to see what was probably Heath Ledgers last complete performance I rated his performance very highly and he deserves to be considered for any of the upcoming awards shows truly on meritI thought that Christian Bale was miscast and unconvincing as Batman and there really wasnt very much of a story line to the movie I cannot understand how this is rated a  out of  at present That must mean that all reviewers are between  and you are all giving it nine or ten Ten being the perfect score for the perfect movie I think some of you have let your emotions get away with youI scored it  out of ,Positive
MINOR SPOILERS AHEADThe story begins with the court case of Andy dufresne for the alleged murder of his wife and her lover the first few minutes at the start captivate you from the beginningAndy is wrongly convicted and sent to Shawshank maximum security prison set with a double life sentenceAndy finds a new companion called RedMorgan Freeman the man who can get things for anyone in the prison for the right price As a person that can get things or has been known to locate things from time to time for somebody Red doesnt find it particularly odd that andy asks him if he can get him Rita Hayworth in Of course he acceptsThe line that defines this great piece of cinema is get busy living or get busy dyingThis movie is without a doubt one of my favourites and remember always FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE,Positive
It was a great and a pleasant surprise to see that the movie that I chose almost five years ago as my favorite movie of all time is the number one on the list Although its my favorite my choice was based mostly on my personal reaction toward this movie and I did not expect that there are so many people that feel the same way I do about it I love every single thing about this movie every single shot And believe me I know what Im talking about because its the only movie that Ive seen so many times and it never failed to amaze meA great story based on Steven Kings novella great direction by Frank Darabont and great acting by Tim Robbin and Morgan Freeman Not to mention music and the truly original and always inventive dialogue Every body who commented here on this movie probably mentioned all the obvious great things about it I would like to add one thing that made this movie even more spectacular to me The movie contains scenes that present a complete idea that stand and work on its own Like the scene when Andy plays Mozart or the scene on the roof Critics might choose others but theres no other movie touched my soul like this one and Ive seen thousands of them Remember Hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies,Positive
I was really hoping it was going to be as good as I imagined and then i saw it  matt smith as a baddie EPIC FAIL the way he played the character just didnt work for me  cant fault his Dr Who  the CGI or whatever it was  is horrendous as you can tell when it switches between real and CGI for some reason it just looked bad  i just watched it hoping it would get better and the ending during the credits i just wouldnt put the two together not in any reality i remind you this is my personal view of what I watched dont let this put you off  you might like it,Notr
Before watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time I really didnt think much of it I thought it had probably wrongfully earned the  spot here on IMDb and couldnt be better than The Godfather for example A movie that was cool to like if you will I could imagine fashion conscious moviehipsters discussing movies over their glasses of Napa Valley Chardonnay arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the most and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical messages You get the ideaIm sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made has been said better in one of the other comments That said the reason Im posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isnt only a hardcore movie freaks wet dream While its brilliantly written has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the fantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont you really dont have to be an expert of film theory to appreciate it It appeals to so many different groups of people and so many different human feelings at the same time The weaknesses it had as it came out the idea of a jail movie not being compatible with the female population and the idea of a movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible with the male population is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption is loved by nearly all It offers something for everyoneIn my opinion rating something  is a bit too absolute for anything but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing and my first  I think Ill let it slide this time,Positive
Dom Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio is a skilled thief the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable Cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever lovedNow Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossibleinception Instead of the perfect heist Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one If they succeed it could be the perfect crime But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming Inception ,Positive

Probably the greatest thing that has ever happened to anyone ever in the entire history of everything has happened when the lights went down and the curtain came up on this film I dont want to spoil this for you but I am certain that whoever you are and whoever you take with you or not this is the greatest film ever made My one wish my only wish is that they will make  more just like it because I could watch this until I die In fact please bury me with a copy because it is super cool fantastic YEAH awesome greatThe plot involvesah ha No spoilers Its EMOJI tactic Its a feast for the eyes Its music to the ears If it were some sort of smoothie it would taste great It would smell like those candles that smell nice I would feel like butter that has just melted but isnt all the way gooeyspreadable YesAh emoji Lol,Negative
No words Just awesome Every thing in the movie is lovable Acting  And omg the screenplay  the idea was just awesome Just loved it Fav movie ever,Positive
Superb production values great performances and mesmerizing dance routines but the lack of story and weak editing spoil it Theres a great variety of songs and types of music but the way they join together results in a jumbled mishmash of genres and styles which is further exacerbated by the nonsensical lyrics The acting and celebrity performances are good but they are a bit jarring at times and although its a very magical and impressive production I was a bit bored by the end,Negative
This movie is annoying in several ways  The criminals are all goodhearted thoughtful sensitive guys while the guards and warden are the REAL bad guys  gimme a break  What is this  Dukes of Hazard which was far better than this  Further the plot is so so so predicable  Good guy outsmarts the bad guys and real justice is served spare me  I know a lot of people love this flick but in my humble opinion it is a big waste of time,Positive
Inception is the th film from Christopher Nolan and grapples with concept of dreams and the power of the human mind It is a spectacle of visual engineering and sound design while maintaining a deep and full bodied story The emotional aspect dreams and reality will stick with you long after you have finished watching It is no wonder that Nolan spent  years writing Inception,Positive
Not much to say that hasnt been said Great acting character development and plot Its the ultimate story of overcoming adversity Movies like this arent made anymore and it is saddening,Positive
"If you would like to watch an hour and a half long commercial then this is the movie for you The entire film revolves around these brand deals they were able to acquire such as Candy Crush Just Dance and Spotify Even if it doesnt make sense for the plot and what is happening for these brand deals to be brought in to the movie they are still included Its like watching a YouTube video with mid roll ads that interrupt the video
The plot itself is very common and not nearly as different or interesting enough as many other films with this format The characters are bland and forgettable since they are literally the same characters as your regular outcast hero characters If you want to see a good version of this film watch Wreck It Ralph While that film isnt the exact same as this it is quite similar and much more intriguing and interesting I cant even think of a single thing I liked about this film thats just how bad it was",Negative
Look I was excited The opening scenes were promising and it started really good But as it went on the characters and plot were SO predictable and BORING The lines were boring the costumes were boring the cgi was actually pretty cool but everything else was so boring Now usually a good soundtrack redeems a movie but this one didnt Ugh Anyway I fell asleep in the last  minutes and missed the whole climax of the movie but I could have guessed what happened it was that predictable so no big deal The post credit scene saved the movie although a little confusing fits the theme though If you liked Twilight or What Is It Like To Be a Bat by Nagel youll enjoy this slightly more,Notr
The Shawshank Redemption has great performances extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax One of the best dramas of all time,Positive
What an abomination Not a single scene that doesnt have a problem or contradiction with logical flow Hurt to watch until giving up after  mins in,Notr
It was so bad that I dont have words to discribe it Never watch if you dont want to compromise your memory about old MatrixEvery single moment is stupid and not logical,Notr
Ten Thumbs Up if I had them Incredible story incredible cast I would rate this as probably the best film I have ever seen and I have probably seen it a hundred times on cable I would have to say this would be Morgan Freemans best performance out of all of his films There should have been an Oscar for him This film definitely beat out Million Dollar Baby for which he ultimately and finally received his first Oscar The Academy wasnt all there when Shawshank deserved its due Robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job however Freeman carried the film A true drama that shows the bond of two people in horrible circumstances Yes this one is one to own if you dont have itbuy it You wont be disappointed,Positive
This is without a doubt one of the finest films of the last  years I think that if it had been released with more fanfare and didnt have such great competition that year it might have won for Best Picture This film has such a powerful presence that it has a life of its own apart from the cast score cinematography etc all of which are deservedly great This is one of those movies that you can switch to when you are channel surfing and stop and watch the rest of it no matter what part of the movie you are at Perhaps The Godfather and Jaws are a couple of others that do that for me and it never gets old no matter how many times you watch it One thing that disappoints me regarding this film is what has happened to the director Frank Darabont Unfortunately he has never come close to achieving the greatness of Shawshank with his subsequent films I thought The Green Mile was good but it didnt hold a candle to Shawshank I was also very disappointed in The Mist I sincerely hope that he is able to recapture some of the magic of Shawshank Redemption in a future film because he definitely does have the proved ability to do so,Positive
The people who wrote and directed this should NEVER BE ABLE TO write andor direct another movie again Colin Trevaro and his fellow writing goons are an embarrassment to hollywood and an embarrassment to cinema I normally wouldnt review a movie on here but I signed only so could leave this review its that BAD I felt like I had to I felt that passionate This movie was a worthless embarrassing piece of garbage The people who made this and the Jurassic World Series destroyed a legacy and that a beautiful one made by Steven Spielberg and his team This movie and the entire Jurassic World series need to be erased from the Jurassic canon And Colin Trevaro and the writers he works with need to be banned from making movies What a joke What an absolute joke,Notr
The reviews made it seem like it was some Birdemic level of movie But it was a pretty formulaic vampire movie with some fun moments Matt Smiths little dance was hilarious he understood the assignment Jared Leto was as good as you could be with this script Watch it if you ever catch it on cable nothing offensive about it In fact it is better than a lot of recent MCU if Im being honest,Notr
Let me tell you a little story I am  years old and consider myself an avid movie buff From Braveheart to American History X to Pulp Fiction to Schindlers List to The Matrix I thoroughly enjoy watching and talking about great movies After being desensitized by the poor gorefest known as Hostel I came home and watched this movie with some friends Let me tell you that this is one of two movies I can think of that has made me tear up I dont do it often and I certainly wasnt expecting to tonight But the Shawshank Redemption tantalizes your mind and touches your soul It is a triumph of motion picture and tonight became of of my top five favorite movies of all time Please go see this in its entirety if you have not,Positive
The actors the script the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen The bestplayed character of the joker is amazing Thats how I imagined him In the film he is portrayed as an ultraintelligent person with a psychopathic brain Honestly I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series Unfortunately we will probably never see the joker so well again because Heath Ledger from unknown circumstances died This is sad news However back to the movie The main character Batman played by Christian Bale also shows the character very well Therefore my rating for this movie is ,Positive
I always thought this movie would be stupid but I put it on for my daughter and were both big fans I have it on at least once a day she really seems to love it If you like puns and dont have a stick up  this is the movie for you,Negative

Everyone thinks this movie is st but its actually good Just enjoy it Remember its just an animation just for fun and dont take it too seriously,Negative
I can watch this film a hundred times and still enjoy it Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors And this must be his best roll ever I thought Tim Robbins was definitely at his best in this film All the prison guards and inmates were really believable The story captures you from the beginning and doesnt let go until the final credits are rolled This is the kind of film that make you think of how many inequities must exist in our prison system that no one ever hears about Of all the the movies of this type the Shawshank Redemtion brings to light how good and evil can exist in every situation And that nothing is black and white But until it effect you its out of sight and out of mind,Positive
This is one of the best movies which I have seen One of the best movie in all terms The best part was the villains role what a world class acting shown by the actor,Positive
Yes its weird I completely agree Although everything different is not necessarily bad The CGI makes the actors look alien but kept their familiar faces I must admit am I the only one that it created a fascinating somewhat creepy attractiveness The choreography is different from what you have seen before but it fits the cat theme perfectly If all the critics would answer truthfully they simply cannot say anything negative about the quality of the dancers If you have seen the earlier musical version of Cats you can see the nice parallels they draw I would give it a  if it werent for the very thin story line and the mediocre singing which almost made me leave after the first  minutes of the movie So I will eventually rate the movie with a  It was entertaining to see something familiar repacked in a weird setting that would fit well in an incoherent dream that I can only describe in this probably incoherent review,Negative

This was a neat movie though complex to follow at times I dont think  out of  is in order but I would say  out of  is well deserved Reminded me immensely of The Matrix at times Visuals were beautiful Music and dialogue were excellent though many times dialogue was hard to make out due to loud music drowning it out  Acting was also great though I am no big fan of DiCaprio who did as expected with that silly smirk on his face almost like Cloonies but the rest of the actors were greatOverall a wellmade movie with a plot full of fresh ideas Go see it but do not set your expectations to the max this way you do not come out mildly disappointed IMO it is way too overhyped,Positive
This movie gives you the true cinematic comic book experience that as a whole is a masterpiece no one will be able to be recreate The movie is brought to a whole by everything and everyone The work done on this movie whether big or small brought something very special Whether it was the authentic portrayals imperfect problems and hiccups the best superhero story ever seen yet or that it is one of the best acting performance ever seen in an action movie This is a forever classic,Positive

I dont know where to start but everything about this movie is actually bad All the dialogs are out of place Its full of forced quotes from the previous movies All the performances are very very awful even the original cast acted so bad and were talking about people like Laura Dern Sam Neil and Jeff Goldblum The plot its so dumb and occasionally nosense Also photography directing visual effects and editing are very low tier if we think about the franchise and the budget,Notr
Thats it thats my reviewNo seriously I had never cringed so much on my life while watching a movie Morbius is a long boring movie with a very weak plot and clich action scenes with some of the most disappointing special effects of  If you havent slept well in a while then this is your movie,Notr
A true masterpiece of its kind never in the history of Hollywood such movie had been made Christopher Nolan man hes absolutely genius,Positive
After hearing so many negative reactions to the film I wasnt holding out much hope for the film However I was very pleasantly surprised Really enjoyable watch The singing was beautiful The ballet wonderful The CGI wasnt as odd as described and within  mins I was very used to the cats appearance Really nice film with a beautiful story,Negative
Quite obviously the best superhero movie ever made By a large margin as well Nothing before or since has even came close including the other two movies in this trilogy and probably never will Dark mature sophisticated exhilarating emotional and a true acting powerhouse Pure cinema,Positive
With physicsdefying thunderous action heartwringing emotion and an astonishing performance from DiCaprio Nolan delivers another true original welcome to an undiscovered countryThe story can either be told in a few sentences or not told at all Here is a movie immune to spoilers If you knew how it ended that would tell you nothing unless you knew how it got there And telling you how it got there would produce bafflement The movie is all about process about fighting our way through enveloping sheets of reality and dream reality within dreams dreams without reality Its a breathtaking juggling act and Nolan may have considered his Memento  a warmup he apparently started this screenplay while filming that one It was the story of a man with shortterm memory loss and the story was told backwardsLike the hero of that film the viewer of Inception is adrift in time and experience We can never even be quite sure what the relationship between dream time and real time is The hero explains that you can never remember the beginning of a dream and that dreams that seem to cover hours may only last a short time Yes but you dont know that when youre dreaming And what if youre inside another mans dream How does your dream time synch with his What do you really know,Positive

I enjoyed the movie I also thought Letto did well  things Its an origin story of a character that hasnt been in another movies so far I think that given a sequel it could only get better because all the basic character development would be out of the way Its a vampire movie not a marvel movie and I feel like that threw people off Its different Its hard to stand out when youre released so close to movies like SpiderMan Venom  and Batman I think this could be a tortoise and the hare thing,Notr
I honestly thought it was a really good film It did often feel a bit lacking in real character development or storyline There were a few characters i really expected them to do more with and when they didnt it was frustrating Obviously because of all of this i do understand its negative reviews but with that said i was still completely captivated The acting was great The effects were interesting Would definitely watch againin fact i would genuinely love to see a sequel if they fleshed it out properly with some meaningful side and background characters and maybe a bit more depth for morbius himself Overall i gave it  because despite a lot of lacking areas it was a really good movie and a fun watch I hope they take it further and not let this be the last we see of morbius,Notr
This was pretty much a copy of every other film in the series but not as fun as most They put just about everyone who survived all of the other films into one They were cutting between at least three groups or individuals in the middle act and by the end theres nine people running to get off the island It was all a bit much,Notr
I enjoyed this the first time I saw it But then again I was only an easily impressionable yearold craving for new emotion Recently more than  years later I revisited it and barely managed to finish it Bluntly its as plain and trite as it gets In fact I believe Frank deliberately wanted it that way so that it would increase its appeal to the casual movie goers In general I have no problem with a simple feelgood movie that does not take itself too seriously and is not looking to change its audience in a profound way However this does and it seems it is succeeding unfortunatelyWe have a story about hope and its redemptive qualities portrayed by an innocent man that is sent to prisonTims character Its told through the eyes of his closest prison friendMorgans character The narrative framing and flow are rigid there is no rhythm no ebb and flow no metaphors no irony just constant relentless narration  extreme simplicity Its stripped to the point that you can only remember the generic message Dangerous stuff Some people carry it around and apply it diligently The others only observe the snowball effectI hope there are more intelligent endeavors out there I hope everyone sees them and appreciates them I hope  Skip this if you are over  There is no art here  almost no contribution to the art of filmmaking and storytelling,Positive

I have to preface this that I never saw the Broadway musical or previous movie I had no idea what the story line was I was just expecting a musical about cats So why the horrific reviews I dont always love musicals The songs in these were somewhat weird I only knew of the song Memories But I thought Francesca Hayward was cute and very watchable as well as Laurie Davidson and Robbie Fairchild Loved the dancing and the sets We go to movies to either learn something andor be entertained Did I learn anything No but now I know what Cats is about Would I see it again No Was it terrible No The dancing the sets the cat acting and the weird story line  it was entertaining and visually impressive,Negative
This movie was pretty good My Son and I enjoyed watching it The animation was good and the story line was pretty good as well There was some references that older viewers could relate too and everyone in the Theater seemed to enjoy the movie with plenty of laughter The only reason I didnt rate this movie a  was because of some feminist comments that were made Of course children wouldnt understand it but its irritating that many so called writers feel compelled to include some form of male bashing or feminist propaganda in a movie These movies would be so much better if they left the male bashing out but it seems if a movie cant be full of cussing they stick feminist comments into it Why cant a movie be made without having to bash a gender or race There was only two comments made one was slightly offensive but the other was a highly sexist feminist comment Nothing like making a childrens movie only to put a few male bashing comments in it like we dont already have enough of that in commercials or the PG movies,Negative
Back then the first Matrix movie was a revelation for sure one of the best movies made in the s I also liked the sequels a lot  despite some flaws here and there Anyway The Matrix Resurrections is what I expected and feared  a very mediocre movie compared to the original trilogy Who needs this one Why was it even made  the story was told and Resurrections adds nothing really new or any good Like that new Resident Evil fail this one I watched once and I will most likely never put on a screen again I will take the blue pill and forget its existence,Notr
I know that The Emoji Movie  has a lot of hate in it But in my opinion I love this movie The reason why I loved it is because of the emojis  the apps as well I would recommend this movie to my grandfather my mothers father because hes into Apple productsI LOVE EMOJIS,Negative
This movie is way better than I expected it to be and i do blame Sonys marketing for that they didnt really do things to get me hyped and with all the delays and all they couldve do it betterBut besides that the pov camera standpoint is truly a joy to watch and probably with the fight scenes the best thing about this movieThe Storyline how ever isnt really believable and im not taking about a man turning into a vampire and all no im more going towards the relationships and the way the script evolves during the runtime of the movieAlso  after credit scenes,Notr
We have all see movies comedies action and dramas We all liked ones hated others got into some other even and felt like part of it In Shawshank Redemption you start slowly after a while you get attached by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else then comes a last  minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics I felt warm strong happy and all other emotions one can think of I felt I was the one who won who got out of prison i was simply fully satisfiedThis movie must be used as an Antidepression by therapists this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldnt give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different  much higher rating scale than the Oscars its simply over qualified,Positive
Morbius is a boring dull film that is so bad you have to turn off your brain to enjoy the film or watch it five timesMorbius has a colour intro that doesnt fit the aesthetic of the film that already makes it bad and the two post credit scenes make no sense but across the spiderverse it does fix the issue but its still bad I will not watch it againI wouldnt waste your time but there are a lot of mixed reviews on here so it is personal preference by the looks of it I dont know why they chose morbius they could have picked a spider man villain that is more recognisable Instead we got this,Notr
Trite formulaic tosh Its so bad Ive downloaded this app and created an account just so I can review it I enjoyed the other movies although none had the magic of the first but this is almost as though the writers couldnt be bothered  Or all the budget went on getting all the original actors back Such a waste and dont get me started on the number of times a massive predator was able to take to creep up and take the cast by surprise were they genetically modified to tip toe Im annoyed with this movie I was looking forward to seeing it and basically after the first hour I became so apathetic I decided to spring clean my email accounts while the film dragged on to its end,Notr
First of all let me start by saying this film is in the elite list of best ever sequels Only a few sequels in film history have been better than the first this film is one of the best examples of that The first in the trilogy was a solid movie but what The Dark Knight did was take it to that next level it brought in some of the best characters in a genius way and elevated it to a modern classicA lot of this films success is down to the perfect casting Christian Bale reprising his role as Bruce Wayne  Batman Heath Ledger taking on the Joker in what can be described as one of the best on screen performances in history to Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman as James Gordon although the last  characters are supporting they truly do make the film and give you the heart of the movieWhat Christopher Nolan did when making this movie was redefine a genre every comic book movie since has tried to do what he did with this movie but just hasnt been able to capture the same spark There will always be Batman but I truly believe this will be the one everyone looks to for many years as the greatest of allThe Dark Knight truly is a cinematic masterpiece,Positive
Just dont think of it as a Dragon Ball movie and its actually pretty decent Think of it as a movie with Dragon Ball like scenes and stuff and think this wouldve been better if they just made this Dragon Ball with how similar it is I get it they messed up a bunch of video game and anime movies but just picture most of them as something different but similar to the actual thing and Im telling you its not as bad as youd think I am the hope of the universe I am the answer to all living things that cry out for Peace I am the protector of the Innocent I am the Light in the Darkness I am Truth Ally to good nightmare to you,Negative
It was lit The Emoji Movie was really great at communicating with teenagers As teenagers we feel as though this film really spoke to us on a emotional level They spoke our language It felt nice We use emoji all the time We like to use them while texting our friends and spinning our fidget spinners At first we watched the movie as a joke but then we realized that it was pretty good This is because it is totally super a accurate to our everyday lives as high schools my dudes,Negative

The plot of the movie was kinda interesting and I decided to watch that movie even though Im not a fan of Marvel movies The storyline was kinda uninteresting nothing wow but it was wellwritten The characters were kinda interesting and welldeveloped The filming location of the movie was just nice Of course it was a really intense movie and there were too many fight scenes but none of them were epic Gladly that movie had some creepy vibes and Morbius design was kinda scary The CGI were just fine and the effects were okay nothing really innovative Overall it was an average Marvel movie full of battle scenes and I dont think I would watch that movie ever again Last but not least if theyre gonna make a sequel I dont know if Im gonna watch it,Notr

The Dark Knight is a cinematic masterpiece that redefines the superhero genre Christopher Nolans direction masterfully weaves a gripping narrative filled with moral complexity and intense action Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is nothing short of extraordinary he embodies chaos with chilling charisma and depth creating an iconic villain that lingers long after the credits roll The films exploration of duality justice and sacrifice resonates deeply making it a profound experience With stunning visuals a haunting score and unforgettable performances The Dark Knight stands as a flawless triumph in filmmaking that elevates both its characters and its themes to unforgettable heights,Positive

Enough has been said of this masterpiece so Ill keep my review succinct This truly is my favorite movie of alltime because no matter how many times I see it I still get the genuine feeling of hope the film has delivered since the first time I saw it Everything about this movie is perfect from the cinematography to the acting the casting the writingeverything Its a fantastic example of the power of hope and the true nature of the human spirit When you watch it you just know that every scene is classic so many moments will be remembered forever in film history If anything it just keep getting better with each time I see it I will continue to enjoy this film for the rest of my life,Positive
OK youve seen the summary and youre screaming What kind of sour limey b says that about one of the greatest films ever made Well Ive got news for you look again The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie i agree but is it all its cracked up to be  no At first you think I feel great  what a feelgood movie One cant help wondering that this film on closer inspection is actually unbelievably cheesy Every other second i was hearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder he didnt commit Its stereotypical  and you guys who voted  bought it hook line and sinker But what about the great twist Ok the twist was good but come onlike i said before was it THAT great Ask yourselves honestly was that better than The Sixth Senses or The Usual Suspects Also how come foreign films which are far superior to this get no credit Watch Le Samurai or La Haine or Todo Sobre Mi Madre Far more superior,Positive
Bad scenario bad actors bad fx The person who wrote the scenario has never watch Dragon Ball and does not understand the characters of the best mangaanime everDont waste your time to watch it,Negative
"Well Im going to give this a moderately positive score because I enjoyed it for what it is  a movie version of a stage musical which is based loosely on TS Eliots charming stories I was accompanied by a neighbour who loves her own cats and we had both seen the stage musical many years ago The production uses CGI to enhance the costumes and movements of the human cast and I think this works well The performers are clearly still human beings dressed in cat costumes which seems to be a look that some reviewers cant accept I presume that some of the negative reviewers might prefer cartoon animation but I reckon that what this movie does works well
It isnt Tom  Jerry or James Bond or Star Trek or romantic comedy or of any other conventional genre This is a different kind of movie and I suggest for a different kind of audience ideally catladies who have seen the stage musical at least once",Negative
I thought can a film possibly be as bad as what people were saying the answer is yes this film is absolutely dire in every sense The cgi human cats are disturbing The deep sense of embarrassment for the Alisters and James Cordon was the cherry on top,Negative
There are movies that I love initially Then over a period of time it dawns on me that I have been manipulated royally And then the love I had for the movie turns into dislike then hate and depending upon the intensity with which I had initially loved the movie it turns into utter disgust Titanic tops my list of such movies Inception comes a close second Christ what was all that about Dreams within dreams within dreams come on Tops spinningnot spinning People getting into each others dreams Visually breathtaking it may have been but a great story it certainly wasnt I think the true test of a classic movie is in its repeat viewing I realized Inception was nothing when I sat down to watch it again I couldnt go past the first  minutes It was that boring Somehow my brain refused to suspend disbelief and seemed to yell switch the damn DVD offAnd I didBTW Chris Nolan tops my list of the most overrated directors I still cant forgive him for those utterly dull climatic fight scenes in The Dark Night Rises,Positive
I thought this would be a so bad it was kind of good situation but na Just plain bad bad bad,Negative
An interesting movie with good performances Its basically about hope and hold it together It is the final outcome that matters the mostIs about  imprisoned men who bond over a number of years finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency Robbins Freeman and the supporting cast is good enoughI dont think it is worthy to be the  movie in the IMDb though Thats just not possibleI know that debate started between TSR and TDKAnyway a good overall movie especially if you are into prison dramas then this movie is for you,Positive
Probably one of the worst movies to ever exist Please do not waste your money on watching this movie Its is not worth your time,Negative
The first half of the movie is a mishmash with too many characters and too many storylines to follow I wanted a family movie not a Brated spy action with some dinosaurs on the backC I A vs Mercenaries vs Other mercenaries who hire more mercenaries My yo watched the motorcycle chase with zero interest and finally asked wait whos chasing who again My yo just gave up and reached for her iphoneOh and lets throw in some old characters into this mess Because fan service ChachingIt gets better in the second half of the movie where it all goes back to the nature  adventure format But overall its still a disasterP S Jeff Goldblum still rocks though,Notr
The thing that pisses me off is not the fact the the movie itself sucks I mean seriously You could not have possibly expected otherwise The thing that pisses me off the most is the fact that a person like me will spend weeksmonths pouring hisher soul into a script only to send it to Hollywood and have it thrown into the very pile of junk that should have been the final resting place for this flaming pile of human feces Not saying that my work is the best out there But I do know  things  a film made from one of my screenplays would not exclusively have negative reviews on IMDbcom EVEN if it were an adaptation  my screenplay would not insult an entire nation of people not to mention millions of others in other nations Im sure the same thing goes for most other aspiring writers out thereEVERYONE who was involved in the making of this film should really look back on it as the low point of hisher career and use it as an example of what NOT to do Cant possibly find a better example than this one,Negative
Few films have achieved the enduring acclaim and emotional depth of The Shawshank Redemption Directed by Frank Darabont and based on a Stephen King novella this  masterpiece is more than just a prison dramaits a profoundly moving exploration of the human spiritAt its core the film revolves around Andy Dufresne played brilliantly by Tim Robbins a banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and Ellis Red Redding Morgan Freeman in one of his most iconic roles a seasoned inmate Through their unlikely friendship the story unfolds with themes of hope redemption and the unyielding pursuit of freedomThe performances are extraordinary Robbins brings quiet dignity and determination to Andy while Freemans narration and portrayal of Red imbue the film with wisdom and warmth The chemistry between the two leads is magnetic anchoring the narrative with authenticity and emotional weightRoger Deakins cinematography captures both the bleakness and beauty of Shawshank prison with memorable shots that linger in the mind Thomas Newmans haunting score underscores every triumph and heartbreak elevating the storytelling to poetic levelsWhat sets The Shawshank Redemption apart is its ability to resonate universally It speaks to the resilience of hope even in the darkest circumstances The poignant finale a triumph of the human spirit leaves audiences inspired and deeply movedAlthough it initially underperformed at the box office The Shawshank Redemption has since become a cultural touchstone Its themes are timeless and its characters feel like old friends Its a film that rewards repeat viewings revealing new layers with each watchIn summary The Shawshank Redemption is not just a filmits an experience A story that reminds us that hope is a good thing maybe the best of things If you havent seen it you owe yourself the gift of this cinematic masterpiece,Positive
Ok I know I am not the only one wondering why they decided to make the remake of this Play on Broadway was awesome this Not so much Between the border line weirdos in the audience claiming to be furries this should be rated nc just for that How many neutered crotch shots can we see in one film sorry cats but you are for the dogs,Negative
If your going to make a movie based on a very great series than at least put more time and effort into it I think Dragon ball movies could be great but if its rushed then dont even release in the first place This movie is about  done im not saying dont give it a watch but you might find that if you download it to the computer skipping parts of the movie will become a common thing for you to do throughout i found myself skipping to the fight scenes I tried to watch the scenes with no fighting but they were just so boring I think the acting was awful as well I hope this movie gets put into the hands of real film makers and that the next one is fully complete and can actually be as well done as the anime was all these years,Negative
To tell you the truth I was not a fan of Batman and I really dont like comics I saw The Dark Knight because my boyfriend wanted to see it And Im glad to tell all the world around me  The Dark Knight is super great and the unique one I think its not necessary to comment Heath Ledger and his role In my opinion the main character in this movie is not Batman but The Joker Ledger gave life to his crazy character As I have said at the beginning of my comment I was not the fan of Batmanbut sometimes must man change his opinion One special thank to Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard  The Batman soundtrack is phenomenal So go and watch it its a breathtaking,Positive

This particular movie is the absolute best ever and should be rated  of all timesWith all the pages of comments that have been posted on this site I will not even attempt to add to the eloquence of the previous commentsI have noticed that many people have posted that they did not see this movie in the theaters I would not even watch the movie on VHS as my wife and children begged me to take a look at the filmThe title did not appeal to me and I did not understand the title I dont particularly like any prison movies I just would not watch the film and I was probably watching ten movies per week at that timeI finally watched when one night I could find nothing appealing in the video store From that moment in  Ive probably watched the movie about  times per year for the last eight yearsPeople refer to all the classics as being such masterpieces but I disagree Citizen Kane Some Like It Hot African Queen Casablanca Godfather and all the others can not compete with anything about this movie,Positive

I have come here writing my review after just watching this wonderful film My soul is full Overflowing tears of joy down my face Therefore I am afraid that the tremendous emotion tremble will not let me be objective However I really do not care Im just writing to share with all of you the greatness of this movie A movie that brings to screen hope despair true friendship perseverance and human nature like no one before If you just are reading reviews to see if the film is worthwhile well dont lose more time and watch it,Positive
It went too big Personally there was just something wrong with Nolans interpretation of the whole dream thing I got uber bored and i thought most of the stuff was too predictable People were freaking out saying this was the best film ever and it was mindblowing and all that jazz i FELT THERE WERE TO MANY PLOT HOLES AND GOT SICK OF THE FILM ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH It was truly not even remotely as good as it was made out to be  It wasnt as good as it was supposed to be  I didnt end up liking any of the characters that much  Nolans fanboys get on my nerves  I have a friend who obnoxiously is obsessed with Nolan and that makes me biased  I had higher expectations based on Nolans previous films,Positive
This movie is an outrage to the original workI mean everything that is beautiful and astonishing in the Jurassic Park concept is completely absent in this filmThey actually shot a movie that looks like it came out of the monsterverse but of poor quality taking out the dinosaurs and adding random stuff If already in the first two of the World saga the creatures have completely stopped behaving like animals but have been humanized to excess do you remember the smile of the indoraptor I remember it while I sleep here they are a simple outline to totally unrelated events The cast is simply out of control The only positive aspect that comes to mind about this socalled movie is that Crichton is no longer with us and he would not be able to witness this abomination Trevorrow had the incredible merit of making me reevaluate Star Wars episode IX,Notr
I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to seeThe Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie add him to Christian Bale as Batman Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magicI am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in  words or less but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinionIf you have not already seen this movie after  years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see itOne of the easiest movies to rate  out of ,Positive
We get a final gathering of all the familiar faces in this maybe final episode Its a lightweight feelgood movie that focuses on the core elements of what made Jurassic Park so great Without annoying child charactersAnd the new reality exploring the consequences of dinosaurs coexisting with humanity offers something we havent seen yet Its not as thrilling and doesnt have these inawe moments But thats OK Its still a great adventure in the Jurassic Park universe and a fine end for its legacyThe CGI was great most of the timeWith its fine balance between nostalgia and innovation its a recommendwatch for fans of the series,Notr
It went in a different direction than I imagined Although it could have ironed out a few things better and it used the battery thing again I still liked it In fact I will watch it again Im not sure if it will hold up with repeat viewing But for now I find it to be a fun ride,Notr
Nothing in the history of the entertainment industry compares to this films wonderful inspiring and completely unforgettable ending The title of the film is the on criticism you could make of this masterpiece If you talk to any group of people about whats the best film ever made youre almost guaranteed that someone in the group will mention this filmThe script is superb and both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do make it a moving story of friendship dignity and most importantly hope Its one of those films where you feel obliged to recommend it to everyone you know Theirs something so special about this film and you shouldnt be allowed to talk about films if youve missed this gem,Positive
This is a fabulous life affirming film with Tim Robbins giving a majestic performance in the lead role as Andy Dufresne a man serving a life sentence in an horrific penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover Its based on a Stephen King novel and the tale is told in part by one of the best uses of narration in cinema history in the form of Morgan Freemans fellow prisoner Red who charts Andys efforts to combat the harsh regime of the sinister Warden Norton deftly played by Bob Gunton Its an engrossing tale that stays long in the memory ultimately as a celebration of humanity and the strength of the human spirit against impossible odds A lovely performance too from James Whitmore as old time prisoner Brooks,Positive
This is the worst movie ive ever seen couldve guessed by looking at the pictures and commercials for this movie as it looks HORRIFYING which it is i really want to know who thought this would be a good idea they should be jailed also how is this movie nominated for a golden globe ive seen maybe  good reviews about it and they didnt make NEARLY as much as they spent to make this movie this whole thing is a mess that needs to go away,Negative
This film is love it or hate it flawless I find myself unable to pick out any one element of this movie that was poorly executed or inconsistent The Director Frank Darabont despite his muchlessthanimpressive filmography successfully animates every scene and character in living detail Whats more is the life and detail he brought to his screenplayOriginally published under Richard Bachman Stephen Kings oncepseudonym Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption is one of the most miserable short stories ever hacked out by any desperately uninspired fiction author in history The book makes no attempt to build or define characters background or story progression It basically apexes around the one scene in the prison theatre where the writer clumsily tries to convey the point of the book as hopeless as a mans situation is his dreams and fantasies live on After Kings catharsis he seemingly looses any real interest in his story and apathetically caps it off several pages laterFrank Darabont not only masterfully directed this film but deserves much more credit for crafting  of this movie purely from his own imagination and being able to construct a very tangible plot line from complete tripe Credit where credits due Stephen King doesnt even deserve royalties,Positive
This is the only movie got  stars from me Although there are many great movies that deserve  stars I had to make this movie special and give  stars only to The Shawshank Redemption The best movie ever made so farThere is something very special about this movie that I cannot even describe It just affects you deeply and you start having hopes The acting is perfect The story is told very good and progressively gives you excitement It has a heartwarming end despite the all the sad stories that are told during the movie This movie will stay as the best movie of all time It deserves to be in the first place because the throne is only for kings It cannot be shared,Positive

Batman The Dark Knight is an absolute masterpiece that transcends the superhero genre and stands as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all timeOne of the most remarkable aspects of this film is Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker Ledgers portrayal of the iconic villain is nothing short of mesmerizing He completely disappears into the character delivering a chilling and unforgettable performance Ledgers Joker is chaotic unpredictable and utterly compelling His every scene is a masterclass in acting and its no surprise that he posthumously won an Academy Award for his roleChristian Bale continues to excel as Bruce WayneBatman His brooding intensity and unwavering commitment to the role make him one of the most compelling Batman interpretations to date Bales dedication to his craft is evident in every scene and he brings a complex depth to the characterAaron Eckharts portrayal of Harvey DentTwoFace is another standout performance His transformation from a principled district attorney to a vengeful and disfigured villain is handled with nuance and skill Its a tragic arc that adds emotional weight to the filmThe films screenplay penned by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan is a triumph of storytelling It weaves together multiple plot threads themes of morality chaos and the nature of heroism and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish The dialogue is sharp and thoughtprovoking and the pacing is impeccable,Positive

So many holes in the script Has Hollywood run out of ideas Why do they keep making sequels to mediocre movies They spent a fortune on this flick and this is the best they could do shame,Notr
This is certainly a good movie with universal themes of freedom and adversity etc etc but Ive seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one There is nothing revolutionary in the directing The novella by Stephen King is practically tailormade for a movie adaption and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it I think the only reason this movie is  on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted The other truly great movies near the top of the list dont pack the same mass audience appeal that Shawshank Redemption does nor are they shown on TNT  times a year Movies like  The Seven Samurai or Lawrence of Arabia for example would bore many of the people who love Shawshank Redemption and I personally consider those three I named and many others to be far better creations than the Shawshank Redemption Perhaps we should take a poll of TNT viewers on the best movie of all time  Id bet Shawshank Redemption would place first with The Blues Brothers coming in a close second,Positive
I think dark night was the best in batman trilogy for some reasonsAnd one of them was brilliant act of Heath Ledger In my opinion the way he acts makes the joker better than other movies and shows the joker more insane and more anarchist than ever So he was worthy of Oscar But sadly he was unable to receive it himselfBut I think it would be better if there was more scence of him in the movieAnd of course we dont have to forget about Christopher Nolan direction which makes this movie on the best cinematic creations,Positive
Quite deserving of such acclaim the acting is superb the storyline captivating and the cinematography quite beautiful The storyline itself was unexpected and I quite enjoyed watching it unfold Tim Robbins is really incredible in that his character comes off so subtly And lets be honest how can any movie narrated by Morgan freeman be bad,Positive
I cannot believe I spent actual money to see this film I will never look at a cat the same way again I cannot breathe I genuinely thought I was never going to escape the hell that is Cats,Negative
It sucked sorry but it was cringe predictable and annoying This wasted so much of my life I really dont know why I watched this in the first place I would say sincerely Clair but NO I hope you all enjoy this movie just as much as I did My apologies to the creators it looked good but it wasnt good overall  Please never make another one like this disappointed,Negative
Today I took a nap before I went to movie theater since I knew that this movie would be a mind blowing experience There are still parts that I did not understand but probably I will watch it again and I will understand much more better I and my friend called this mind blowing experience as Matrix effectI did not understand Matrix totally when I first watched itI should say that movie is  min but it is worth it I think describing the situation putting things together and presenting a good conclusion could not be illustrated for such a complex story in less than this durationDiCaprios character is full in depth and his struggle in his mind with his dead wife presented in the whole story so wellAlso special effects are gorgeous Some of them were used in Matrix but all those city upside down effects are awesomeI should say that this movie is a really good mind blowing experience Probably most people will say it is a masterpiece I do not know why but it is not as good as Matrix Actually when I first watched Matrix I thought as the same way So my critics could change when I watch it againI strongly suggest Matrix lovers to watch this movie Probably you will not totally understand in first time and you will definitely want to see it againI did not vote for this movie yet since I did not totally understand the whole situation there are a lot of points which I did not see or understand I will give this movie a second chance Well job Nolan,Positive
Im not sure of WHY there are very low ratings Its a good and funny kids movie There was a plot and I thought the movie flowed very well I truly enjoyed laughing at the characters on screen PLEASE take young kids They WILL enjoy themselves Tweens and older kids may not enjoy it as much,Negative
I gave this a  because there is more I liked than I didnt I felt like the progression of the story was slow and they did spend a lot of time remaking old nostalgic scenes from the past I did like a lot of the new things they added although nothing felt groundbreaking about it Yet Im still so torn because I loved it I felt similar to when I watched the original trilogy it gave you a lot to think about I want to watch it again because I feel like this is something I need to absorb at least twice,Notr
Im not sure why there is so much hate Its definitely a darker Marvel movie Everyone did a good job in it and I think the two leads were well cast There were a few plot holes but the graphics and camera angles were awesome It was a good origin story,Notr
Im not going to waste anymore time to write a long full review of this movie after already wasting  min of my valuable time In one line I can say this movie sucks Everything in this movie is bad The entire cast was wrong acting was poor and visual effects totally unconvincing The story was very shallow and failed to leave any impression At one point I started laughing by seeing a black man acting as a buddhist monk in a remote mountain In the end I left the theatre aghast with myself and admonishing myself for making a such a poor choice If you guys really want to know what a real bad film is then you should watch this movie otherwise not,Negative
Its amazing to see the original cast of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World Its like a reunion adventure movie I was expecting a more in depth connection of those characters but seems it gave us a small treat or preview only given the run time they could combine more further Nevertheless it was a great movie to see especially to those Dino fans like me,Notr
The only way this film would have been worse is if the Velociraptor started speaking to Chris Pratt Ridiculous Joyless CashGrabLazy actingscript must have been written by a toddler who has a dinosaur figuremixed with actors who wont get a big payout like this for the rest of their careersexcept Chris PrattTragic,Notr
One of the best Di Caprios movies The storyline is perfect,Positive
On the bright side of this movie When Im feeling down I remember at least I wasnt involved in the production of this mess,Negative
SHOCKING  years and this is the best they can come up with Another awful remake the characters are a shadow of what they once where The storyline had so potential to work with and they created this garbage Absolute disgrace to the original trilogy these modern day writers and film producers should be ashamed what theyve done here,Notr
The people who rated this  are out of their minds and blinded by fandom This is easily one of the worst movies in the Marvel catalog  possibly the absolute worst Sony does not know how to make good movies and people seriously need to stop rewarding them for this garbage If you keep throwing money at them for any trash they put out thats all youll ever get  trash,Notr
I enjoyed the callbacks and the new stuff Id give a ten just for the chase scene that involved a Kei class van and dinosaurs laughed a bit in that part and can I forgive any plot holes and supposition Easy to watch and Im glad I did,Notr
I never really got the Jurassic Park thing This was sort of a way to tie it into modern genetics and give us a bunch of famous actors But there was so much pointless dinosaur violence that just stopped being suspenseful And another trope of the big bad corporation that was so predictable the whole time Throw in a black lady with attitude and it just seems like the goal was less telling a story and more appealing to constituents And people are right  hours is way too long for this simple story when nothing of significance warranted itI think the final problem form me was the now common story element telling us our elected government officials can or will take care of a major problem such as corporate malfeasance Yeah right Pretty amazing cynicism in this day and age,Notr
Im not going to tip toe around it this film is crap Its completely unoriginal its not artistic its not demanding except for being boring You will not learn anything about the world through this filmThis film is not a part cinematic history unlike nearly all other films in the top  It is predictable and emotional crapBut even if your not into cinema and you just like popcorn entertainment there are far better movies out therebasically any on the video shelf,Positive
I dont know why this movie has such a poor rating perhaps its because the people that watched it werent big musical fans or had never seen the original cats But I personally think that this movie was done way better than the original stage production The CGI is beautiful The music is so much more catcher than the original production the scenes are beautiful and it has an amazing cast Biggest thing of all this is SO much easier to understand Bravo,Negative
Truth is im a big fan of combat movies with tons of vfx I agree with all the other comments the ones who created this movie havent watched enough episodes The storyline and everything is messed up nothing relates to the original anime series Its like making a movie after a movie but all you watched is the trailer This movie is not made for the fans of the Dbz anime series even tho the creators probably thought they were making it so The least they could do is keep to the original storyline not just take the characters and make your own story wich is worse Even i would have come up with a better DragonBall movie than this,Negative
Matrix actually is a very good example how to destroy an excellent idea The first movie as we all know was epic  No one of the best movies ever made But the rest including the computer game and anime was really really poor in every possible way So Lana  if you want to cash this in please make the world a favor too and SELL THE RIGHTS OF THE MATRIX FRANCHISE Maybe someone with real vision and good ideas may take it further,Notr
THS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE ITS GUT WRENCHING I HATE IT NO ONE LIKED IT IT WAS JUST CRAP,Negative
I dont understand why everyone has such a problem with this movie Its far from being the disaster that the Street Fighter movie was I mean I have no idea what the anime is about or how close it sticks to it but I had a hell of a lotta fun watching this It really felt like a live action anime It featured a good looking cast good special effects and pretty good fight scenes Sure the film was silly and even less sillier than most animes are It look a lot of getting used to to see what they were going for and truth be told somethings just work better animated But all in all a very entertaining film not very deserving of the unfortunate rep its getting,Negative
This movie is the epitome of cancer Real actual cancer I have never sat in a movie theater before and actually thought I want to kill myself Why does this movie exist Who conceptualized it WHO AUDITIONED FOR IT WHO PITCHED IT TO SONY WHY DID SONY AGREE TO THIS In conclusion this movie makes me want to blow my damn brains out every time I think about it AIDS Pure AIDS,Negative
Well after all the glory this film has had I decided to watch it And for my opinion it wasnt that great Was it the hype I dont knowI just didnt like that much to esteem the movie as  in IMDb top  list It was just as boring as Stephen Kings book are Afer all acting was great I have no bad things say about that its only a bad script for my opinion Nowadays when theres such realistic prison descriptions as OZ and Prison break this one doesnt give the spark For a good prison movie I reckon the following If you wanna see a good prison movie you should watch  Blood In Blood Out  If you havent had a chance already Now theres a reality check and a great movie which havent lost its bestbefore date like this one has,Positive
OMG not since MegaForce httpwwwimdbcomtitlett has such an abomination hit the big screenIts obvious that no though went into any continuity between the animated characters compared to their respective ha actors Perhaps it was just me but each characters direction seemed to be that of watching a colony of ants at work In other words you see that they were all doing something but to the untrained eye youre not able to define their exact role This was nothing more than  minutes of random events taking place All I kept thinking was a quote from Peter Griffin my God why dont somebody throw a pie When the lights finally came on in the theater the disappointed reaction from everyone Dragon Ball fan or first time novice was the same PLEASE LORD DONT MAKE A SEQUELAnd why was Ernie Hudson in this spectacle Im just glad that he wasnt cased as Mr PoPo or I wouldve really been offended,Negative
I thought the film was confusing while mildly entertaining Seemingly the idea is Neo and Trinity were trying to be kept apart at all costs because their connection always disrupted the programming of the matrix at least this is how I perceive itThe film tries to do a lot in a short period of time and I just dont think it was as ground breaking or entertaining as its predecessors At the same token it wasnt a complete waste of time Im probably not going to watch it again and it wont hurt if you wait until this is available on dvd or to stream online I wouldnt run out of your way to see it like I did unless you are an absolute die hard fan of the matrix,Notr
The Shawshank Redemption isnt just a movie  its an experience that hits you deep in the soul With powerhouse performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman every scene is soaked in raw emotion hope and unbreakable human spirit The storytelling Flawless The pacing Perfect The ending Pure cinematic goldIts not full of action or bigbudget effects  but it doesnt need them Its quiet powerful and unforgettable The message of resilience and redemption sticks with you long after the credits roll Honestly if you havent watched it yet stop everything and do it now This isnt just a movie Its a lesson in lifeEasily one of the greatest films of all time,Positive
Theres nothing this film does wrong Any complaint I can muster is nitpicky about the cadence of certain scenes or decisions made in the cinematography etcFilm is packed with memorable sonic moments and beats is driven by stateoftheart acting and effects and a plot that is just another installment of Nolans genius An unmissable addition to the American canon of great film,Positive
I have never been a big fan of Batman I went to see Batman Begins when it first came out and havent seen it a second timeI saw The Dark Knight and I thought it was a very good movie Because I dont know a lot about Batman a few points were a little hard to follow Overall though you wouldnt have to see the first movie in order to understand or really have seen the cartoons or read the comics eitherAs others have stated already Heath Ledgers performance was incredible Hes portrayal of The Joker was extremely creepy and psychotic adding humor to his morbidity The plot kept me guessing and wondering how it would endThis movie was very enjoyable and I will probably see it again,Positive
Dinosaur movies that are not fun great visual effects but that do not give emotions even the characters and the story of the film are not convincing An insufficient film,Notr
Everything in this movie is perfect Joker Heath ledger  nailed it I love the cinematography And nolans directing,Positive
I watched the Emoji Movie yesterday and I actually loved it The Emoji Movie isnt really that bad after all I did not cringe at all The emojis are cute and funny especially Gene made many funny faces Their jokes are funny You should take your kids and family with you to see this It is a legitimately decent colorful adventurous and touchingly heartwarming This Emoji Movie seriously made me wanna watch this again and again And now here is an angry message to the people who write inappropriate bad reviews Shame on you Its just a harmless kids animation How could this film considered to be suicidal cancerous and cringeworthy How can this film possibly will kill you You people are overreacting and taking this movie way too seriously Theyre just Emojis and theyre not real So stop taking them so seriously Sony has worked very hard to keep you folks entertained just like Disney You people should be ashamed of yourselves for brainwashing forcing families with children to not watch this film for dumb reasons writing inappropriate reviews and giving low scores for an innocently decent harmless kidFriendly film,Negative
This is a stupid movieFirst of all this is the most stupid movie ever seen in my life Do not emoji they want to escape from their world Its sheer nonsense Second they only did it to earn more money They could have taken The third film from Hotel Transilvania but do not guess That have This film ridicule and third thanks to this movie they canceled Popeye and now a live action movie I hope Get out fast Hotel Transilvania THANK YOU SONY FOR THIS STUPID MOVIE MOVIE Atte A viewer for Sony Animation fans,Negative
Ive lost count of how many times i have watched this Returned to it after watching Joker Different interpretation but Ledgers Joker is perfection,Positive
The simpler it was the better it becameThe movie just showed me what I need to do in oder to become like him Thats how great the movie was A real detective story minus the characters cape and horns The movies complex plot was a product good understanding of a simple storyI like the way Bruce Wayne was portrayed a renewed man pretending to be a spoiled brat This is just a good way to hide his true identity by being what people expect him to be Like the Art of War when you are strong you pretend that you are weak A true player of the system so he can continue with his workThe Joker in this movie is just great evidence of great acting When you begin to see the character and not the actor you begin to understand that Heath did a great job on the Joker I remember the Joker not HeathThe movies theme and music became my lastsongsyndrome great score by Hans Zimmer The theme was really thought off and studied well understood the need of the storyAll I can say is this is what great movies are all about,Positive
Some of these reviews are embarrassingWhen I read a review I dont want a step by step account of what happened in the filmSome people just want actorsactresses to fail and some reviews here are patheticThis film was enjoyable l having no prior knowledge of the character may have been better as some seem to be annoyed with how Morbius was portrayed but it seemed fine to me and Leto was decent throughoutYes its a generic story but one that looks like it needs to be told this way and will only get better as more comes throughI think people are so annoyed at the MarvelSony saga they cant just appreciate a decent film when they see one in a standalone fashionWatch it and make your own mind up dont just see the overal rating as there are many reviews that are ridiculous,Notr
Except the action sequences because the noise wouldnt let me I slept most of the time Actors have acted pathetically Two stars for the bike chase sequence rest is all seen multiple times before Stop making Jurassic movies,Notr
Frank Darabonts The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless masterpiece that transcends the confines of its prison setting to deliver a profound and deeply moving exploration of hope friendship and perseverance The film based on a Stephen King novella is a meticulously crafted narrative that captivates from beginning to end Its a story of an innocent man Andy Dufresne who finds a way to endure and even thrive within a brutal and dehumanizing system The performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are nothing short of iconic their chemistry creating one of the most compelling onscreen friendships in cinematic history The films dialogue is sharp and poetic and its pacing is masterful allowing for a slowburn narrative that builds to one of the most satisfying and emotionally resonant conclusions in filmIs it a remake of another film No it is not a remake It is an adaptation of Stephen Kings novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank RedemptionIs it worth watching Absolutely The Shawshank Redemption is a classic for a reason Its a powerful and beautifully told story that is as inspiring as it is unforgettable,Positive
The movie has a very generic story bad character design bland setting average animation and voice acting the dialogue is boring and doesnt sound natural and the biggest problem of all the movie is filled with unsubtle ads for example in one scene they play candy crush and theres a voice that says CANDY CRUSH and the logo pops up in another scene the characters are in Spotify in yet another scene they are in Dropbox talking about how safe it is and to top it all of they are in different social medias like Facebook Twitter and Instagram Its like watching an hour and a half of ads Dont watch this movie even ironically it is that badConclusion dont watch this under any circumstance other than wanting to torture yourself,Negative
It truly shows how little effort went into designing the plot when everything that could be badly written is The main plot the main and side characters the ending the obvious cliches for bad and good the dialogues Even the after credit scenes How do you even manage to do that badI wanted to see it to understand the memes and now I do It is bad with or without famous actors on the leads Cover crap in golden foil and itll still be crap I guessIts as if someone used ChatGPT to get an idea of a movie about a vampire and just went along with whatever came firstHell maybe even ChatGPT could have done better,Notr
As others here have said this film is really not a film at all but a movie length advertisement for smart phone apps that corporate America wants you and your children to download after you watch the movie Its just a shameless cynical cash grab Very sickening to say the least Not only that this film steals concepts from much better films such as Inside Out WreckItRalph and The Lego Movie Its that unoriginal and lazy I really feel particular disappointment in Patrick Stewart whom I have enjoyed watching in the Star Trek franchise and the XMen movies but I guess even he is willing to sell his soul to play talking poop if the pay check is right A shame,Negative
The Shawshank Redemption is not just a filmits an experience that quietly settles into your soul and stays there long after the final frame A perfect  feels less like a rating and more like an acknowledgement of cinematic greatnessThe outofthisworld performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the beating heart of this masterpiece Tim Robbins brings Andy Dufresne to life with remarkable restrainthis calm exterior masking resilience intelligence and an unbreakable spirit Every glance every silence speaks volumes making his journey profoundly moving without ever being melodramaticMorgan Freeman on the other hand delivers one of the most iconic performances in film history as Red His narration feels like wisdom passed down through generations and his acting is layered with warmth regret hope and quiet redemption Red doesnt just tell the storyhe becomes the emotional bridge between the audience and Shawshanks wallsWhat truly elevates the film is how gently it explores hope friendship and freedom It never rushes never forces emotionyet somehow leaves you deeply moved inspired and reflective Every rewatch feels rewarding revealing new nuances and deeper meaningA flawless story unforgettable characters and performances that define acting excellenceThe Shawshank Redemption earns its  not by spectacle but by soul,Positive
How on earth this damp effort is taking as much as x as much as Maverick is beyond me I am speechless Revisited way too often to make a credible impact Overlong and time to call it quits,Notr
Hollywood has done it again They tried to copy the comictomovie craze with their tried and tested animemangatomovie craze Guess what happened NOTHING In the case of boxoffice flop Speed Racer this film inevitably jumps the shark with everything that goes wrong when adapting manga or anime to the silver screen Hollywoodizing the source material character personalities right down to their names Obviously Hollywood has serious cultural issues What a shame because its one of the best animemangas out there so if I were you Id watch the original Japanese series over this one Nobody learned their lesson over Speed Racer and sadly in Dragonball Evolution which should have been titled Dragonball Devolution Its one of the worst films of  and a strong contender for the Bottom ,Negative
I am a musical theatre person and love musicals The sets and dancing and songssinging were beautiful I went to see this movie with my friend and we were nothing going into it expecting to laugh at how bad it was and we ended up actually enjoying it The thing I have to say that brought the score down was the fact that the faces are so weird and the cats have human hands and not actual hands and also the plot was really weird Other than that the movie was actually pretty good,Negative
I had huge expectations for this film reading all its glowing reviews And yet even before it started and the menu fired up alarm bells were going off Explosions left right and centre great CGIall suggested a lack of substance For the first  minutes I couldnt believe just how bad this film was Drop the viewer into a complete state of confusion to look goodexcept that this is always a risky strategy one which a only few films have eloquently pulled off the nearest comparable being The Matrix which this most certainly isnt although it tries so hard to be in terms of style and delivery Yes the CGI and special effects are at times breathtaking Its just such a shame that the storyline was utterly ridiculous disjointed confusing dispassionate and so very very boring Great effects DO NOT make for a great film necessarily A note on casting Like the film this is truly awfulwhat on earth was Leonardo Di Caprio thinking My wife totally embraced the subject matter she fell asleep and the only thing stopping me from dozing off was the desperate hope that that this film would improve It didnt Inception completely encapsulates all the worst in Hollywood Utter rubbish,Positive
Watched it at the st showing in my town with my daughter We both liked it Action movie with Vampires Nothing wrong with that It kind of reminded me of the old blade movies in a way Mix those with the st Venom movie and you got Morbius I honestly miss having some horror in my comic book movies like back in the day I get some people may want a long funny drawn out Marvel movie but thats just not this movie It moves along quickly explaining things as it goes Again nothing wrong with that It kept us both entertained for almost  hours,Notr
This film tells the story of an emoji that is unable to keep its facial expression to the assigned expression He is ostracised by the emojis and he has to find a way to hack the source code so he can have a constant facial expressionThe Emoji Movie is actually not as bad as I thought it would be The plot basically says that it is alright for a social outcast to be himself Along the way the story utilises expressions games and apps in daily life It tries to be as close to real life as possible so that people can easily relate to the film However there are times when it feels like several apps have paid big money to be prominently featured in the story It is an entertaining story albeit brainless and less refined,Negative
Its a good film all things considered The problem is that people are judging this movie not on what it had to follow the previous film was horrible If I produced themes and ideas that should not have been introduced So then you have to sequel it well this is what you get The previous movie introduced cloning a girl that was allowed to do something really stupid at the end a character that has never been mentioned it was bad This film had to one follow that and make up for the idiocy that it entailed and be its own thing It did that admirably The old and new casts were on hand They wrapped up storylines There were some really good action scenes and beautiful scenery and dinosaurs So before you start casting stones try to relate to the task they had,Notr
I remember when i first saw this film my friend kept telling me to watch it as he thought it was brilliant well all good things come to those who wait yes i did something I had never done before or since when i finished watching it i rewound it and watched it again straight afterIt has a perfect cast story and the best ending of any film i have ever seenTo sum up in one word magical,Positive
This movie made me so angry I joined IMDb for the sole reason of writing this crappy reviewThis was the worst movie I have ever seenI left the theater very very depressedEvery single person in involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselvesThe acting was horrible the dialogue sucked the story was as stale and rehashed as I dont know day old hashbrowns Look either they put together a team that can do this movie justice or they get the people that did FFVII Advent Children and Resident Evil Extinction to do a CGI versionBottom line this movie was from start to finish DEPRESSING AS HELL The original cartoon especially the original Dragon Ball series was incredibly funny and upbeat I never saw Goku getting put down or picked onThis is just typical Hollywood thinking that if they water everything down for the lowest common denominator theyll generate the most revenue Hopefully the next team to undertake a project of this magnitude will give it the RESPECT it deserves and not give us more Dlist Hollywood GARBAGE,Negative
That was  hours of cats introducing themselves That may be what people sign up for if they go to see this movie but I went in blind Judy Dench looked like the cowardly lion My friend went out as soon as they started introducing railway cat  minutes later after a while he came back and they were still introducing railway cat The cgi was any longer than  seconds of personcat facetime was very very unsettling It was pure awfulness with lots of talented people trying their best to make it watchable and the director still managed to fail You should go see it ,Negative
I still dont understand what Ive watched Never seen such a weird plotstructure if there even was one Did none of those Astars see that either The razzy goes to,Negative
First  foremost they should have left this trilogy well alone As it progressively got worst from the original to revelations But ultimately was a good trilogy and a great originalNow what the  Is this mess That basiclly throws half of the old film in  copies the other half with much much poorer actors as is the nature of this very unoriginal and unimpressive shambles Acting was badddd Script was beyond a joke made by an A hole  Considering its predecessor its patheticI wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless I hated them,Notr
I watched this in the cinema when it came out in  I was only  then and couldnt really grasp the entire movie as it is challenging on its own let alone for an  year old But I remember leaving the cinema completely enthralled by the movie and loving it despite not fully understanding every bit of it Since then I have watched it more times than I can countEvery single actor in this movie gave their best and Nolan outdid himself with this one Truly one of the best movies of all time ahead of the game since it came out  years ago Deserved all the Oscars Tom Hardy was my favorite in this one he added the charmWatch it,Positive
What can I say about Shawshank that hasnt already been said This is one of my alltime favourite movies and Ive seen it maybe a dozen times but I keep going back for moreTim Robbins is cast perfectly as Andy Dufresne a man convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to prison but who somehow never quite lets prison break his spiritIn a sense this can be compared to Cuckoos Nest Andys effect on the prison and his fellow prisoners is much like MacMurphys effect on the mental patients And Warden Norton has a Nurse Ratchedlike character full of selfrighteousness and a kind of indignation at having to teach them a lessonSimple story or not this movie is uplifting and inspiring Wonderfully acted and directed Shawshanks status as a classic is welldeserved,Positive
LOVE THIS MOVIE I like to live in the moment so there were some parts of the film that flew over my head BUT but on the second viewing I caught a lot more of the little nooks and crannies that makes this movie so good,Positive
Okay this isnt the BEST movie out there but I just wanted to say that it could have been a WHOLE LOT WORSE that it was I watched this movie purely because I was curious if it was bad as some people were making it out to be Its not I consider myself to be an adult and even I could relate to some of the messages that this film tried to convey and even appreciated their attempts as cheesy as they may have been at humour This film does in no way warrant the hate reviews that it has been receiving as of late Its aimed at a YOUNGER easiertoplease sugarcrazed crowd of little tweens and to them I can assure you this was gold Its a kids movie What on earth were you expecting,Negative
Ok plot wise this movie is bad and has a bit of a slow start however the action scenes are fun if not a bit Predicable but being the th movie they are out of ideas so you can enjoy the movie if you focus on the Dinos which do not disappoint In the end it could be worse,Notr
I would rather let someone curry fart in my face than watch this abysmal pice of trash ever again,Negative

Jurassic World Dominion is an uninspired corporate product designed by a committee based on various graphs and research results from the test groupsThey did the basic scheme of  Pour a lot of money into a known IP  Dust off the actors from  years ago    ProfitA very costly but uninspired undertaking Only the product design team and the CGI crew showed their bests The actors knew what they were getting into and this shows Its slow full of cliches and selfrepeats Nobody is trying The message the film solidifies in the end was already solidified in  previous moviesI dont want to dig deeper into this There is no point It bored me to death and all the shots of the old cast with nostalgic music made me feel angry and manipulated I cant rate this either Rating this film a  would offend everyone who worked on it but I cant give it moreThe best thing about this film was that it created jobs and paid people for their work Thanks for thatNot recommended,Notr

InspirationalGet busy living or get busy dieingFrom the richness of supporting actors to the lead roles this is the most complete drama film anyone would lucky enough to find on there own like i did on one evening in the video store A Tour de Force from Castlerock Frank Darabont Tim and Morgan FreemanA path a passage call it what you will this is what film for me is all about depth colour emotion and the strangest thing isit just doesnt happen with guys Well i was spellbound and shocked at the ending and then looked after by the director as they completed the film on the beach in MexicoA truly wonderful film worthy of not just the Oscar nominations but the all the Oscars themselves To be taken on a the most wonderful of cinematic journeysThis is what we all dream ofFrank Darabont Morgan Freeman Tim Robbins and Stephen Kings Finest HourExceptional ,Positive
Jurassic World Dominion is a step up from some of its immediate predecessors The plot consists of two stretched out intertwining arcs which separate the original cast from the more recently introduced characters The film does not fail to deliver for what its worth entertainment However its a few dinosaur steps down from the franchises legendary start,Notr
In the move he goes thru this big journey just to become a meh or should i say Unamused face The surprising thing about this movie is that it is exactly how you feel then the movie is over So either the movie is just that bad or they actually planned for that to happen So i really dont know if i should be impressed or not,Negative
Everything that a good movie can have is there is this movie,Positive
Heath ledgers work is phenomenal Direction is outstanding Honestly one of the greatest movies of all times Everything in this movie is great music acting editing directing production,Positive
This movie is so lit Ignore all the other reviews this movie is a masterpiece The characters are good the story definitely isnt filled with clichs and the film is not a cash grab to get teens to use their phones more  movie Would recommend to any one they will like it a lot,Negative
I like the character Morbius his powers are cool Hed be a really cool hero to have at your side He should have his own mini team like the avengersMy friends say it needed more character development and more of a story to it I persoanlly think they did develop the characters and story fairly well but yes they could have done with a little more You dont want the movie to be too long but I think another  mins of story building built up from another  or  mins here and there would have done itI liked the main female character it would have been  would be nice to see their love story develop a little moreI dont like the person he met in cut scene wtf I dont like where thats goingOverall I really enjoyed itCGI was great u cant do a movie like that without lots of CGI ,Notr
Here is the original I mean really people the original wasnt all that great httpwwwonemangacomDragonBall It was the fact that it was in your own personal world that you opened up to it in the first place In all honesty the last movie i saw was twilight So with that in mind the acting was great Hollywood actors usually dont get into there powers in these types of movies Although Piccollo did look a little funny but he was borderline The tone was silly and mischievous the same as dragonball If you didnt like it than go read a few chapters of the one above and write a review on that,Negative
I had the honor of seeing a prescreening of this film tonight in Dallas Now I have seen lots of movies in my time but this movie is by farexcellent I am simply amazed at Christopher Nolan for blessing us with this filmi truly amThe trailers can only give you so much and Im so glad they dont go too much in depth with the plot You are literally drawn into the movieActing Cinematography StoryPlot Mind Stimulation I cannot wait to read more reviews on this film It was well worth  hours and I am positive that I will be seeing it AGAIN later this week when it opens in theatersGO SEE IT,Positive
Emotion hope and justice all blend perfectly in this film Quite simply no other film comes close to this one in regards to screenplay casting and plot development No spoilers here  just a comment on a movie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings Morgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime Everything else comes together in perfect harmony This movie came out the same year as Forrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture  Forrest Gump is a great picture but this one really deserved the cake Tim Robbins is AMAZING as Andy and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could only hope to see assembled again This is one of those rare occasions where the movie actually surpasses the book for drama suspense and flow If you havent seen this film please do yourself the favour and watch it I know you will not be disappointedGet busy livin,Positive
Watched this with an open mind after reading reviews but can honestly say i thoroughly enjoyed every minute a must see for musical lovers,Negative
Let me make it short this is the nastiest disgusting nauseating loathsome sickening nauseous movie made in the history,Negative
The Shawshank Redemption is hands down the GOAT movie  the best Ive ever seen Its a powerful and unforgettable story of hope friendship and resilience inside the harsh walls of Shawshank prison Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give truly iconic performances bringing depth and heart to their characters The narrative builds slowly but masterfully leading to one of the most satisfying endings in cinema history Every moment feels purposeful and the emotional payoff is incredible This film is a timeless masterpiece that inspires uplifts and stays with you forever A mustwatch for all movie lovers This is the best movie I have ever seen in my  years of life,Positive
This movie is completely unnecessary to the Matrix world as sometimes it doesnt even feel like a Matrix movie If not for the many original trilogy flashbacks sometimes I though I was seeing some king of John Wick  or any other scifiaction movie with Keanu Reeves His performance is forgetable and sometimes looks like hes parodying himelf The rest of the cast never got my attention neither the story and I have to be honest I felt the story to be so bad and uninteresting that I had to use my smartphone a lot to avoid sleepingIm not saying you shouldnt watch the movie but be ready for nothing like the original trylogy in any item you can rate a movie Not even the fight scenes are good as they are badly choreographed and filmed and the special effect are just the same as any other  movie Nothing special hereI had low expectations but this is even worse then I was prepared to,Notr
and thats a good thing The anime took what was great from the manga and dragged it out to a fillerslow dump This movie on the other hand breaths new life into the franchise by reimagining the story and therefore bringing new fans that probably wouldnt have stumbled upon the manga otherwise,Negative
Alright folks I saw the same movie you saw My wife and I both went into this with great expectations Visually the movie was interesting Beyond that it was hohum for us I felt myself fidgeting in the seat several times wondering when they were going to get to the point The film was about  minutes too long The concept is very interesting but there are so many loopholes and unanswered questions and illogical contrivances that we both just shook our heads and enjoyed the scenery I have to wonder where all of the high ratings for this flick are coming from I am not buying that as many people loved this thing on the same par as Lord of the Rings and Godfather This movie was so pumped up that I was hoping for something brilliant like The Matrix I feel like I got something more similar to The Happening,Positive
Morbius is not a perfect movie but its a fun and entertaining ride Its a comic book movie and yes it wont win an Oscar or other awards But its still not that bad how some people make it seem it isDefinitely worth watching and seeing it for yourself before being scared off by reviews that are not even slightly accurateJust my opinion ,Notr
Not a bad film Good cinematography takes us through an action packed adventure Some lines are cheesy expected as this is a commercial family film I enjoyed this much more than Jurassic world  I found the story to be far more engaging and old characters sure spiced it up Undeniably though the plot was too scripted at times you would just wait for the good guys to triumph as it is impossible for them to lose a sense of risk or realism would have helped to keep the audience on their toesNot a bad watch at all ,Notr
I think critics are being too hard on this move Im a huge Jurassic Park fan so seeing some of the original cast return was exciting Its just the the plot is nonexistent and a lot of scenes seemed forced and cringey Dont get me wrong its not unbearable but I felt they couldve done a lot better It was disappointing that they focused more on the people more than they did the actual dinosaurs Though I will admit it was cool to see different species on screen but they didnt get enough screen time unfortunately While I liked this one better than Fallen Kingdom and was able to enjoy it with the action scenes and nostalgia a lot of the writing really downgraded it,Notr
Just why Its already bad enough but the icing on top of this horrific computergenerated cake is that these godforsaken abominations are called Jellicles   Dont see this movie I beg of you,Negative
I took my  kids to watch this movie as they left in horror they had night mares about his movie for  days straight it was so horrible they actually started crying in the theater,Negative
Ofcourd science fiction needs you to have a open mind However there is a fine line between down right ridiculousness and science This movie is so far over that line that it becomes unbearable to watch even with a open mind Want to see a good jurassic park movie rent the original,Notr
Ever sincethat fateful day on July th my life has changed eternally  of my time awake is devoted to watching this as everything else I do is immensely boring and sad compared to the genius that is Emoji,Negative
No story here Nothing worth watching Just a waste of time and yes it contains rude humour Why would I want to watch this We couldnt even get through the first few minutes,Negative
"Reading the slating it gets on here makes me think that all the  stars reviewers have never seen the Cats before Its always been a marmite production but for true theatre lovers its an epic representation of TS Eliots poems The film brought more of a storyline to the show and the additional song slipped in nicely Personally I found Jason Derulo disappointing and although Judy Dench was good in her role I would have cast Brian Blessed as a nod to the original west end production of nothing else than his wonderful performance of The Addressing of Cats
Id say dont listen to the haters give it a go with an open mind you just might love it if so then you live the theatre production even more",Negative
I couldnt believe The Dark knight could live up to the hype Thats perhaps the biggest surprise The secret I believe is a stunning mature intelligent script That makes it the best superhero movie ever made As if that wasnt enough Heath Ledger He the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something well never see A fearless extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains His performance is a master class Fortunately Christian Bales Batman is almost a supporting character Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great The Dark Knight is visually stunning powerful and moving What else could anyone want,Positive
I think this kind of movie comes once in a century,Positive
Well made movie the best Batmam ever to be made and probably ever will be Nolan did an excellent theme to the dark knight one never seen before in any of the Batman franchises ever made heath ledgers acting was at its readjust when you thought he was at his best he goes a step further definitely worth being in the top  and so high number  on the list I would definitely recommend watching it even if you are not a Batman fan this will change your view on it finally this brings out a new side to the joker he has always been viewed as a funny character in cartoon but when you watch this your whole idea of him will change for good,Positive
While some of the reviews are fight about plot holes and what not this is a Dinosaur movie We dont need Oscar worthy performances or solid story linesWe all have a child within us that wakes from sleep when we see or hear anything about dinosaurs,Notr
This was my first time seeing this movie and I absolutely loved the movie The drama and the story were really interesting of the whole movie The violence was also very interesting of the film it shows what its like in prison after committing a crime and it shows what friendships in prison It shows a lot of the film just like escaping prison and Reuniting with a friend you have not seen in years Very emotional and very good film the director made this masterpiece well done and well made The cast were really good and the acting was really impressive We need another Shawshank redemption because the first one was amazing also VERY RECOMMEND TO WATCH,Positive
You know I like the Matrix and was very excited for it I saw the trailer and it looked promising but this was not worth my timeIt simply felt empty something was missing I would not recommend watching this movie unless you want to feel completely and utterly disappointed,Notr
This movie was without doubtthe best movie to ever hit the big screen The characters were so real so alive that you could nearly feel their presence in the salon The conflicts were deep and mirrored a perfect reflection of life as we know it I was very touched by the emotional drama that took place and moved to tears by the inspirational ending I have never before been this affected by a film and I truly believe that it is God who speaks to us through this movie,Negative
Yes movie started off slow but overall a great ending to the Jurassic ParkWorld eraIve watched this series since the beginning when in high school  is near  dear to my heart especially the music I do not agree with the low reviews by criticsmovie watchers whatsoever Our audience clapped at the end of the movie  we all left very pleased,Notr
The beginning looked relatively promising but i wasnt too impressed I was thinking that it would just improve as the movie went on but I was wrong very wrongFirst off I didnt like the modern setting Why couldnt they stick to the original show I honestly think they should just remake this movie There were no awesome powers or crazy fight scenes The villains also sucked The dialog was very poorly written as wellFrom the start you have very unlikeable characters Almost everyone was very poorly cast I thought Goku and Master Roshi were fine but Bulma was absolutely terrible I hated her and really wanted her to dieThe ending made me very angry also I was hoping that there would be some epic fight but again I was very disappointed After this fight was over I was left scratching my head in disbeliefTerrible dialog awfully cast characters and a pathetic journey and ending should have made Dragonball Evolution a straight to DVD releaseAnd flying Hummers Common ,Negative
"I like to keep things short and sweet

Oh what a film  This movie is a towering achievement in the superhero genre pushing the boundaries of storytelling and redefining what a comic book adaptation can be Christopher Nolans direction is masterful creating a dark and gritty atmosphere that perfectly complements the complex themes explored in the film Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is truly mesmerizing and unforgettable earning him a posthumous Academy Award The films thoughtprovoking exploration of morality chaos and the nature of heroism makes it a standout in the genre Its a mustwatch for any fan of superhero movies or thrilling thoughtprovoking cinema Dont miss out on this epic Batman adventure ,Positive
Now I said it already  best Jurassic movie so far  and ok Ill happily admit I didnt have too high expectations because I didnt like the previous two installments much tbh but this one at first I was thinking pretty slow start followed by but hey theyre actually building up a pretty good story that makes me care about what happens to the characters next and with a drive of a star wars or James Bond movie keeping your attention and with pretty good CGI supporting the story not the other way around No honestly this felt like a more mature Jurassic movie compared to previous ones I really enjoyed this one and left the movie theatre with a big smile on my face  this is what a night at the movies is all about,Notr
This film has been seriously hyped  like many other viewers I expected much more than it delivered Almost everyone has had that experience of being disappointed by a film that you have been really looking forward to  this was a prime example First of all the acting  Keanu Reeves and Joseph GordonLevitt  separated at birth and neither can act at all I liked Ellen Page very much in Juno but she was sadly miscast in this role Not that any actress could have made sense out of her character  she was at random times a newbie who needed the basics explained andor an authority on how the whole thing worked The plot was filled with these messy holes but it wasnt entirely negative  some of the effects were fun and DiCaprio is always good as was most of his supporting cast On the whole worth seeing just dont expect it to be the best film you ever saw,Positive
If there is such a place as kitty heaven then we must assume there is also a kitty hell If such a place were to exist the demonic entities that would dwell in such a place would resemble the screeching nightmare inducing creatures featured in cats  Im not entirely convinced this was not the intended purpose of this musical flick as no sane person could have thought any of this looked goodright,Negative
Movies Ive ever seen in my life Almost walked out of the theater but my wife wouldnt let me Everyone involved in the making of this film should retire from their work immediately It was that bad Sorta like  of everything else outta the entertainment business in the last decade,Notr
I watched this movie on Netflix to make a reasonable IMDb review and I couldnt stand it so I watched  minutes in Why do yall ask I cant come close to understanding the GOOD reviews for this movie Even a scriptwriter who was messed up in the head and given a major concussion could make a movie script and concept better then this The actors who played in this movie the amazing actors like Sofa Vergara and Jennifer Coolidge were completely wasting their time with this movie They probably did this movie to get more movies on their list no offense to how you major actors work by the way Just dont watch this movie if you are thinking about it I mean Im saving yall a bunch of brain cells and time,Negative

Morbius is definitely a movie the most Marvel movie ever made Perhaps one of the movies of all time I really this movie it was very This movie is very when youre watching it I surely this,Notr
The amazing thing about this film is how many people fail to realise that the film is about Red not Andy Its Reds perspective of Andy I only mention it because many people strangely think its told from the perspective of AndyThat common misunderstanding behind a well made film The photography is magical the story is strong the performances are exceptional and the depths of despair and humanity of canvassed well without losing mainstream appealBut that aside there is a strong willingness to overstate this film In the end it is a slightly overdone and there is a bit too much triumph of the human spirit dribble on the side But I dont let that get in the way of what is otherwise a very good film with rewatchabilityHadleys release from prison and letter deserves a spot in cinema history That part was absolutely exceptional,Positive
The only way to describe this movie in one paragraph is it was like the first time a person has sex its hyped for about  or three years of your life till finally its prom and you got the parents station wagon and you got a hotel in the country all set up for your first big night of love Then you go to pick your date up and shes gotten braces over the weekend OK not the worst thing in the world Then you slip and fall while shaking the dads hand and karate chop his balls and grab her mothers blouse and rip it off on the way down Then on the way to the prom you get a flat and you go and change it and you get oil all over your tux Then you go to the prom and you think itll be so cool now that more people are being added to the mix But its not and it sucks because theres now so much sexual tension built at this time the dudes dont wanna dance for fear of boners and the girls dont want to for the same reason Then you finally leave and get out to the hotel and you think ah well this whole night was crap but this will redeem it This will make it all better Then you realize shes got braces And her hymens still intact And what ensues is  minutes of nothing but blood pain and screams of agony coming from both parties till eventually you cant even look at her anymore and you wont be able to jerk it for a month now because your scabbed penis needs time to heal Yeah thats what inception was like to meStick with Momentoesk stuff dude,Positive

Wow I love this movie To date I have probably watched it nearly  times I am not obsessive whenever it is on I watch itFor most movies at least the dramatic ones I measure them based on how they make me feel This one makes me feel sad when Brooks dies angry when Tommy dies and happy when Red finds his friend This movie makes me feel good I know that is not very scientific but its the truth Because of the way it plays on me I cant help but give it a  Heres whyFirst off the acting Tim Robbins is SO subtle that he strikes me as a person that tries to bury his innocence because in reality it does not matter Few would argue that Morgan Freeman is brilliant as usual But here the supporting cast throws in with equally impressive performancesThe Score Outside the music from the records appearing in the movie the relatively unobstructive score just helps us confirm what our eyes see the walls of Shawshank We feel them through the music and break through them as Andy doesAnd last but not least My compliments on the cinematography The site is perfect for the movie and the clever camera angles and lighting invite us into the dreary prison world,Positive
For all of you who dont agree with me sure the storyline was a little off but if you think about it many people have only read the animes and mangas but not a lot of people havent read the original story The Monkey King wreaks Havok in Heaven There is another movie that relates to that book its the Forbiden Kingdom Once you have read that story you will come to realize that the anime and mangas have been a little off the original storyline As the movie it was good If you would have stuck to the original there would have been a lot of things that the director wouldnt have been able to depict in the movie I am actually looking forward to seeing the sequel,Negative
This film surpassed every expectation I had when I walked into the theatre Not only was the acting brilliant the story superb and just the overall concept and execution flawless but I left the theatre completely mind blown I left in a state of wonder a state that I have yet to come out of even though it has been  hours since seeing itInception has caused me to ponder the nature of dreams and reality made me just sit down and think something so many films nowadays do not do I am  and I am disappointed at how so many films do not strive to be anything special now The main aim is to pull in as much money in the box office as possible James Cameron is even rereleasing Titanic in D and I am dying to know why What is the need More money However Nolans Inception was simply exquisite in every possible way It contained romance comedy suspense fantasy reality and anything else you could ask for There are going to be the reviewers that say this movie was too confusing or that it was nowhere near as good as everyone is making it out to be but I implore each and every one of you to go see this movie and make the decision for yourself This is a film that more films need to strive to be like Far too many of the films that have come out in the past ten years are lacking in one aspect or another but Inception is truly a masterpiece,Positive
one of the films that you must watch in lifetime A film about longterm imprisonment that takes its time to convey what the slow crawl of a lifers existence might feel like Thoroughly gripping and pretty refreshing Ten years ago The Shawshank Redemption was a lowkey prison film that didnt recoup its costs Slowly it has become one of the most popular movies of all time  and for some it has even been life changing It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison but The Shawshank Redemption creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick superficial emotions Shawshank slows down and looks It uses the narrators calm observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars It is deeper than most films about continuity in a lifetime based on friendship and hope,Positive
OK I went to see this with the intention of finishing it but had to leave early but from what I did see people are just being big babys about how bad the movie is I really enjoyed what I saw maybe not as funny as the trailer was but still good would like to finish it at some point os loved the badass jailbrake she was cool and everyone else seemed great too I liked it not loved it and like I said didnt finish it but I had a nice time from what I got to see,Negative
From the very beginning this movie has your attention grabbed and doesnt let go until the final credits begin to roll One of my favorite films Even if you are not a fan of Batman or superhero movies in general this is a movie unlike any superhero movie With varying levels of depth emotion suspense action and amazing special effects this film stands above the rest within and without of its genre Christopher Nolans cinematic genius takes hold in this second installment of his Batman series Christian Bale performs a compelling and adrenalinepumping Batman fights opposite Heath Ledgers chilling take on The Joker The Dark Knight hails as one of the greatest Batman films to ever grace the silver screen,Positive
This Batman is played by one of the best actors such as Christan Bale Heath Ledger Morgan Freeman and other Heath Ledger is the best Joker ever In my opinion Christian Bale is the best Batman and without a doubt the best Bruce Wayne Those two are the best in their roles thats why this batman movie is memorable thats why its the most popular batman movie and the best rated In short whoever hasnt watch this Batman movie should watch it now before that watch Batman Begins and after this part of course this part also has its own continuation Batman The Dark Knight Rises All three parts are excellent but this one is the best,Positive

If you like the Broadway show you will likely enjoy this movie The Broadway show is a string of catchy songs with some dancing and very little plot This is no different Dont expect a story Expect to be entertained The movie builds on the Broadway show and does what is meant to do entertain Dont expect oscar winning plot lines Critics need to be aware of what the movie is working with before they hammer it The movie is well done It exceeded my expectations,Negative

Shawshank Redemption gives the feel of a strong firm and amazing story that can move people while sitting down to watch it The characters are memorable Morgan Freeman as Red will always be in my head Tim Robbins and Any Dufrense is amazing as well Shawshank gives the audience a taste of a perfect movie Movies like this dont come often Movies come with strong stories but acting and flow of this story can mess it up Shawshank doesnt disappoint The acting is superb and the flow of the story is unforgettable Based on the Stephen King novel Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption Id say this is one of the movies where the film triumphs over the novel The film also brings a sense of humor which is a very good tool for films like these because if everything is serious its very possible that it might be killed Well people have their own opinion One scene amazes me and probably is one of my favorite scenes in the film is when the prisoners are watching Gilda and theyre all waiting for Rita Hayworth to do the thing with her hair It still makes me laugh and pleased with the acting and reactions of the prisoner and the beauty of Rita Hayworth herself Shawshank Redemption is a oneofakind film where stories come in and the film enlarges the story and puts it into a whole new level The excellent acting and a great adapted screenplay makes this movie one of the greatest films ever in history,Positive

James Wong should not be allowed to direct again  His arrogance towards the beloved Japanese Anime and Manga is such a slap in the face for all fans of the Series For one thing Goku is not a Human he is a Saiyan from another world and in the early dragonball had a tail  Bulma was a tech genius  not a fighter  Chi Chi was a Gokus love interestand wife in later times and was daughter to the Ox King  Krillin where was he  Gokus best friend Roshi was a dirty old man in the series and had a turtle shell on his back  I could go on  but  I suggest for any Dragonball fan  just  not watch this movie ,Negative

Im only here to stretch the fact that although the movie has a bunch of production flaws including wrong timed lines where pauses were needed predictable story empty characters and all and all a movie thats constantly on the verge of being boring it has its pros tooI felt the animation soundtrack and voices were really good and there was certainly a great deal of talent behind them The movie on its own will likely be amusing to most young children which i hope was the target audience but other than that i dont believe an older teen or adult would find this as enjoyable as the other animations available The movie has been slandered and insulted in many ways and at this point Im referring back to my Summary TitleBad but not the worst,Negative
Its a musical so it has dancing and singing but thats the only thing it has Its just a waste of time No humor no action no excitement Its a long introduction of characters that disappear  minutes after they are introduced It could have been so much more but they chose to make it boring as hell,Negative
Why is Sony hiring Bgrade inexperienced director and writers for blockbuster titles This film had tons of room for improvement particularly in its convoluted and lazy screenplay There are scenes where things are happening and we dont know how or why eg Leaning back and almost falling off the rooftop while getting caught amidst the unexplained sonic waves Didnt any one person see these mistakes even in editing to make what Im sure would be easy fixes Im not sure why the midcredit scene was even needed as it made the already incohesive story more incoherent The premise of the story itself was excellent too bad it became a wasted opportunityCinematography was decent although the SVFX couldve been much better and more exciting Sound and score were on point The  min runtime flew by with the decent pacing almost too much so that I feel another  minutes of better experienced writing couldve gone a long way in making this film much better Casting and performances were great all around Still its certainly not as bad as all the critics say it is and I actually enjoyed it more than Pattinson as emo Batman A well deserved  from me,Notr
This movie is like a rollercoaster the acting of Heath Ledger elevates the movie but Bale doesnt dissapoint no one is bad the action is sooo gooooddd you cant even blink in this movie the duo of Batman  Joker is so well crafted its an antagonistprotagonist relation that develops both especially the protagonist The ending is absolutely peak it gives you that sour felling but also hopeful just absolutely peak but you should watch Batman Begins first its possible to enjoy The Dark Knight without watching it but with Begins its even betterConclusion Watch it its peak absolutely peak,Positive
I knew this movie was gonna suck the moment i saw Goku played by the whitest guy in existence However I watched it later on an airplane cause it was free and i had nothing else to do They pretty much ruined the whole series Why they tried to make it modern with Goku being some nerd in high school I will never know I thought some parts of the movie were pretty hilarious because of how poorly this movie was made The only thing I actually like about the movie was Jamie Chung chi chi because shes pretty cute Other than that this is a garbage movie and I pray to god that there is never a sequel to this piece of trash,Negative
The Shawshank Redemption is perhaps one of if not the perfect film Every other great film or any film for that matter has its pros and cons Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it very few against it While I feel there are films out there with better pros the pro to con ratio of The Shawshank Redemption outstands any other film film ever produced I cant begin to describe every amazing element of this film Obviously the performances are exquisite the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary The cinematography in particular struck me Roger Deakins is a master with light and framing I will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the greatest films ever made This film truly lies within the sweet spot of cinema,Positive

A good number of professional movie critics are not fully honest fearful of burning bridges with those in the industry But this time a larger number have even had a hard time stomaching their disgust for this lazy bloated boring tribute to itselfIn a nutshell this is what happens when a concept should have ended earlier becomes a trilogy that should have nailes the coffin shut and they decide they still want to cash in on an easy reboot of the same intellectual property they own Its so convoluted that it must be explained to the viewer in great detail as if a board room pitch with the questions So sis it all make sense What do you thinkThe answers are no and sets a new low on useless sequels that at least could have been  minutes to minimize the waste of time Its hard to go back to the original with a straight face after having seen this,Notr

All is perfect  the complexity of the characters the suspense the principals themes like friendship loneliness injustice redemption vengeance freedom The most complete movie that ive ever seen Tim Robbins is great sensitive brilliant in one scene he can feel a thousand of feelings Freeman is very correct and seems to be really Red Gunton Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace Titanic is pure entertainment and received  oscars This movie deserves  oscars because it shows what is really important in life No action more realistic more useful than the other films It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it When i see it again I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinemas industry have In a different way only Star Wars Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact,Positive
Im still speechless Who approved this final cut And how much were they paid The only thing that was even slightly good was Jennifer Hudsons climatic performance at the end but it in no way redeemed this movieI got in the car and my friend and I just looked at each other She asked what did we just watch My reply only the worst movie ever I want my money backPlease Dont go Just dont do it Spend that money on a good meal,Negative
Lets just hit the important stuff first As far as the action goes its a Jurassic Park movie Of course the action is going to be a lot of fun Some fun some intense and creative dinosaur action happened and it was engaging With that saidThe story had potential It was handled very poorly I wished that they made me truly care about these characters particularly Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard but the character arcs were weak sadly Instead of developing interesting character arcs that got replaced with the nostalgia factor which for the record Sam Neil Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum still got itAnd honestly the film itself couldve been shorter It did feel like it dragged on unfortunately There were also some character decisions that kind of made scratch my head and was like huh The music was forgettable unfortunately Theres a lot of flaws to this film that I could list But there is still some fun that could be found in this One watch is enoughC,Notr

This movie is very blockbuster of Christopher nolan and i like this movie so much And this movie everybody like this because christian bale nailed it in this movie and its better than robert pattisons movie named batman Some scenes in this movie is mindblowing and crazy i really like this movie The villain in this character is very fantastic and awesome roleplay of villain And im giving this movie as  Christopher nolan choose the right character of hero and im surprised and everyone in youtube got viral and lots of moments and everybody should watch this movie its very amazing,Positive

I vaguely remember the time i watched this movie which was a long long time ago but i definitely remember being blown away by this masterpiece I would love to experience something similar again,Positive
I thought this movie was a seven average Ive seen better Jurassic Park movies fallen kingdom is better I thought that the storyline was a bit lazy but I quite enjoyed the way that this was presented I thought it was rushed other than that its a seven for me and thats being generous because I thought it was okay I didnt think it was pulling up trees I thought they would be a lot better than what it was I was quite disappointed to be honest I should rate it a little bit lower because the seven is being generous but I quite enjoyed it and it was okay I didnt mind it could be a lot better than what it was,Notr
The Emoji Movies concept was DOA but the movie brought in millions of dollars Dont be surprised if Emoji Movie  is announced OOF,Negative
Really disgusting movie is only barely acceptable on the first  minutes the remaining  minutes can be defined as glorified advertisingThe visuals are perhaps the only acceptable thing about this movie but who watch a movie expecting those to be good And if you do then there are countless films do it betterThe story progresses in a painfully slow way and is packed with filler what else did you expect they Have to make time for the perpetual advertising also is very inconsistent and full of plot holes and things just dont make senseThe characters are annoying and very few arent worth of hateMy most sincere condolences to the people paid the ticket price for a minute long ad,Negative
This movie is just simply a masterpiece amazing directing by Christopher Nolan best performance ever by heath ledger once you see this movie you will love it,Positive
What did I just see That was all that went through my mind after walking out of the theater with tears of blood streaming out of my eyes This diabolical misuse of CGI and AList talents is so evil that its hard to believe no one turned into a pillar of salt looking at it Like most real cats I just dont give a damn,Negative
I grew up watching Dragonball so I was looking forward to watching this filmI was very surprised that for a cartoon as big as Dragonball they only had YunFat Chow as a well known actor in the film Unfortunately besides YunFat Chow Justin Chatwin and Jamie Chung the rest of the cast look like the should be doing low budget Disney TV seriesStory line isnt very straight forward and you will probably need to watch it a couple of times to fully understand itThe one thing you can take from this film are the fighting scenes Better than I expected and well choreographed,Negative

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched themI didnt intend to see this movie at all I do not like prison movies and I dont normally watch them I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons she said to me Whenever I feel down or depressed I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better At the time I thought that was very strange One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already I remembered what she said so I watched it I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showingNo action no special effects  just men in prison uniforms talking to each other,Positive
This movies plot makes zero sense people go back and forth to far off locations in no time and also dinosaurs inconceivably show up in logistically illogical places They dumbed down the OG cast and gave them barely anything to do The whole movie is just a mix of predictable jump scares mixed with Fast and the Furious like action scenes that does nothing to the plot,Notr
Another miss for this otherwise great actor The story is interesting but delivery is below average for high budget and box office movie which is visible by overuse of CGI If the screenplay was more focused on troubled dr Morbius and let the actors do what they do best act that would certainly deliver the whole different movie With some movies its better not try to please all the audience some may be left to adults and not to cut all the blood and gore so the children can watch it That way you get sterile CGI movie but it still wont appeal to kids since they luckily still dont know the struggles about major life transformations and decisions which main character needs to endure There are some ok scenes and story is interesting so ,Notr
The biggest monstrosity of the year malformed and melted computer cats dancing via cgi with blurry legs and no feet its like they spend all the budget in the biggest and overrated stars like Taylor Swift and James Corden by the way the worst in this movie My God Andrew Lloyd Webber needs to sue universal for this garbage,Negative
This movie is both boring and rage inducing at the same time I with no exaggeration almost attempted suicide for the fifth time in the past year If you have considered seeing this movie ironically save your money The movie is so awful that it is generally unpleasant to view even ironically If you have a history of suicide I wouldnt risk going to The Emoji Movie as it might trigger an episode If youre a member of the target demographic for this film and are planning on going to see this movie re evaluate your life then promptly proceed to donate whatever money you were going to pay for your tickets to charity and take your family out for dinner at a nice restaurant,Negative
Absolutely terrible I could only sit through about  minutes,Negative
I know lots has been said about this film since it bombed at the box office then became a hit through video rental I am probably not going to add anything new I am a Stephen King fan and have a policy not to watch the films made from the books as they usually turn out to be quite dodgy However I was urged by a friend to give it a go and I was not disappointed This film is about hope and redemption and the characterisations are faithful to the original storyTim Robbins is perfect in the lead role quietly enigmatic just as I had pictured when reading the bookThe movie is quite old fashioned in concept but dont let this deter you You are taken through the whole spectrum of human emotions and end up feeling better because of watching it The relationship between the two lead men is charming and kind of restores your faith in human natureYou must watch this movie whether or not you have seen it before because it makes you feel goodThis film will end up being a perennial classic up there with the likes of its a wonderful life and the wizard of ozI cant think of a single criticism,Positive
Very badly acted  Mediocre score  Badly written characters  Some scenes are just watered out to make the movie longer ands its about an emoji Highly paid actors are just really bad in animated movies so just dont DO IT That is my very short remarks on the emoji movie and how terrible it really was  star,Negative
The only momment satisfied me was that seeing Dr Grant and Dr Ellie together again everything else just was unbearable the lazy scripting poorly written conversation overtheplace film flow lame music superhero character cliche action random  lack of coherent cut scences like you put all materials of JP  JW mix them all together and hope new movie finds a way No just same thing but different labelling number What is the good VFX for if the story does not tell the storyCould not belive they can do this to their fans Contradicting to the promise of the director this final chapter delivers nothing but disappointment and anger I respect the crew cast and all the efforts they put into making this but to me the movie is a flopWould not recommend to watch in theater Big no no,Notr

It is sad to see how poor in their essence story and execution the woke movies are I struggled to watch this to the end Same distorted narrative about negative vs positive characters that dont reflect any reality The old characters are lifeless and it is easy to see they dont believe in the plot I love Sam Neill acting but in this case it was pretty sad to digest his acting The same has happened to many classics like Starwars Matrix and others They became unwatchableWhere are the Hollywood movies of the th century that were positive optimistic full of life and fun to watch I am actually wondering for how long Hollywood can keep this up until money talks and revenues bite Good luck keeping the audience engaged with these fake stories,Notr
I cannot even comprehend all the negative reviews The animatronics are great and the singing and acting are pretty good Cmon we pretty much all know the story and what to expect THiS IS CUTEIf you dont already know the story well then the movie wont make the actual musicalstory any betterIf youve seen the actual musical or several times like I have then this is a pretty good representation,Negative
Almost never does a sequel surpass the hugely successful prequel well not for Nolan the Dark Knight surpasses its predecessor in narrative intensity thanks to the majestic interpretation of the masked heros number one enemy Heath Ledger aka Joker Good versus evil moral personality versus personmade immorality both at the limit in pursuing their purpose so distant yet so close Pure action spectacle special effects narration practically a perfect film a milestone to be left for future memory No Batman will ever be the same again and no Batman will ever be like this Truly sublime,Positive

I missed this movie to watch actually when it was released here Suddenly i came to watch this movie and i am sure it was one of the best movie of With Leonardo and Joseph this movie packs a whole bunch of entertainment The idea of such movie was never used before that makes it one of its kind I had to watch it  times to fully understand the movie lol the moments runs one by one and also the Visual effects are stunning never felt they were used thoughThe cast is perfect for the movie and it seems Christopher Nolan has improved to the last edgeA must watch movie and truly entertaining Thumbs up Worth every  you pay,Positive
I just saw The emoji movie and in my opinion it was a character driven masterpiece full of feeling and emotion that ranged the whole spectrum and the way the story tied together at the end pulling stuff from throughout really caught me off guard and shows good writing If you only see one movie this year make sure it is THE EMOJI MOVIE,Negative
The story doesnt make any sense Too much bland and unnecessary long runtime Its a just short  min movie The movie just looped the same  min again and again in different places Please showcase the hand of Chris Patt in the museum to stop tsunamis and any upcoming diseases Just show the hand and it will automatically solve all the problemsThe whole movie wasnt about dinosaurs its all about the stupid hand of Chris PattThe writer is confused about what to write for the movie Completely disaster Jurassic Park should stop and make the movie named  The problem Solver hand,Notr
Sony stick to phones and video games I cant help but feel like this is to sabotage Apple with a terrible movie Sony made  good movies Spider Man  and  and Spider Man homecoming This one is the worst one Even illumination animation is better because though the dont make the best movies you can somewhat know what they are just by looking at them Sonys single digit IQ doesnt allow them to do this so make a movie where the characters are emotions At least inside out does things to make them more complex than Hes happy make him a happy emoji Even Foodfight the terrible movie has characters creative ideas No animated movie is worse than this and this definitely made Steve Jobs roll over in his grave Dont see this movie unless you get to see it for free,Negative
I have literally just turned off the DVD player after watching this film for the very first and last time after so much hype I thought it was about time I sat all the way through it and did enjoy it but I really dont see what all the fuss is about Yes it is a good film yes it is a good plot However I had guessed the outcome and a few bits within the film before the flashback at the end and therefore for me there were no unexpected twists I wasnt even moved at the end In fact all in all I was a bit disappointed as my friends who have seen it said that they had cried and it was such a brilliant film Am I abnormal I think the green mile was better and I did cry at the end of that Im sorry if I upset any of you who think it is the best film ever but I dont,Positive

This movie was an okay film but it that great like the first original movie Dont get me wrong The Matrix is still a true classic compared to Keanu Reeves and CarrieAnne Moss performance from there previous films over the years after But for this year they still nailed there part as Neo and Trinity Even tho there getting a little older as you think Lana Wachowski involved with the fourth installment and tries to connect the story of how Neo and Trinity got resurrected and clearly not the exact story of what we think it is at some point Some people still enjoys the Matrix and some people are quite disappointed but Im not gonna give anything away,Notr
Thats how I felt throughout this whole films action sequences So messy so laughably bad SO MUCH POTENTIALIm not going to fart in its mouth too much because the concept I liked Morpheus I didnt and the story made sense I feel It was just a MESS NOISE AND LIGHTS The one thing that set matrix apart from all other modern a tion films was left in the toilet here and just had a smelly old mans toe stuck up its bumI truly believes theres  cut of this film that exists and its great Give us that We will payPs RIP Wilfred Brambell Legend,Notr

"Inception is such a film which was like Beyond my imagination
Cristopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors of all time undoubtedly The way he presented the story in this films was really praiseworthy Actually he does this in every of his films
Also the actors did a great job",Positive
This animated movie is SO UNDERRATED Before its release I remember saying what everyone else did Why are they making this movie I was so quick to judge based on other animated films and Hollywoods reputation of unnecessary movies Fast forward a couple years and I found this movie at my local library figured I would give it watch with the family We LOVED it This movie was so well written The animation was actually pretty good TJ Miller and James Corden were HILARIOUS together So many good things occurred that I cant believe how poorly reviewed Emoji Movie was If anyone rates this film lower than a  I think you may be biased by PixarDisneyDreamWorks expectations The Emoji Movie was different but it was definitely good,Negative
Its an emotional manipulation for dummies type of film with boring direction and cardboard characters Nice performances by the actors though some great moments but nothing outside the Hallmark meets Stephen King meets Prison feel of the entire movieI saw it one and a half times and would see it again only if I got paid for the troubleSimilarly I hated The Green Mile only later did I find out its the work of DarabontMy recommendation Skip this and go see OZ again,Positive
Its not that bad tbh maybe cause my expectation was super low and bad like I expect  and after I watch it it was not that bad it was ok but for me its kinda boring in the middle of the movie but ya the movie is still bad I love the VFX but I dont really like the slow mo in this movie it was like to much The acting was good but the story was to fast like they not explaining some scene like how morbius can fly at first he can fly cause theres train but in the final he was flying to find martine like how But ya the movie Credit scene was quite surprising me,Notr
There wasnt a red tread through the movie there was a ball of yarn that somebody had set on fireThere was points where we would laugh out loud not because of the comedy that was inserted into the movie but because of silly things on screen mistakes bad CGI and plotholes There is a moment in this movie where a helicopter disappears completely for like  min only to return right where it should have been all the time so it again can shoot at the main actors it made no sense but someone must have forgot it was there from the startLike I said this is more like a spoof movie of the Matrix it really has no connection that makes sense to the old movies and the story isnt moved forward in any meaningful way A hero journey is also only as good or interesting as the villain in the story and here they are all bad its more bad boys in a ally than a threat you feel could be a actual problem,Notr
I just watched Cats and after reading all these horrific views I dont get it It wasnt a great movie but it certainly doesnt warrant the level of vitriol that other reviewers have posted I saw the Broadway show many years ago and I dont see why the comparisons to it are so negative Also I find many of the negative reviews have a similar tone and verbiage as though they were written by a bunch of people sitting around brainstorming to see who could top each other with their insults of the movie I actually liked the sets and costumes I loved Dame Judy Dench as Deuteronomy and Sir Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat And Jennifer Hudson outdid herself once again I actually got chills when she sang the nd version of Memory,Negative
Strange and somewhat confusing tale on a group of individuals who can enter their dreams and those of others and manipulate them into reality A mission is undertaken by them that may be seriously undermined by their leaders personal dilemma Long but watchable this is an interesting modern effort on the Science Fiction genre and a breath of fresh air in contemporary cinema,Positive
I was waiting for this movies to release  did not get the chance to see it on the first day  got the tickets on the second day  going in to the theater my expectation were high and i have to say that Nolans did not disappoint me at all in fact Christopher Nolan and Leonardo Di Caprio has shown there class  All the side characters in the movie played there parts well  every actor suits the character they are playing u cant judge the coming scene and many times it will surprise you according to me this is the best movie of the year  Nolan n Leonardo has shown there class in there respective field  everything about this movie is refreshing and amazing The plot of the movie is planted well enough to keep u at your seats,Positive
The screen was cropped due to the aspect ratio I saw it in PVR India  not IMAXWell it starts from where they left in  The dinosaurs are living among the public throughout the world Making a place for themselves in the eco systemThey have a huge star cast especially from the Jurassic park franchiseIts one time watch with a predictable storyline and awful dialoguesYou must go with your lil oneskids or there is no adventure in it,Notr
The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face In fact the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes If there is any drawback to this movie it is that it is a shade too long meaning its often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV Rent this or better yet buy it to get the full thrust of it Definitely on my personal top ,Positive
This really is as bad as everyone says it is The story is awful the characters have no development the effects are shoddy and the action is boring and thats all without mentioning the actingTheres really nothing to redeem it but even that doesnt get across just how bad this is If you watch it your face will be stuck scrunched up in pain and disgust for the entire running time,Negative

Why JW Dominion is The worst JW ever The script is extremely weak Bring back the old character only for money Its so predicatablethere is moreThe only thing they care is add Lgbt character in storyi dont have problem with them but in every movie i recently watched they added by force even at the cost of destroying the story,Notr
Why are there so many low and negative reviews for this film I do not knowI think it is ridiculous how so many people rate it a one out of ten Like seriously some of you people who left such negative ratings could really not give it any more than one star I think rating this movie  is way too harsh and too poor It sort of says something about yourself if you rate this film only one star it means you just want to be so overly negative This filmmovie is a lot better than I actually like this film I have watched it and I think it is good how emojis were made into a movie which is obviously what this film isI did write this review mostly to say that I really disagree with all of the very low reviews mostly all of the  reviews as I said above,Negative
Well it was painfully long for such a short movie The numbers were good Taylor Swift was great as was Rebel Wilson It just needed maybe some more excitement or substance or something It just didnt move quick enough for me to enjoy it I kept wondering when and wishing for it to be over The acting was great This was all down to the script and editing,Negative
Wasted  hrs No story line Forced characters Doesnt make sense Revisiting old scenes were awful CGI is too game like I remember watching the st Jurassic Park as a kid and thought the T Rex was going to jump out of the screen Overall one of the worse movie Dont waste your time and money It felt like a money grab by these movie makers exploiting a good classic movie How much more can they milk this,Notr
I think the Candy Crush segment was probably the most insulting I mean they literally explain the rules of the game just so you know how to play when you hopefully download it after the film is overCome on,Negative
Christopher Nolan you never disappoint me With the dark knight and now this How does this guy do this Well first off inception takes you where no other film ever has One of the most original screenplays today The plot is simple the movie itself is so complex It is filled with action suspense and takes you a huge variety of places Usually in a movie theres a Climax or final showdown Where there is one thing or job left to do Those sequences usually last  minutes but here it take a good hour and a half This is a movie that will leave you thinking and talking Describing this movie is truly difficult because words cannot describe this masterpiece This is a must see movie and honestly one of the best movies that Ive seen to this day Inception sure as hell delivers,Positive

Batman Christian Bale joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon Gary Oldman and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes Maggie Gyllenhaal to fight the organized crime in Gothan City However chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker Heath Ledger that brings a wave of violence and murders The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan CityThe Dark Knight is a great surprise for a blockbuster with a solid and deep story great direction performances special effects and makeup The adventure is also dramatic with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics morality human nature hope and other important themes The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in TBag from Prison Break and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death In the end The Dark Knight is a great movie the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in  but the IMDb User Rating Top   is absolutely overrated ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDbs Rating but sometimes the truth is not good enough My vote is nineTitle Brazil O Cavaleiro das Trevas The Dark Knight,Positive
I think it wrapped up closure for other plot lines in the series that fans wanted to see It had similar scenes but those are to be expected in the franchise It was nostalgic and cool to see how they merged the two casts into a unified plot line Lots of action Wish it had more dinosaurs Some of it was predictable But I love the franchise and support it It was entertaining and I think everyone will have a different perspective of what they think would have made it better I am glad the original cast came back The acting was better than expected Scenes seemed to flow well It was high action at times,Notr
This is indeed one of the best prison dramas Ive ever seen Ive always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesnt let me down here But I cant believe this is so high in the overall list I would place it in the  range myself Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins The Player Short Cuts and Jacobs Ladder are all far better films It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me but since Im not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I cant explain why Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better Maybe its the American Factor what with me being English but the overrating of this film completely baffles me,Positive
I didnt have high expectations coming into this movie but when I left I decided this was one of the best films I had ever seen This is certainly Nolans best work The acting is exceptional the story line is mindblowing and the action is fantastic Nolans film kept me on the edge of my seat the entire  hours The last hour of the film has to be the greatest theater experience Ive ever had I saw Inception twice as I heard you will get more out of it the second time which was very true If you are unclear on some things the first time you see it go again Its even better the second time You will be thinking about this film days after you see it and probably have some very intense dreams ,Positive
The Emoji Movie is notorious for being awful And considering I love to occasionally watch an awful film in order to get a good laugh I decided to finally see this piece of dreck Overall it was a terrible movie but perhaps not as terrible as I expected It ended up being more tedious than painful to watchSo whats wrong with this movie The writing Despite the film being all about emojis the writers managed to hit every possible cliche a kids movie could use And considering these are emojis it just didnt make sense to stick so close to a rather overused formula Additionally the film had what seemed like hundreds of jokes relating to computers and social mediaand each and every one of them fell flat And several of these jokes involved the poop emoji This is because in none of these was there even a hint of humor or cleverness I noticed one review where the reviewer gives this one a  Thats like saying that a velvet Elvis painting belongs in the Louvre,Negative
I dont understand this dont they watch their own movie before release The script is bad director was worst editing tried to save some of it but no I will not watch this ever again I dont recommend it Dont waste your time or money go watch the first jurassic park again What a waste Fx are great but with that kind of money it has to be  nice moments cant save the film Why would you do this,Notr
Its a feelgood movie maybe not spot on like the original Dragon Ball Z that I grew up with but its worth the watch Goku is portrayed as he should clever witty humble and humorous The fight scenes are more realistic to the eyes rather than being fully edited with CGI and special effects The storyline and character development is wellpaced The only thing that was unsettling is the fact that Bulma looked exactly like Arianna Grande Overall Dragon Ball Evolution is humorous diverse and an enjoyable film in our modern times,Negative
Worth checking out Great closure to the series Dont listen to the critics just go and have a great time Loved that the old cast came back to join the new cast Well done everyone,Notr
Sadly its a level of a Marvel flickThe clue is there  one of a dialog line says Warner Bros will do a reboot of Matrix with original director  or without  Guess without it would be worse,Notr
Not for a reason But for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories Its themes the tension the moral questions the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation are bones of a splendid film A film who reminds more than presents Values roots of justice beauty of original source the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer Short  a film who must see,Positive
It was so bad that my wife came out of the theater in a really bad mood and we had a fight because of the bad tension Two hours full of action but still superficial and empty,Notr
Definitely not the worst movie I have ever seen in my life although it wasnt the best either The plot is one of the most overused and the jokes subpar but the characters were quite likable and the animation style was colourful and energetic which Sony is known to be like on Hotel Transylvania  Cloudy With A Chance Of MeatballsWould be enjoyed more by younger childrenOverall Id give it a ,Negative

this move is the most wonderful move I have ever seen I strongly advice the lovers of movies to watch it  its contain the action adventure  and mystery features  This move considered as the second film of the batman trilogy or the dark knight trilogy   i advice the people to watch all the film series   the events of the move are interesting  u cant feel of Boredom when u watching it  the actors and the actress of the dark knight film are so smart and talented  u will have the image this move is realistic and not just a move  Christian Bale  Heath Ledger  Morgan Freeman  Maggie Gyllenhaal Aaron Eckhart  all of them have the talents and strength to be engaged in this move  and Im the big fan of their movies and Their business films  the story of the film its about the evil is founded every where and the good will have the victory at last ,Positive
Its a generic hollywood blockbuster Like the other  movies before The story in all movies people running away and hide from dinos Thats all Why do we watch this We want to see many perfect created dinosaurs You will get many this time The story is stupid of course But its not an arthouse movie,Notr
This is a fantastic entry into Christopher Nolans trilogy Have watched this probably around  times over the past  years and it never gets boring,Positive
The movie grabs you from the start keeps your attention on the screen so good that you dont even want to blink and as every good movie does leaves you with many whatifs and questions about real lifeThe movie has a lot of action with scenes developing in various places from ordinary city streets to high snowy mountainsThe details and presumably hidden messages keep the viewer focused and able to not only see the picture but also to feel the plot itselfI would say that the back story of the characters could have been explained a bit more extensive but nevertheless it is clear enough for the viewer to create their own idea of the characters personalities and motives One of the things that grabbed me was the way the end leaves the viewer with so many questions and possible interpretations that the whole internet exploded with discussions after the movies premiere,Positive
What I can say is this is a really great movie It tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope You will succeed in the end And also be ready at any timeMaybe it is because of language problem I dont grasp it very well in the beginning But step by step I understand it And in the end I understand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that doesnt happened in the movies I have ever seen in the past And also the performance skill is another thing I like it They are good actors And this is the movies that seldom take manwomen sensation as topic but still give people good feelingsGreat movie encourage you while entertaining you,Positive
I am writing this review as I am still in the movie theatre room and the movie isnt finished yetThe most disturbing thing for me is how obvious the green screen is I cant stop starring at their feet They didnt even try to make it look a little real No depth of fiel nothing This just makes all the dancing and moving so unnaturalSome songs and voices are good but the overall movie is just really bad I wanted to leave after min but my mom paid for the tickets and I dont want to be disrespectfulI dont think this should have ever been adapted for the big screen Because of all the reasons above but I also think its just too theatrical and just doesnt adapt well I have no doubt this would be x more enjoyable played on a Broadway stageStay away from this movie,Negative

Ive never done a review before so be gentle but having attended the Irish premiere of Inception last night I felt compelled to write and tell people to go and see this movie If you only see one picture all year make sure this is itAs people have stated dream movies have been done before however not with this style and complicated simplicity youll understand what I mean when you see itThe acting by everyone is first rate if the emotional story of Cobb and Mal wasnt believable then the film would fall asunder however Di CaprioCoitillard carry it off to perfection Everyone else in the ensemble cast is terrific with particular mention to Tom Hardy get this guy more workUnlike many reviewers I didnt find the story difficult to follow although rapt attention is essential and Nolan has delivered a story which doesnt attempt to talk down to you as I felt with the Matrix instead it draws you in and delivers in the last hour probably the finest piece of film making Ive ever seenThe end of the movie was met with rapturous applause and I realized my hands were shaking I had tears running down my face and sweat running down my back Truly outstanding stuff Christopher Nolan youre a genius,Positive
This movie is easily one of the greatest movies of all time The Shawshank Redemption is an adaptation of Stephen Kings novella titled Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption This movie is truly a masterpiece with the perfect casting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman The lessons you learn the emotions that were touched the friendships that were made and overall the redemption that every character got in their own way is what made this movie special This movie teaches you about hope and institutionalization which means being stuck in one place for so long that its all you ever know It shows the darkness about being in prison In conclusion this movie is a  Hands down one of the greatest movies ever and Ill definitely rewatch it in the future,Positive
Never underestimate Hollywoods ability to take something phenomenal and cherished and suck the life out of it for money The dinosaurs felt more like window dressing than the focus Disjointed impossible to keep up with or care about the myriad of story lines Actually walked out with  minutes left because the ending is just a conclusion to a ridiculous dumpster fire,Notr

When I seen this movie in Top I could not believe it thought it was a joke It is probably some boring old movie maybe even without colors But I was amazed Similar to Prison Break series just older version of it Adventure Lesson Inspiration Motivation Insight Experience Confidence Emotionsall in one Good ending too It lacks nothing It teaches us to fight for freedom and not just ordinary freedom like from prisons or psych wards but freedom from people diseases poor life anything negative or bad It gives insight into feeling of being released from some institution for those who have not experienced it,Positive

The Dark Knights alleys covered in the shadow needles and trash on the pavement and lunatic clown blowing up half of the city is all i was expecting from the film portraying BatmanJoker relationship Heath Ledgers role is making me anxious and thats a proof of well played character He is unpredictable brutal and savage just mental It may not be the Joker we know from the comics but for me its the best version of the Clown we ever saw on screen Usage of the darkness and shadow is what others cantake example from The movie has a good pace there is a lot of actiongoing on but it isnt too much It is a perfect balance between action and dialog which is hard to obtain Overall it is definitelly the best Batman movie ever made,Positive
The storyline is a cliche but I still liked it I really liked HI with his annoying character and they cast a great voice for smiler It was okay to watch but I will not watch it again,Negative
The only reason to see this movie is to say you saw the worst movie of the decade that managed to come out only  days before that new decade,Negative
A very very very brilliant film The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as always The script was amazing along with the directing The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart It makes you care about criminals The score is also very goodIts an enthralling piece of cinema and just Amazing Id recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal just look at A Clockwork Orange,Positive
I have no idea who these people are that are giving bad reviews but Im assuming individuals that have a purpose rather than ones that have seen this movie It was absolutely adorableI went with my  year old grandson and my daughter All three of us loved the movie Taking the enthusiastic applause from both young and old at the end of the movie Im assuming the same holds true for at least most of the rest of the audience The few reviews I read seemed to want to find some deep meaning in this cute little cartoon If they just watched the movie for the fun hourish it is rather than getting into their own minds the reviewers might have had a fun time Dont go expecting anything other than a cartoon fun time as that is what it is As that was what we were looking for we had a perfect evening at the movies with this movie,Negative

Was really looking forward to this film had a lot of potential but it wasnt anywhere near the expectations Matt Smith was the light of the film Wasnt the worst film but it wasnt the best film Ive ever seen,Notr
This Batman installment isnt a bad one its just been completely overrated since the passing of Heath Ledger Secondly there was way too much material to be packed into the three hours alloted If anyone knows anything about the back story of Harvey DentTwo Face they are just left feeling empty and the character itself unjustified I understand Nolan was trying to do something different with the Joker but why disrespect Two Face Also there was really no BatmanBruce Wayne complex which I enjoy and feel is important to every Batman film Overall a good action film but will not be adding to my Batman movie collection Hopefully Nolan brings back Two Face in the next film and gives him a face,Positive
Watched it for the the first time In order to enjoy this movie you need to be prepared You need to be focused and pay attention or else you will get lost You also have to be patient You needs these things to really understand this movie because this film can get overwhelming There is a lot of going on and can be overwhelming Normally when I sit down and watch a movie I like to relax on my couch and will probably check me phone in the beginning until it reall catches my attention With this movie you cant do that You need to fully pay attention and it lowkey felt like I was forced to watch it because of how much focus you need to watch this film I feel like a great movie shouldnt be that hard to watch This is why I take some points off the rating Other than that the movie is good and I understand why people give it a ,Positive
First of all not as bad as I thought it would be I actually waited an entire year before finally watching it I am a huge fan of dragonball and dragonball Z and from beginning to end of this movie it brought me back to the original characters and series that I loved I wish it had more fight scenes with powers but they did a good job putting everything together Also the plot followed the series well with only a few minor changes Overall this movie was highly enjoyable and I look forward to a possible sequel You can tell the director really watched the show and enjoyed it each character in the movie have the same essence as the cartoon characters,Negative

This movie is everything I expected it to be loud dumb and over the top action packed I was neutral about this movie its so bad that its almost good What definitely worked for this movie was bringing back characters from the original films I enjoyed seeing Neil and Dern along side Dallas and Pratt as well as the newcomers Wise and Athie However a lot didnt work like the storyline Its generic and I expected much more The dinosaurs are almost an after thought in this storyline placed second to gigantic locusts yes silly I know Not horrible but wasted opportunity I would have preferred the movie expanding on humans living with dinosaurs in a modern world and exploring the moral and ethical debates that go along with it It briefly touched on that but didnt dive in before creating some bogus plot about a corporation out to disrupt the food chain Could have had some thought provoking yet terrifying and majestic scenes instead of the over utilized evil corporation tries to take over the world plot,Notr

I have decided that just because the media and public say that a movie is terrible that you should still see it for yourself Both this movie and Madame Webb were so harshly dragged by the public that I decided not to see them Until recently when I had my sisterinlaw in town and we were binge watching movies that were on our list to see but had been rated badly so we were holding off While watching this movie we kept looking at each other wondering why people hated this movie so much Just like Madame Webb it was a superhero movie that held our attention had us rooting for the superhero and hating the villain Maybe were just not that picky and can be easily entertained But I would say to anyone who likes superhero movies I recommend they watch it Then go watch Madame Webb because I also recommend that one,Notr

Every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that it is my favorite movie of all time But certainly as entertaining a film that it is being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it a great film or dare I saythe greatest film ever madeBut what then makes a film great First and foremost if it sets out to entertain the general public it must do that and Shawshank certainly does that Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its inclusion in the great IMDb greatest movie debate The serious nature of its central plot pointsa wrongly convicted murderer who assists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escapeis contrasted by some truly funny scenes Although by no means a comedy the splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog Theres nothing fancy about this filmno special effects spectacular scenery or even a bunch of pretty women No its just the telling of a story mostly through the narration of Morgan Freemans character Red that almost lulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to happen here But after all of the subtle plot twists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like Im actually sharing in Andys redemption Now if that isnt what they teach in Filmmaking  then they should just close up the classroomUltimately there cannot be a single motion picture that is the greatest film of all time because as art and in an art form as varied as cinema greatness must be measured by each individual Greatness as beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder But in this beholders eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film I have ever seen,Positive
This film is terribly underrated Id say it goes to par with art films such as The Genius of Synedoche The movie has many layers and causes many emotions Happiness sadness nerve the whole nine yards Gene is deeply emotional and that plays a big role in The Emoji Movie The embarrassment Alex feels in the real world shows Genes true inner torment Theres also an underlying theme of the DABDA scale where Gene seems to be going through all  stages Its hard to put everything into words because this movie is so impressive for being for kids Hes clearly going through so much and i will continue to analyze this film further on later watches I appreciate the time and effort put into creating this film Sony has created a true masterpiece,Negative
I tried to watch this in a theater when it came out and fell asleep I finally got thru it many years later Idk I loved Interstellar thought it was fantastic but this was super boring I should have liked it I just didnt and I cant explain why Seems like the writers and such just tried to hard,Positive
The classic can be recalled repeatedly Andy is full of yearning for life and freedom To get out of prison is a new life for him and red who has been used to prison life has become numb To get out of prison is death for him,Positive
While the idea of an emoji movie is pretty silly the introduction with the introduction of the characters is still interesting Associating a lot of images with something that is nothing more than a series of jokes requires a certain intelligence and ingenuity A emoji with greater capacity than the rest must face the challenge of discovering himself while joining other emojis that have certain interests Finally an evil corporation that directs the destiny of emojis is challenged to put control of the situation lest something finally get out of control There are references to multiple applications and programs which would charm someone born in this century There are a couple of great moments dancing is one of them and the movie whether the perfectionists like it or not isnt that bad,Negative
Inception might have been a better movie  and would certainly have been more entertaining  had writerdirector Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire  running time explaining itself to its audienceSeriously the exposition Never Stops There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character which of course was a hamfisted way of explaining it to us But even with all of that aggressive exposition the movie never does make a lot of sense The result is a lot of busyness  oh theres always plenty of stuff going on  thats nevertheless pretty boring because its never clear what all of the busyness is forNolan has done this to us before Who the hell came out of The Prestige with any clue what that movie was about And even his more narratively coherent films like The Dark Knight suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises cant support Inception is no exception ha The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junkGrade C,Positive
I know that other peoples votes shouldnt influence mine either waybut geez No of all time What are the IMDb demographics that create that overblown resultI thought this was a very entertaining movie somewhere around  points But the script is kind of sugary and the characters lack the subtlety you would expect in a truly great drama The ending reminded me of The Great EscapeThere are several good performances that arent quite able to shake loose the limitations of the script and become stirringCute but not the greatest prison drama ever I think there must be a lot of teenagers voting on IMDb,Positive
When I thought Nolan could not outshine himself I watch Inception This is not only a masterpiece of filmmaking but a journey to a place you dont want to leave One hour after watching it I am not able to fully describe what Ive seen heard and felt Its absolutely essential for your life to watch this movie Once you watch it you will experience pure genius from an author when trying perfection and joy when you feel he made it The cast action music effects plot and subtext are combined in a way most directors only can dream of Nolan has proved once again that quality intelligence and talent can also work in mainstream industry From this moment on most films will be boring simple and not worth watching That only happens when you reach pure happiness Thank you Mr Nolan culture and cinema are richer because of you and so are our lives If this man does not get an Oscar award the world is definitely doomed to ignorance and therefore to an end,Positive
This movie had everything an amazing movie consists of  a compelling plot a strong bond being built between the characters and a plot twist that will take your breath away Prepare to be moved as you witness a movie which shows the true side of institutionalism at prison  but also where the underdog perseveres against the challenges of life and overcomes hardships The ending will leave you content giving you a newfound sense of fulfillment and an appreciation for your life No matter how many times I watch this movie it always moves me as it did the first time I watched it Truly a masterpiece that needs to be witnessed all around the world,Positive
I saw this movie on a bootleg Best decision I ever made I can sum up the movie in  words tacky corny and confusing all in the extreme The story was sloppy the characterization absolutely ridiculous The only thing I liked about the movie was when it ended I hear  year old kids love this movie and that just appalls me I do NOT want the next generation watching this movie and thinking that this is what dragon ball is about What we need now is a Reboot like with the Hulk with a different director and better writers I think the cast could have done a good job it was just the story script and directingNot to mention special effectsThat really screwed the movie over If you want to be original learn from movies like transformers and especially Casino Royale Casino Royale because it is an original story that that is executed in a way that stays faithful to the novel keeping the characters largely the same and keeping the basic and important concepts of the novel,Negative

The Shawshank Redemption is a true masterpiece and a genius work of cinematic excellence It is a true testament to human will friendship and determination Quite possibly the greatest film ever made The clashing themes of evilness and goodness within the prison system makes this film the compelling and satisfying story it entails,Positive

I need not brag much about His Highness Christopher Nolan any more Everybody knows hes an out of the box genius And if anyone has a doubt go watch Inception right this moment Its meant to be watched at least twice The first time it just gives you a glimpse of his work And when you watch it the next time you can actually pause to appreciate each and every minute detail of his Masterpiece Meanwhile you cannot ignore other significant stake holders of brilliance Hans Zimmer and Di Caprio Now this is what you call Awesome Background Score I can bet hes given out his all The last time i saw Di Caprio he was still a kid And look what that kid has grown to become THE Dom Cobb Hats off for his on screen performance In nutshell i just hope that Inception doesnt become Nolans ONLY Masterpiece The Benchmark for a Perfect Blockbuster has just been raised  Go figure out for yourself,Positive
I too was first confused when I first saw this movie Its horrific Its terrible Its down right creepy at times And then I realized its just under the wrong genreCats is the best psychological thriller of our timeThe plot focus around a ritualistic killing in a cult from the point of view of a new comer and through glitchy special effects and just straight weird mumbogumbo becomes one of the best psychological thrillers of our time,Negative

Where to beginJared Leto and Matt Smith They both did a fantastic job in this movie Giving us a story of what lengths brotherhood can go while discovering what lengths they were willing to go to survive It was terrifying visually beautiful to the eyes and the fight scenes were amazing People just love hating on it because of Jared Leto give it a break people He is actually a good actor I would gladly see this movie again just to please my eyes and mind again And also those two end credit scenes gave my heart a jump for what the future of Jared Letos Morbius is yet to come,Notr
A really lacklustre experience Ive never seen the cartoon and dont plan to but watched the movie with an open mind The digital effects for one werent great though not terrible either the fight choreography and editing though doesnt work in many scenes and comes off as incredibly cheesy Its not particularly well acted either with some very bad line delivery The setting of the movie was very confusing too it clearly starts in the USA yet suddenly theres an environment with loads of Lava and martial arts culture what Also are the characters meant to be travelling too and if so how Even the costumes arent any good and many of the high school students look older than me Characters are not properly set up or introducd either the villain is dull and the ending cringeworthy Im not outraged by the movie though theres a few bits of humour a fairly fun tone and a brisk pace but it also leaves a lot to be desired,Negative
This movie is fking trash It took one of the greatest anime series and straight up butchered itIve seen porn with better acting Nothing was anime accurate it felt like the writers smoked some crack did some molly and jerked eachother off while writing this scriptIf you want to suffer watch it If you love yourself do literally anything else,Negative
The movie lacks a lot of elements from the beginning it is highly predictable and with a few plot holes If you dont pay attention to some details which are not obvious andor entirely clear in my opinion due to lazy writing or directing you will end up confused by the end of the movie,Notr
The films been IMDbs  for as long as I can remember That doesnt really raise my expectations considering I dont agree with so many inclusions or exclusions I thought this was absolutely fantastic Yes its pretty sentimental in a big way but unlike that years Best Picture winner it tells a captivating simple yet intriguing story that manages to earn its emotion with some really heartfelt characters and superb writing Its hard to hold anything against it if you liked it of course when its so unpretentious and gentle Freeman is fantastic unsurprisingly but Tim Robbins is so bloody brilliant in this Watching Rectify now Aiden Young seems to be playing in the same ballpark in terms of the similarity in his portrayal,Positive
The Emoji Movie is one of the most hated films in modern cinema And boy I can totally see why Im not saying this is the absolute worst movie Ive ever seen oh believe me I have seen WAY WORSE but this is still a horrible animated film The writing is absolutely awful Its like they didnt even TRY to put any sort of effort in the script Its an obvious ripoff of  animated films MUCH better than this film WreckIt Ralph The LEGO Movie and Inside Out The characters are unlikable and very meanspirited while others are just dull and forgettableThe visuals were okay but other than that The Emoji movie is a heap of unoriginality and is just plain awful Do not watch this movie All those little criticisms youve been hearing about this film are correct Avoid at all costs,Negative

Inception takes the concept of dreaming and turns it into a movie however its not done as creatively as something like eternal sunshine of a spotless mind Looking past that there was good potential for character development but really the only character who even feels remotely developed is the main one I was loving the first minutes of this movie but after it explained all the rules instead of doing something creative with it it just squared it literally dreams within dreams within dreams And Inception turned out to be nothing but an OK action movie that found legit excuses to make half the footage in slow motion In addition i did despise how the hype with the main characters wife was set up for some epic encounter and then rewarded our attention with just a melodramatic conversation in the end On the other hand it did offer some splendid effects but like all movies with such effects they have nominal value and as time passestheir real value diminishesThis movie deserves a  and nothing more,Positive
Epic finale for the Jurassic Park franchise Everyone has their opportunity to shine in this romp of a movie Couple characters from the last movie fell by the wayside which is understandable given the triumphant return of the original cast Viceral action sequences The cgi was great Loved the scale of this movie as everything comes full circle I really enjoyed it,Notr

It was awful I was prepared for the worsed and I think that you should rate movies on the category in which they are made So you cant say Transformers  was bad because it wasnt all bad it was okay in its own category But Dragonball Evolution was just all bad acting was terrible special effects were okay but not something for a manga spin off more something for a action movie and this shouldnt have been an action movie but more a manga I can understand that the story had to be modified but in this case the totally murdered it add extremely bad directing bad acting and semi good effectswhich are extremely bad if you reckon they had a  million budget and this movie goes into my worsed movies ever right alongside A View From The Top Movies after which you get the urge to kill yourself Go watch it but keep in mind you will waste  minutes of your life,Negative

Due to this film being one of the first films being filmed in lockdown it really wasnt that bad I felt the dialogue was a bit messy especially when Alan Grant and Ellie are speaking with the antagonist at the beginning However there were some good scenes but again like most films it was in the trailer Apart from that the detail on the dinosaurs is astonishing and where there is action there really isnt anything wrong with itSlow beginning and an alright ending I would recommend watching it though,Notr
First when I saw how huge the overall rating  was I wondered why But then I told myself I should give it try and truly it was totally worth it period I miss this kind of movies sush a masterpiece it contain many lessons and significances about our life Im still wondering how this masterpiece didnt win a oscar then I figured out that it is a small thing comparing this movie and if you dont watch it yet then you have miss a big part from your life,Positive
I knew it I knew it The first time I heard that Hollywood was going to make a liveaction version of one the most popular Japanese action animation series I was very sceptic Because I know how most of the big film companies work They want to make something that appeals to a large audience so they can cash in on the profits In doing that they always destroy the purity of the original story I know that sacrifices have to be made Not everything from the DBZ world can be put in a live action movie but common Why did have to make such a dumb movie with so much clichs Goku a high school teenager with teenage problems He gets trained by his grandfather in martial arts UuuhmKarate Kid anyoneThis movie sucks so much that I can write pages full of bad comments about it Instead of that Ill urge everyone to watch the following youtubeclip which expresses precisely what my feeling are about this movie httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvaVnIRfYJWXWatch it and spread this clip if your are also disappointed in this movie adaption,Negative

I always hear about this movie from my friends for example or even from people in social media but I didnt give it a chance now I feel some regret that I didnt watch it with my friends this movie is incredible and make you think about how if its happened in real life  in the end this movie worth the time I spent watching it,Positive
Super blown away by Inception I cant get over how Christopher Nolan can keep topping himself with each flick At first I was so scared to see this fail because of the curse of the stellar cast but i should have had faith in Nolan all along This is just unbelievably good He takes his time telling such a complicated story without dumbing it down or complicating it too much All the actors play their parts well that even Leo DiCaprio in a rare way fades into the character and you forget his celebrity Everyone and everything is just amazing from the ominous soundtrack to the sets to the acting and cinematographyall I could say at the end of the flick was WOW,Positive
Shame that the trailer looked great but nothing really happened,Negative
Whoever made the brilliant decision to give the keys to the Jurassic franchise to Colin Trevorrow and to let him write all three of these atrocities should be firedIts actually shocking how they are doing exactly what the original film was against Also bringing back the original cast just so the masses will go I remember that and clap like the morons they are is exactly what is wrong with Hollywood films todayThese producers Were So Preoccupied With Whether Or Not They Could They Didnt Stop To Think If They Should,Notr
It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating it is quite literally breathtaking What can I say that hasnt said before Not much its the story the acting the premise but most of all this movie is about how it makes you feel Sometimes you watch a film and cant remember it days later this film loves with you once youve seen it you dont forgetThe ultimate story of friendship of hope and of life and overcoming adversityI understand why so many class this as the best film of all time it isnt mine but I get it If you havent seen it or havent seen it for some time you need to watch it its amazing ,Positive
I dont like DBZ at all so when I was on a  hour plane ride to Greece I thought I could enjoy this as a dumb action movie I was wrong I couldnt get through  minutes of this garbage fire I even tried watching it with the volume off so I can ignore the horrible dialogue but I still couldnt get throught it No joke I just decided to stare at a black screen for about a half hour until I fell asleep on the plane,Negative
With all the big budgets and technology Hollywood can get what did we the audience get Many sequels And I dislike Dark Knight being just a little better sequelSince the Matrix was released more than  years ago what did we the SciFi film fans get compared with a decade or two before that Chris Nolan delivered on these two accounts and fewer and fewer directors in Hollywood can really master in commanding a complicated project and a good story telling at the same time I want more films like Inception coming to theaters here which spent a lot of money making one as well as taking us to experience something other media such as TV games cant offer That is what we trade for paying the ticket to get in a theaterThere is also a philosophical angle for the audience I think When we moviegoers are used to be overpowered by technology hard to distinguish among themselves like computer graphics animation special effects  unavoidably we find ourselves attracted to those with a FORM standing out among all on top of such as acting of any particular roles words of power of any particular scenes FORM of this film will be something many to follow If the derivatives of FORM to this film lead to a new spectrum for film makings then that will be something interesting for us movie lovers to know firstThe only thing I dont get it though  why did Saito and Fischer not recognize each other when they both waked up in the airplane Arent they supposed to know each other being major competitors in the business they are respectively in,Positive
I read the reviews of this film and thought I would never watch this film as the reviews were terrible and my sister convinced me to go and watch this I was dreading it however I came out of the screen thinking those terrible reviews were pretty terrible themselves as I laughed quite a few times and enjoyed this film so ignore negative reviews and take your kids to go and watch this film you will be surprised,Negative
The storyline seemed like a below par story written by an inexperienced writer It lacked depth and the film seemed too rushed The character development couldnt progress because the film skipped major scenes The film was easy to watch and the cinematic effects were well developed There seems to be several hit and miss with Marvels recent films especially when introducing new characters,Notr
It seems like Jared Letto has an uphill battle for positive reviews no matter what he does The guys a superstar Yeah I know he thought he should have played thr joker and that annoyed people but to be honest Morbius was a decent film I rate it better than the nd Venom for sure The CGI was great and not as over the top as other reviews may say I do wonder if this was originally slated for a D release as it would make sense for all the effects surrounding the action scenes Im pretty picky and judgy and was put off reading the negative reviews but I was pleasantly surpriseded after seeing the film,Notr
I wont go into details this movie was incredibely underwhelming and the plot is terrible There are some good cinematic shots and the old jp crew is back this is all I can say positively Every part of the movie is just a huge miss and zero satisfaction I wont spoil it but lets just say the Giga scenes are terrible literally acts like its blind or just doesnt know what he wants to do,Notr
CGI mess of a movie with caterwauling stars in ugly costumes and abysmal dance numbers based on the hit Broadway musicalThe movie is ugly to look at and is an assault on the ears with Jennifer Hudson screaming at the top of her lungs and every other singer shown in loving closeup as they mug through their numbers This includes Judi Dench Ian McKellen James Corden Rebel Wilson Taylor Swift and othersReally I thought Hudson was trying to cough up a hairball She should have It would have been the highlight of the film,Negative
Im shocked this is rated so poorly The movie was enjoyable and fun and great for kids Was this a dramatic masterpiece sure to win awards No Of course not it was not intended to be that sort of movie It is the story of a broken emojis quest to become unbroken He must journey through different apps on the phone in order to reach the cloud On this journey we get to see an imaginative view of what different apps could look like if the were real It is pretty clever really The Emoji Movie is full of humor the joke about the elderly is HILARIOUS and it has Steven Wright voicing the main characters father I think this movie is definitely worth watching if you have kids Theyll love it and I would think the parents would enjoy it too,Negative
Decent enough watch probably wont watch again and cant recommend if youre a fan of Dragon BallI was so conflicted after watching this that I binged all  seasons of Dragon Ball subtitled just to compare it to the source material and this movie is full of message redactedIf I had never heard of anime then this would actually stand on its own just fine It has a stellar cast YunFat Chow Justin Chatwin Emmy Rossum and Jamie Chung good production value energy attacks and action and a relatively good story lineHowever being a fan of the anime this comes dangerously close to being Avatar in its level of infidelity This would have been a great story to put into the Dragon Ball universe but you have to use different charactersIll avoid going on in great detail about everything it left out and just say that its a problem in the design of the movie it wasnt meant to be condensed into one movie its a series for a reasonGive it a watch itll either be a good time or itll at least get your blood pumping a bit,Negative
I really dont know why this movie got so much hate the characters were lovable the acting was great and the fighting scenes was enjoyable Maybe its because Im easily pleased when it comes to films overall it was interesting and really entertaining to watch I think if the film was made to win the hearts of the viewers they wouldve went above and beyond with the affects and all,Negative
Always love seeing Matt Smith Jared Harris and Al Madrigal but apart from them doing really with very little this was really poorI think Mark Kermode was absolutely right Matt Smith should have been the lead role I want Al Madrigal in cinemaIt was too dark The visual effects were a poor spin on The Matrix with disorientating focus reminiscent of the worst Michael Bay stylingThe story was wasnt very interesting The vampires didnt even look as good as Buffy The Vampire SlayerThe first maybe ten minutes made a familiar but not unwelcome attempt to ground the transformation with scifi detailing but it farcically descended in to fantasy in a way that way really jarring If it had the humor and fun of a usual Marvel outing maybe this would have been fine but with its self serious tone it just came off as lazyI really dont even think die hard Marvel and comic book fans would be in to thisIt did make want to watch Blade though to take the taste away,Notr
When me and my friend watched this movie we both physically ascended to heaven Everything about this movie is amazing As sincere movie lovers both of us ended up screaming crying throwing up at the beauty of the movie It was as if the characters were video game characters which had their emote keys stuck Every second is thrilling If I could personally meet Gene and ask him to marry me I would Jailbreak does not deserve him as much as I do And the amount of advertising makes you think that its just an hour and a half ad but youd be wrong It should be among the greats like Avatar and titanic,Negative
I pride myself on being nuanced I honestly believe everything has its weak and strong points But not this abomination of a filmThe story itself is unbelievably hollow and they filled that void with shameless recycling of the Matrix trilogy and constant empty repetitive dialogues between forgettable characters Everything else to the story was random farfetched and confusing It almost felt like a movie made by a youtuber with some Keanu Reeves cameos They not only did injustice to the trilogy the characters actually mocked it openly with the tons of sarcasm in referral to the first Matrix moviesZero love and talent went into this The most obvious cashgrab I haver ever seen  they have no shame I still cant believe it First review ever just to fulminate and ventGo watch it Do it See for yourself how low a director can stoop,Notr
It is an embarrassment to call this a movie This was so bad Started off in Textopolis which already sounds bad but it gets worse Then he meets some hacker and goes on an over dramatized quest to become a real emoji In other words its literally some idiot trying to fit in The ending was super predictable but if you actually want to see it get it off of one of those free movie websites,Negative
Jared Leto did great becoming Morbius With that being said the movie is boring Would like to see more of Jared as Morbius but with a different director Still the movie is perfectly watchable,Notr
 hour and minutes of my life I will now be getting back Even my children were disappointed For the cast of big names I was expecting something spectacular but instead it was one of the worse films I have ever seen,Negative
This is the best superhero movie ever made If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch thisHowever I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie If you dont like superhero movie but want to watch a good dramaaction movie then this is one of the best,Positive
It seems like theyre running out of ideas to make new movies in the franchiseThe movie itself is a good entertainer with very well directed thrill sequences like the chases and human interactions with the mighty predators In that sense it a very good watchWhat one may be disappointed with is the story line as there is hardly anything novel to offer They tried to cash in the following of Sam Neill and Laura Dern but that doesnt help beyond a pointI would still recommend it to watch for the execution brilliance of whatever they had on their plate,Notr
The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly the best best movie ever The Oscars biggest mistake was giving Forrest Gump the awards that Shawshank deserved Not to take credit from Forrest Gump which is also an amazing movie but it just cant compare to Shawshank Morgan Freeman arguably delivers his best performance and Tim Robbins gives a performance that I feel is greatly underrated and also deserved an Oscar nomination The films art direction adds to the storys beauty and gives off a feeling that fills you with hope I remember seeing The Shawshank Redemption on sale for  at WalMart and thinking I heard this is good so I bought it Little did I know the film was worth more than gold I bought the film and put off watching it for a couple weeks not overly anticipating watching it but finally decided to watch it when I was bored I am a gigantic movie buff and have so many movies its almost pathetic but The Shawshank Redemption changed my entire view of film Now every time I watch a movie I cant help but think It cant beat Shawshank Some people say that this movie is overrated but thats wrong Shawshank is an actual work of art to be compared with works of DaVinci and Picasso When people say this movie makes them cry they dont mean to say its so sad but that they didnt know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen I believe that if everybody sees only one movie during their life it should be this one See it now After that IMDb will seem like a whole new website because every film will seem like a different movie It is by the very definition of the word magnificent,Positive
So Im starting to come around on The Dark Knight I now think its pretty good When I first watched it I didnt like it at all Then I watched it again and liked it a bit better Now I think its good or could even be very goodIm finally starting to understand Heath Ledgers Joker performance I now think its great I think the point is that it is such a facade it leaves you wondering what is behind that facade and then you realise theres nothing there That is what makes the performance so terrifying The Joker IS the mask Who is wearing itA criticism I have now heard from a few people about this movie  a movie nobody dared to criticise for years  is that there should have been only one villain Joker was enough I now feel inclined to agree Harvey Dent is a great character but TwoFace feels unnecessary His descent into bad guy mode after being a true hero also feels unwarranted Such a massive turnaround probably needed a whole movie to explain Instead TwoFace gets Jokers leftoversI also feel the movie was too long I often lost interest toward the end,Positive
Like a lot of people didnt really seem an interesting title when it was released WHOA This is a movie that I know Ive watched the most number of times than any other movie Fantastic movie,Positive
I watched this movie  times within a week and every time I loved the movie even more everything in this movie is great great concept great acting great score I think it will be awhile until I see a movie that tops this for me,Positive
Its weird that the movies main character is the Meh Emoji and so so fitting Its a pretty formulated movie about an emoji who does not just want to be one thing and goes on a journey though a kids phone to prevent from getting deleted for being able to do multiple faces The movie is somewhat satire on social media apps and how we communicate with one another these days  I did like one part in which a teacher is teaching kids about hieroglyphics the original emojis All the big names like face book and Instagram make an appearance in the film There were a few big laughs in the movie Its one of those things where there making fun of one of the apps and if you use that app or understand how its used than it will give you a chuckle but man its so funny how the film is as lackluster as the emoji they picked as the main character Hollywood needs some new ideashttpcinemagardenscom,Negative
Probably yes acting was good plot brilliant I mean Stephen King wrote the book but it cant match the film When I sow this movie I thought thats it this is it best movie ever Sure you can find people who didnt like it and when I ask why and try to guess what then happened They just confused themselves they can say reason why they dont like this movie When I try to read comments with  star I cant find comment with good reasons that could make me realize that this movie is a bad movie If there is no reason then this means that its the best movie ever madeThe only reason people are giving  star is that they dont like ratio  they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down I really hate them  Sorry for my bad English language I live in EUrope my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge,Positive
Jurassic World Dominion offered a different but enjoyable twist to the usual direction taken in the franchise The impossible notion that dinosuars are something that can be introduced to everyday life is what makes the film truly unique Aswell as this it removes the thrill of seeing the dinosaurs because weve become accustomed to them after multiple movies It is difficult to keep the enthusiasm everyone held for the first film once you repeat the same formula again and again As far as Im concerned they just about pulled it off The only reason I managed to find a little enjoyment out of the movie was because I was surrounded by friends who were genuine cowards Personally I wouldnt watch again but Im glad I did with the people I did,Notr
Ive watched this movie because it has a great rating and because I love Christopher Nolan and in my opinion it totally deserves this great ratingit could maybe even be a little bit betterThere are tones of great stuff in this movie like the concept of dreaming which the whole movie is about and this is one of the greatest concepts Ive ever witnessed It just makes soo much fun watching these Characters do their thingOn top of that the movie has such a great soundtrack Hans Zimmer has once again topped himself The actors also do their best to make the emotional scenes hit hard and theyve done their Job really really wellThis movie is one of the greatest of all time in my opinion and you should probably watch it if havent already,Positive
One morbilion stars i will watch it on morbilion times grapei recomd everyone watching it morbius was veryily handsome as bat infected villani wonder somethimes how this will effect the socioeconim climate as one morbillion ticket has beens Sold,Notr
If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film then it is excellent  because it truly gets you involved in its main character It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and wellacted buddystory at its core It delicatelyand sometimes brutallyjuxtaposes Andy Dufresnes Tim Robbins goodnatured character with the harshness of prison life projecting so much heart in doing soHowever delightful as it is The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches  its only a very safe buddystory A damn good one but still just that So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied because what will it be remembered for Friendship Huh neat I therefore dont think its entirely deserving of being considered the  greatest film of all time on IMDbcomBut moving on and looking past that it is possibly one of my alltime favourite films for the feelings it leaves Sure it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story On top of that it never falls prey to predictable sappiness  probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship It is so wellsewn together by a feelgood narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film,Positive
You know whats going to happen almost from the off But dont let this detract from the fact that this film is hugely enjoyable And brings the gang together,Notr
First of all CN is without doubt the best director of our time because he is unmatched by any director in his styleatmosphere  tone and ending  he directs because that what he want  he dont want some Blockbuster that everybody will forget after they leave the cinema  he wants to put his signature and to be remembered for his artInception is a movie that only smart people will know what is going on  from the beginning to the end the whole movie for some reason felt like one big scene maybe because there was no holes in the plot perfect logic and mastermind director  min was like dream  really Nolan manged to make a movie that will make you live in dreamlike feeling for me at least  the acting  soundtrack  locations  atmosphere and the special effects are all PERFECT A masterpiece work of art  this is what you got when the writer direct the movie  and for those who feel a little bit lost it is like The Matrix but in the eyes of Christopher Nolanif something happened to CNolan say goodbye Hollywood ,Positive

Im so angry at this movie and Lana Watchowski for making it There are so meany things wrong with this money it feels cheap like almost meaning less and just pure pop The first movie has purpose a clear purpose to save humanity the last remaining city etc But here theres no urgency theres no higher purpose just a love a story that doesnt seem to need to exist the whole arc feels purposeless The supporting characters feel so fake so out of place the dialogue is full of slang pop culture language that doesnt make sense it almost feels like a teenager wrote this Neo feels truly stupid and clumsy instead of powerful and purposeful I could really go on worst matrix movie every such a missed opportunity,Notr
So bad I cant even find words to describe it Why Funny Nope Exciting Nope Did we learn something Yeah never ever watch The Emoji Movie again And Hollywood has too much money And NEVER EVER watch this crap again,Negative
It is a cinematic masterpiece that delves into the profound human experiences hidden within the darkness of a prison Tim Robbins portrayal of Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freemans captivating performance as Red create an indelible bond that transcends the boundaries of their confined world Director Frank Darabont weaves a poignant tale of hope friendship and the pursuit of redemption against the backdrop of injustice and despair The films visual splendor and evocative soundtrack enhance the emotional depth of the story leaving audiences inspired and deeply moved Finding Beauty in the Shadows The Shawshank Redemption reminds us that even in the bleakest of circumstances the human spirit can find solace and beauty making it an enduring and cherished classic,Positive
I got forced to watch this one I never wanted to there was a small child relation who wanted to see a movie and this was the only one on in theaters when we were out And by gum was it badSo so badBad enough it took me nearly three months just to work up the courage to write a quick review The charactersactors it was downright depressing hearing Sir Patrick Stewart one of the finest actors alive voicing a character named Poop Ugh But generally the characters were awful The female lead I wanted to fling her out a window Shes loathsome The comedic sidekick was only made worse by James Cordens poor performance And Eugene the main lead was just irritating and unappealing The comedy is dreadful The plot frightful The little girl I went with fidgeted the whole time not once did she laugh or smile She seemed bored So dont try and claim kids will like it Kids are too good for this This is an ad A poorly done ad Avoid it you cant even MSTK this thing Abandon all hope ye who view,Negative
I am amazed that music talents like Taylor and Jennifer would sink this low in their carears as to join in with a complete tonedeaf cast of misc actors just to be in a musical on screenDoint the same roles at Broadway would have been much more logical and carear smart imhoBut if you like to watch a vulgar Rebel spread her legs wide and lick her tail you will get your fetishes all fullfilledIt is more painfull to watch the CGI effects in this movie than even rewatch old episodes of Star Trek from the s or sIt is a compliment to give this film a  star ranking but  is not possible to give,Negative
This movie had so much talent but was a huge letdown to me as a somewhat expected it to be better with Maya Rudolph Its okay for little kids but anyone over  most likely would be bored Overall this movie couldve been better and it really sucked,Negative
Highly enjoyable glad I didnt listen to the critics This may be the Marvel character movie nobody asked for but maybe its the movie we didnt know we needed,Notr
Sonys film studio has manufactured another hit And thats all you will want after seeing this film To be hit as many times as possible with a rusty crowbar The cheapest sloppiest animation goes nicely with this unfunny unoriginal mess Dont spend your hard earned money and watch it to see how bad it is Pirate it if you really want to see how bad it is,Negative
I really liked this movie it is long but keeps you intrigued and interested What I didnt like and made me want to stop watching it is the score there is way too much of it too overwhelming that the characters dont have any personality all emotions are driven by the score and the orchestral backdrop really This is present in most Hollywood movies which is unfortunate,Positive
This movie is really bad so please save your money and time and not dont watch this bad movie I honestly dont know how kids like This movie doesnt even diserve  star it should get ,Negative
Its not the best animated film thats true but its far from the worst I took my young daughter to see this and we were both entertained I noticed a lot of people complaining about this being a string of advertisements but most movies are filled with product placements its usually just more subliminal Emoji movie is about the imaginary world inside your phone so they used several widelyused apps throughout the movie to transport us through this phone world Its not entirely unclever It was kind of enjoyable to see some of these familiar apps from a different perspective Dont set your expectations too high its not a Pixar but the animation is good and the story watchable,Negative
My mind is aching I have just seen the movie and I really liked it I went to cinema with  other people and all of them were satisfied After Avatar I was very disappointed about cinema But Inception showed that brilliant ideas still exist and it shows that how can you apply visual effects to tell a story not just to show off It has something new to offer Im not a fan of science fiction movies specially ones with strange creatures What makes me to like Inception this much is the fact that it picks one real thing something we encounter every day our dreams and takes us to the unknown world of dreaming I loved Matrix at its time and Im loving Inception It feels more real than every other SciFiction movie I have ever seen Worth watching absolutely recommendable,Positive

Inception is one of the most fascinating and mindblowing movies I have ever watched The storyline is unique and deeply thoughtprovoking taking the audience into a world where dreams and reality blend together in the most creative way Christopher Nolan has done a phenomenal job in crafting such a complex yet engaging narrative that keeps you thinking even after the movie endsLeonardo DiCaprios performance as Dom Cobb is simply brilliant He portrays his character with so much emotional depth and intensity that you truly connect with his journey The supporting cast including Joseph GordonLevitt Tom Hardy Ellen Page and Marion Cotillard also deliver excellent performances that perfectly complement the storyThe concept of dreams within dreams is incredibly wellexecuted The visuals are stunning the cinematography is topnotch and Hans Zimmers background score elevates the entire experience to another levelespecially the track Time which gives goosebumps every timeInception is not just a movie its an experience It challenges your perception and keeps you engaged from start to finish For me Inception is the best movie ever made and I would gladly recommend it to anyone who loves intelligent storytelling suspense and scifi thrillers,Positive

So go see Morbius if you want a fun movie with some flaws and dont believe all the reviews and check it out for yourself",Notr
Morbius has brief moments of quality and good ideas but they are ultimately not enough to elevate a weak origin story for its title character that feels rushed with plenty of pointless elements lazy writing and a pair of laughably bad end credits scenes so embarrassing they bring the whole film down a couple of pointsJared Leto gives a reasonably charismatic lead performance with a few good jokes but can only do so much with a bland character and overall lack of emotional heft Matt Smith on the other hand is easily the sole standout element completely over the top and clearly enjoying it with a dance Bully Maguire would be proud ofThe CG is extremely messy and distracting especially in the final fight which is almost completely incomprehensible The action overall is competently shot but lacks any real weight or impact Its made worse by a lack of blood and an over reliance on slow motion that makes the whole thing feel a decade old on arrival,Notr

It is year  and yet this movie is still the best movie I have ever seen It truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all times Story telling acting directing anything that you can imagine about a movie is so perfectly done I believe everyone will have his own message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells how important the role of hope in our life is you are at the correct address The atmosphere in the prison the way people feel and the way all these things were put together in a two hours movie there is nothing to say It is just exceptionally plain good A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart,Positive
My first watch through I was not impressed with the depths of the philosophy with very basic and obvious questions on what is real On a second viewing the key scene where Sheperd tells Neo Everything was simpler back then People wanted to be free Its different now Sometimes it feels like people gave up Like the Matrix won The Matrix won because weve all become so addicted to the noise constantly being pumped at us or as Merv puts it FaceZuckerSuck The Analyst plays on our desires and fears Quietly yearning for what you dont have while dreading losing what you do Its a direct commentary on the state of our world today So glad I was able to take in a nd viewing after having some time in between to reflect on it,Notr

At the time of writing this comment IMDb ranks the Shawshank Redemption as No  in top  best movies of all time Let me tell you that this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDbs strict rating criteria Shawshank is indeed up there amongst the best and if you havent seen it yet you should make it a point to watch it at least once sometime in your life For it is an astonishing tale of endurance courage life and perspective combined with a stunning score that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it could make grown men cry No words can explain how good Shawshank really is but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by devotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness,Positive

Full disclosure Im not a fan of the comics or cartoon its seems like a serial in which you need to know all of it to enjoy any of it Much like the one episode of the cartoon I tried to watch with this movie I didnt know if I should take none of it seriously since it feels silly or all of it seriously since the world is at stake The logic is very farfetched and its hard to know when youre supposed to turn your brain off or pay attention to what youre watching so I was lost a few times Overall though I could see this fitting into the movie rotation of a yearold boy However its far too generic derivative and homogenized to be enjoyable to anyone else especially fans of the source material,Negative
The Shawshank Redemption is reasonably well written directed acted and filmed Yet in my judgment it is a belowaverage movie It lacks a real plot and while the title promises redemption nobody and nothing is redeemed The characters lack depth and many events are implausibleNo doubt wardens and prison guards can be wicked people But those portrayed in this film are so completely perverse that they become uninteresting Their function is to represent the establishment and authority The audience is meant to identify with Andy Dufresne the main character While innocent of the murders of which he is convicted hes hardly an admirable character and he becomes worse during his imprisonment Hes a clever manipulator who eagerly cooperates in the wardens criminal activities in the hope of profiting from doing sowhich he eventually does The prison also has has a contingent of homosexual rapists who are called not human so as to avoid admitting that their behavior is all too human and very much in need of redemptionThus the films popularity it appeals to our tendency to rationalize our own wickedness by comparing ourselves with moral monsters Unfortunately serving that function does not make a mediocre film great any more than serving sound moralism does,Positive
Quite frankly I dont see how this got bad reviews Im actually quite shocked In my opinion the bad reviews come from people who never understood the first  I was entertained and engaged the entire time,Notr
The Dark Knight is a trilogy movie that I watch and re watch a lot of times Full of action great cinematography amazing pacing on the editing side and storytelling wise is just flawless I can say that my favorite of the  is the second one with Joker just amazingFor me the best Batman out there,Positive
Every time they play it on the tv I watch it as if its my first time watching it Amazing movie with the best happy end ever Theres a timeless quality to this film that makes each viewing feel fresh and emotionally resonant Its an amazing movie with what I consider the best happy ending ever They truly dont make movies like this todayfilms that are both deeply moving and profoundly upliftingWhat makes The Shawshank Redemption so remarkable is its layered storytelling and the way it explores the resilience of the human spirit The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne a banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two life terms at Shawshank State Prison Despite the harsh realities of prison lifeincluding violence corruption and despairAndy never loses hope His quiet strength and unwavering belief in justice become a beacon not only for himself but also for those around him especially his friend Red played masterfully by Morgan FreemanThe friendship between Andy and Red is the heart of the film Their bond forged over decades is a testament to the power of human connection even in the bleakest circumstances Reds narration provides insight and warmth guiding us through the years at Shawshank and revealing how hope can survive even behind bars The performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are nothing short of extraordinary bringing depth and authenticity to their characters Critics have praised their nobull performances and the genuine chemistry that holds the film together creating something undeniably powerful and moving,Positive
Inception is the Smartest film of the YearINCEPTION PG Directed by Christopher Nolan Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Inception is the smartest film you will see all year It never plays down to the audience in fact it assumes the audience is intelligent Inception tells the story of Dom Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio as a thief with the rare ability to enter peoples dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost him everything he loves Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task Plant an idea in someones mind If he succeeds it will be the perfect crime but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobbs every moveThis movie is challenging but always in a fun and inventive way that keeps you captivated It is an updated s crime drama with a technological twist that just works After the fight scene in the hallway you will agree with me that Christopher Nolan will no doubt take home a few Oscars this year Sound Design Cinematography best Original Screenplay Director and Film unless something monumental is released between now and then One scene alone should get Nolan the Oscar and that being the city folding back on itself Most films this year are like sitting down to a bowl of potato chips Inception is like sitting down to the juiciest thickest most filling steak dinner youve had in years Inception opens Friday July   out of  Stars Jay Fox,Positive

I would like to ask if the people responsible for this movie ever watched one episode of Dragon Ball before doing the movieI would advise to change the name to something else because it has absolutely nothing to do with Dragon ball A disrespect to this great AnimeIt would be better that someone from marvels movies Heroes series etc do itBest regardsPhilipp Gieseking,Negative

It brought the legendary creator of Dragon Ball out of retirement reigniting the beloved franchise and leading to the creation of two new installments Dragon Ball Super and Dragon Ball Daima This unexpected return thrilled fans worldwide as it introduced fresh stories powerful characters and new adventures while staying true to the spirit of the original series The revival not only expanded the Dragon Ball universe but also showcased the enduring popularity and cultural impact of the franchise across generations uniting longtime fans and newcomers alike So thats why its a  out of ,Negative
How can this movie be done so poorly How can the special effects be so bad in  Also why do we have the same old tired lines and dialogue decades later Why does a dinosaur take so long to eat someone Its it has to look above the car under the car into the preys eyes and then pose for a photoshoot It all seemed so stupid I mean at the beginning of the movie Chris Pratt makes a promise to a dinosaur Its insulting to the audience This movie was long and boring and I was actually hoping the dinosaurs get to eat some of these boring tired characters I could not care less about what happens to any of them I still have  min left of the movie but I felt compelled to write this review while still watching it,Notr

Morbius is an interesting choice of a character to add to the MCU or Sony SpiderMan Universe especially to have a standalone movie Unlike Venom which has more recognition in general audienceThis is not a bad movie Mediocre at its best Fun action sequences good atmosphere for its genre and characters but again its very basicThe conflict is very predictable and overused Somehow the runtime is too long for what the storyline trying to tell with that being said weirdly some moments still felt rushedNo actual character development no memorable hero moments The cinematography is done well Jared Letos acting is great I just hope it was written better both the dialogue and storylineBut then again with Morbius has a possible appearance in future Marvel Movie especially in MCU Im still intrigued and excited,Notr

I am a huge Jurassic Park fan and the st movie was and always will be one of my favorite movies that Ive ever seen in theatersAll these new dinosaur species but not enough present on screenWhenever action starts it goes by so quicklyI think Jurassic World movies should be more about dinosaurs not about human characters and their relationshipsLooks like Hollywood is determined to ruin every single s and s cult movie,Notr
This movie was written and directed by one half of the Wachowski sibling duo and it shows A little too selfaware of itself at times with action scenes that look muddled and feel stifled the seemingly wide open expanse of the previous Matrix movies is reduced to obviously apparent soundstages in this one Whether its the budget or the missing Wachowski or something else there are flashes of what couldve been a really good movie but part of the magic is gone Or perhaps I set the bar too high Maybe I overlooked the flaws in the previous movies because I was blinded by the excitement and magic of its newness,Notr
The movie is an extraordinary piece of the filmmaking art in all its aspects the plot is carefully and smartly written as a intricately wrought canvas the character development is very satisfying the movie was shot well and nicely directed the epic score fits the scenes and add up to the whole visual experience the acting was intense by all cast where each fit their role perfectly specially Heath Ledger who managed after all these years of having the Joker around in comic books animations TV series and even movies to literally bring this complicated character with all its twisted brilliant sadistic dark and sometimes funny personality to live on the big screen,Positive
i watched this movie just to pass out some good time and you know what i had sore and wet eyes at the end i dont know why but the movies end couldnt stop myselfandys portrayal by tim robbins and reds by morgan freeman was absolutely greati like and love andys philosophy that hope is a good thing  and i have tried to inculcate that in me i just loved the movie i was like whats this its ended so fast i didnt it want to end i am not a con and neither i wanna be but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths i mean that they also have got something in them their hearts the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great it shows that when you want to do something do it with full heart i have just finished itbut im sure i m gonna watch this very often and am not going to forget it for a long length of time,Positive

 horror it was so bad that i bled from my eyes Everything became blurred but the terrifying smiles of those emojis They haunt me in my dreams Theyre more than just emojis Theyre demons sent from hell to punish us for our sins After watching the movie I went straight to my room and jumped out of the window I am here typing with a broken leg spinal cord and skullThank you very much for this terrible movie from hell,Negative
Yeah this movie is just absolute garbage like seriously a movie about literal things you send in chats this movie is pretty corny and stupid as well the plot is about a cornball simp the movie just sucks and a princess emoji thats being hunted What is even the point of this movie existing the person who made this should be ashamed and  million US dollars to make such a terrible movie is suck a waste like yeah it made a good amount of money like  million us dollars but movie was just bad man I watched this in  and saw how corny it was and i just didnt watch it also this movie sucked I wish I could give zero,Negative
Judging from the trailer I dont expect much what will be in the movie Acting are quite Okay but storyline are really awful This movie cant be compared to Original Dragonball Well at the beginning is quite okay but as the story goes make me want to sleep And even what they did to Bulma Bulma didnt carry any gun If I not mistaken Well to be honest I just may advised for those who still have respect Dragonball I recommended you not to watch this movie as you will get angry after watching this movies Sorry for all the cast but I only be able to give  However for those of didnt like Dragonball you might find this movie is interesting,Negative
I was keen to see this film given the high IMDb rating as I agree with nearly all ratings Ive seen on the site but I appear to be one of the minority who think it is overrated I couldnt emotionally engage with the characters for some reason and so was not too concerned on the outcome for themWhilst there were some complexities to the plot it is reasonably easy to understand I agree with some other comments Ive seen that many characters accepted the quite fantastical premise very readily and were prepared to place themselves at considerable risk for no real reason So some reactions were not what you would expect for the situationHaving had time to reflect I would watch the film again but do not think I will keep coming back to this unlike the Matrix which has a similar feel but is a much better film,Positive
Thought this would be atleast hilariously bad spurred on by the terribly hilarious reviews but I assure you the witty reviews are the only entertainment involved with this film Disjointed dull and just generally horrific I felt like it would never end Particularly scarring somehow even more so as the rest was the sight of Idris Elba as a cat something burnt into my eyes now nightmare worthy,Negative
The Emoji Movie and The Garbage Pail Kids are tied for the worst movie I have ever seenFor those that dont know The Garbage Pail Kids Movie is an s movie based on a card game And boy that movie was horrible The Garbage Pail KIds themselves all look ugly and are poorly designed You should see the Nostaglia Critic review on this and The Emoji Movie because The Garbage Pail Kids just absolutely broke Doug Walker the hostOnto The Emoji Movie First off who came up with this Its cringy and full of stupidity Second the charecters are all brats Jailbreak is always acting so bossy even when shes not the one in trouble High was the worst one of allHe has a very annoying voice terrible humor and just useless in the journey except for just causing more chaos Gene was boring hardly did anything However I must give some credit to the animatio in this movie its amazing But still save your time and moneyScore ,Negative
I cannot even begin to describe the emotional impact this movie gave me Im not sure how to post the right emoji on here D There TJ Kirk brilliant plays the lead emoji character who is assisted by none other than Andrew Lincoln as flick thumb boy The best way to describe this movieSausage Party for kids It does have some mature themes so I would say more like Life of Pets with butt holes,Negative
I read many reviews when movie released Even then I gave a try but I think it was a mistake Movie was written directed and executed badly The characters in the movie were also unrelatable You cant connect either with hero or villian The editing work was also bad Camera work was also weird and confusing In short this movie didnt have any soul It looked like Sony made this movie just for the sake of keeping the rights with them Overall it was a bad attempt to make a movie,Notr
Not only is this film one of the most touching I have ever seen it also has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings I have ever seen  The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best Ive heard,Positive
I feel like people ranked this movie so high just because it was the thing to do The movie was overall just okay if you really look at it and pick it apart,Positive
What is the point of this movie get it out of here,Negative
"The is the best movie of all time IMOIts the type of story where you can get lost in and feel like youre actually there watching it all
Its not a fast moving movie with overchoreographed scenes and copious special effects Instead its a simple story with a deep touch that everyone can relate to in some way Then theres the hidden mystery of the escape thats going on and you know its going on but you never see it hinted at until the moment its revealed This will keep you engagedThe selection of relatively unknown actors aside from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman playing minor but pivotal roles magnificently adds to the genuine feel of the story and the feeling of being there in the momentNo surprise that this is often regarded the greatest movie of all time",Positive
Jurrassic Park was a Pop Culture masterpiece Sequels will not recapture that initial magic However I found Jurassic World Dominion fun and satisfying for the most part It was great to see the union and reunion of past and present characters There were nice character arcs and cool dinosaurs and action scenes Thats all I needed Im not sure why the critics raged it so poorly Most average viewers enjoyed it Just enjoy it for what it is,Notr
I dont understaind SONY dont see what result has with his production Why they dont let MARVEL do the movies They simply destroy Spiderman univers,Notr
Its shot sooo dark its impossible to tell whats going on or what happens The fighting was impossible to see anything The echo location was cool and Matt Smith was the best part of the movie When he was calling out for Michael to come out and play it was absolutely Demonic sounding Find the cheapest way to see this movie and dont waste your time,Notr
The storys quite plain the acting is OK but nothing really over the top even though the soundtrack the quality of the shots and the atmosphere really stood out I think its for obvious sentimental reasons that people like this movie The good guy takes a lot of crap but wins in the end because hes smart There are way better movies than this one and I really cant understand why so many people rate it   equals perfection and very few pieces of art come close to it I think  is a very high rating and this movie probably doesnt deserve more than an  maximum The masses dont necessarily appreciate subtle art and want to be entertained thats what the movie industry is about Still this movie was quite gay Way too much emo and way to predictable,Positive
Ive lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie but it is more than  It has to be one of the best movies ever made It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors beforeI have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movieNot everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movieSomething that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action no special effects and no gimmicks  of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the endFor me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it no matter how many times I have seen itBrilliant brilliant movie and a must see for everyone,Positive
Best movie ever made Period Not for smallbrained people You need to really think hard to fully understand the concepts and details in this movie Layers deep it covers every emotion throughout watching  acting and the casting was flawless Leo portrays a desperate protagonist you never stop rooting for despite his flaws The concept of planting an idea into anothers subconscience that they assume to be their own original idea  mindbending mindaltering mindincepting greatness This is a movie you must pay attention every second of every scene otherwise youll be confused Nolans best work by far took over a decade alone to write Not sure a movie of this depth will ever be matched By the end of the film if your not completely blown away in awe chances are youre lost Though it takes place in a near future where dreams can be infiltrated it remained completely believable throughout Enjoy and remember pay attention ,Positive
When I saw this the CGI was not completed The cats looked like they were floating above the ground like on a cheap green screen there were cats that didnt have hair on them and there were major inconsistencies in the CGI they tried to create a plot because the broadway really doesnt have one just a bunch of cats introducing themselves for  hours but the plot was not very interesting the main antagonist fell completely flat the cats were incredibly creepy why did they have human faces and hands but they were the size of normal cats Everyone thinks this film is hilariously bad but honestly its not even funny bad it felt like torture watching this movie,Negative

The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic masterpiece that perfectly captures the essence of hope friendship and resilience The film follows the journey of Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins a banker wrongly convicted of murder as he navigates the harsh realities of Shawshank prison Morgan Freeman delivers an unforgettable performance as Red the seasoned inmate who befriends Andy and narrates the story with depth and emotionWhat makes this film truly exceptional is its storytelling Frank Darabonts direction combined with Stephen Kings powerful source material results in a film that keeps you engaged from start to finish The pacing is perfect the dialogues are thoughtprovoking and the emotional payoff is immense The cinematography and Thomas Newmans hauntingly beautiful score add to the films timeless appealBeyond being a prison drama The Shawshank Redemption is a story about never giving up no matter the odds The climax is one of the most satisfying in film history leaving the audience inspired and deeply moved Its no surprise that this film remains at the top of IMDbs list of greatest movies ever made,Positive
I was very depressed and sad before watching this I felt there was nothing to live for I even felt like committing suicideBut I watched this film once Then twice Then a third And a fourth Something clicked with me It was an epiphany I felt so much different So I stayed up for two whole days while lying in my bed I fasted to focus on my thoughts Now thanks to this film Ive decided to kill myself,Negative
It indeed sucks  I went to the cinema  days ago knowing it would be like this but ah hell I saw every single episode of the DragonBall series in English and Japanese and I just had to see thisEven though it was horrible it was funny  Especially since I went with my friend and were both great fans of the DragonBall Z Abridged series made by TeamFourStar Youtube it its awesome P And we could made some comments on the movie to pass the timeAnd once again I am happy Im a guy cause the only real things that caught my attention were Bulma and that Piccolo henchman chick  Well all in all its funny but you should only go to the cinema knowing youre gonna pay  euros for a waste of time But with that thought it can be fun  Btw that Goku guy makes a lot of the same expressions as the Chosen One from Kung Pow Kung Pows acting and humor is way better tho P,Negative

Terrible idea terrible executionA movie about emojis Really Sounds like a stupid idea that was mostly made to get with the trendsThe writing is awful and it is just a bad movie,Negative
The Jurassic Park movies used to be about cracking boundaries whether that was by scientifically bringing back dinosaurs or showing us that we can enjoy a movie about monsters eating people whilst still feeling small and real and have that out of worldly feeling Im afraid in this instalment the only new ground being struck is the fact that we see all of these beloved characters interact together for the first time and then appropriately be chased by dinosaurs,Notr

OK so the Movie wasnt great but it wasnt that bad I am a huge Dragon Ball Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT fan I own and have watched every episode I think that you first have to realize that this is a Dragon Ball movie not a Dragonball Z movie Yes its not exactly like the anime but did you really expect it to be First there is no way the live action characters will look exactly like the anime they are real people not cartoons Also as for the fighting have any of you actually watched Dragon Ball it was very comedic in its fighting especially early on in the series Dragon Ball was a long series and they tried to cram it into a single movie There were some missing components in the movie and some changes I think overall it wasnt that bad I know I will buy it when it comes out on DVD Also if they make a sequel I will watch it,Negative
I agree that this film was not good Not because of bad writing animation voice rendered but the timing of the film coming out mattered If this same film was released before Wreck it Ralf The Lego Movie Pixels Inside Out then people might have liked it But now it is like Sony desperately wanted their version of toys andor games related film so they made it Thats how it looks like Despite all the criticism the film minted good sum So it is not a box office flop only devalued honestly by those who saw itThose titles I mentioned and this story has the same storyline Basically thats very common platform where  per cent of the films borrow from The scenes looked very ordinary like theres nothing much to explore The jokes were weaker the characters were uninteresting in most of the parts I would say they did not utilise them rightly The good thing is it is a watchable film but the majority wont like it Usually Sony animations were met with underwhelmingly and seeing the response it had got surely there will be no sequel at least for now,Negative
Heath Ledger is the star of the show but the acting in the move is great on all sides The pacing the sets the music is wonderfully shot and make you sad when the end credits start to roll This is the type of movie that I try to watch at least once a year It also cemented my option of Christopher Nolan as one of the great directors of the current generation It would have been amazing to see where Heath Ledger could have gone in his career based on his iconic performance in this movie Nitpicks Christian Bales voice changes are a little odd and I dont know if they are necessary for the movie to get its point across,Positive
A fair number of the movies that rank high on this sites top  all time list also share a parallel life as literature so lets start thereThe book Rita Hayworth etc is the best of the Different Seasons tetralogy King adhered to the first person perspective which is a challenge the narrator can only know what comes into his range of perception You as the reader have to decide if you trust him and so on King wrote this in the early handtomouth period of his existence  and what do we have A prisoner who persistently writes to his benefactors for more fundingDarabont didnt have the skill necessary to really offer anything of artistic value here Were stuck with borrowings parts of Convict  Gilda Brubaker Birdman of Alcatraz musically the Marriage of Figaro aria  its actually not a bad bit of selfreference Its the only good visual part here and even that is smothered by the narration literarily Dumas Monte CristoThe book does a good job of playing with the readers expectations and using irony Theres no preaching And it ends far more intelligently than this does the denouement here seems to belong in a different movie altogetherThis isnt a bad movie considering the obscene amount of money invested in these things its hard to find a truly bad movie any more  one with no cinematic value at all  that wasnt the case    years ago But theres no way I can love it It just isnt the sort of movie that resonates with me because the story is just there with no life of its own,Positive
First of all you must be a die hard fan of the Trilogy  Castaneda and Eastern philosophy to understand it Im no specialist in CGI effects and fighting scenes but the the first half of the movie is Tarkowski level with clues and referrals to discover themeverywhere and the second half an ode to freedom which is harder to get the older you are as Don Juan said when describing to Castaneda the enemies of the man of knowledge All in all I found it brilliant an deeper than many movies at the Matrix One level Thoroughly enjoyed it,Notr
Like a beautifully crafted French wine this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year Every time I have viewed it over the past decade and it must be at least more than  times by now I have found newer shades subtler indications and deeper meanings And it has amazed me like very few have No overacting  Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank  Method in the madness of running the scams from inside  The complete secrecy maintained for  years not even Red knew  The best that a highlyeducated intellectual could do inside such a prison  What a great actor the Warden turned out to be  totally despicable  What a bunch of speakable quotes what a bunch  Totally recommended for any young person  students especially  HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS  a message that shines through,Positive
Im sorry for anyone who thinks that  is an unfair rating because its only a kids movie but thats not a good enough excuse Saying that is completely unfair as there have been loads of movies for kids that have been well done with funny jokes for kids and adults with a unique art style and a heartwarming plot Kids movies that didnt seem like it wasnt checked enough and movies that had actual effort put into it The emoji movie does not have any effort put into it and even someone who is very young can tell that most of the jokes in the emoji movie are lazy and stupid and the plot is laughable not to mention its basically an advert you have to pay for Its just a movie to attract kids and get a lot of money You might enjoy the emoji movie but I would NOT recommend it The emoji movie makes me sick,Negative

The questionable acting and visuals the pacing the nonsensical plot It feels lame cheap and incomplete The interactions of the characters are mostly robotlike and lack deeper emotions The dialogues are really bad The events and the behavior of people are illogical The fight scenes are garbage Making this PG is a bad joke should have been R The references to MCU movies are forced and cringy Also misrepresented The post credit scene is idioticIt has zero rewatch value Its not even a good popcorn movieI cant recommend it other than a collection of bad examples for future filmmakers to avoid,Notr

Saw it at a preview last night and thus did not have the benefit of reviews beforehand Although I let most of my kids watch Batman Begins I wont let anyone but the teenagers see this one I thought the movie was exceptional but the menace of The Joker is too intense for kids younger than that Im not suggesting theyll be scarred for life but dont let the action figures and kids meals fool you  this movie feels real and its one of the darkest Ive seen in a long time If youve read the Batman graphic novels of the modern era then you know what to expect but people unfamiliar with how low Batman can go may be in for a shock my wife was oneHeath Ledger for Best Actor,Positive
Most of this film is how can we hurt the dinosaurs or have them hurt each other No character has growth no positive development through the story Last movie was kill all the dinosaurs in a volcano eruption and watch them die and this time lets put them all in a sanctuary and then burn it down Why the constant need to kill all the dinos This crew should really be able to do better by this point Very unimpressed,Notr
I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular its quite simply beyond me The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of Kings short story found it very true to the spirit of the book and voted  for that I really could not find anything worth my time in this film and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end one or two good lines of dialog and the acting theres really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for Its about hope and the director wont let us forget it so its repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep Its like this short onenote story was written and the author just didnt want to end it so he kept writing and writing until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling for the love of all that is holy stop writing And I thank that faceless man for doing that because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was  minutes long and not  or dare I say it  The film simply drones on and on scene after scene containing nothing remotely interestingbut with excellent acting mind you Theres nothing good about this film except for the acting Just about all of it is great I cant really think of anything else to say I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of Kings writing I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film I recommend this to fans of Stephen King the actors and possibly Frank Darabont If youre not a fan of any of these people I doubt youd find this enjoyable ,Positive
This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my lifetime if not the worst the story line is all over the place and the character development is just sad if I was this movie i would just end it already There was no chance or hope in the beginning for this movie So save your  and go see a different movie,Negative
I am far from an expert on musicals and my singing and dancing are subpar but I thought Cats was ok Not this movie but the playmusical whatever its called with real people on a stage This abomination gave me nightmares and I am an old dude The story music and acting could have been amazing but no one will ever know because visually the entire film is like a million fingernails scratching slowly down a million chalkboards It was like Gilbert Gottfried singing the most beautiful song ever the song itself is still good you just never know it because it is dressed in the worst visual effects ever And James Corden how is he a thing He isnt funny his voice is the vocal equivalent of the visual effects of this movie I would rather put leaches on my eyeballs than be in the same universe where this doucherocket exists,Negative
"I liked this film That sums it up pretty well This film is good in some aspects very good but the best film of all time I usually dont say this but I think The Shawshank Redemption is overrated I dont want to take away from the performances the story or the score those were really good I guess Opinions differ and thats fine For me personally the fact that I knew that this film was the highest rated film of all time unfortunately hurt my experience I was expecting a lot more which in the end I didnt get
But still a good watch nonetheless",Positive
The plot is like a Japanese anime named Paprika  So what I dont care Who watch anime anyway  Whats really great about this movie is that  its mass appealing  its visually beautiful and its one of only a few blockbusters especially scifi movies that will stay into your mind for a whileIts a smart movie and the plot is not overcomplicatedThe cast did a great acting job I really love Leo Michael Caine and Cilian Murphys performanceMy review doesnt need to be too long Just go see itI think this is going to become an instant classicCant wait for the next Nolan movie,Positive
People tend to forget that this is a kids movie If my son likes it am happy,Negative
Im appalled that slop like this can be played on screens that can even hover over Dexter or breaking bad just disgusting the humor is terrible not even funny to children and dont get me started on the animation the art direction was non existent or it was there but the only advice was souless just in shock anyone can give this a greater grade than  if this movie is lucky just souless slop dont watch this no matter what,Negative
I have heard all the negative reviews but still decided to watch this This was such a mistakeFrom the very beginning I was holding myself from turning it off but eventually I couldnt handle it anymore This is just a pure garbage that tries to look clever and interesting In reality it is horrible in literally every aspect plot casting action sequences some weird Marvellike jokes that seem totally out of place I really cant understand how a movie that came out in  can look so much worse than the original that came out  years beforeDo yourself a favor  dont watch this trash and save some good memories about eradefining original,Notr
Christopher Nolan is a GeniusNothing new in thatBut the new thing is that he had paired with DiCaprio this timeDiCaprio already has gem this year with Shutter Island and now the count increases to twoThe first hour of the movie tells you everything and you wonder what is left in the next hour and here comes the actionWhat was told in the previous hour was shown practicallyThis Movie contains  layers and a surprising and revealing th layerThe concept is brilliant direction top notch and acting sufficientThe music by Hanzzimmer is hauntingI earnestly hope that this movie bags few OscarsLet this movie be honoredOne surely remembers MATRIX during the movieThough the concept is quite differentthe in differentiation between reality and dreaming reminds you of MatrixAnyways this is quite originalhats off NOLANBut definitely if you expect some real mindless action youll be disappointedThis is Brainy thriller which keeps the viewer thinking and guessingSo all you people who just wants a movie for entertainmentStay outThe remaining just enjoy this movie with your heads onFilm Making at its Best I gave it  on  only because I saw it just twiceMy rating might get higher on repeated viewings,Positive
I dont get all the positive reviews for this movie I found it overlong and I could not find a reason to care about any of the characters Technically speaking there was no true heroic character as it was a bunch of technologicallyadvanced criminals and their victims At several points during the movie I was pleading Go home Go home It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling RIP probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have done it in a shorter time I really think the writers and producers could have made a tighter film with better and more interesting characters Christopher Nolan did terrific terrific work with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight but this film is unworthy of its success,Positive
Hey not all Marvel movies have to be about the big names Spidey Iron Man etc They took a character with a not very recognizable name did the best they could The cliches were there but not too over the top The action scenes and CGI while not jawdropping did keep my interestJared Neto is not my favorite actor but he does a decent job as being driven to succeed without coming off as an egomaniac His character could have used a tighter and more detailed back story Not sure where this timeline fits into the MCU universe although the door is left openWould I pay cash to see this in a theater Nope But an acceptable watch at home,Notr
Yes the movie is terrible from every point of view But when you accept that this is more a fan fiction than anything else and its one of the worst movie ever made You start to laugh and have fun at how ridiculous it isHighly recommend it,Negative
So I dont leave many reviews  I just score the movies and leave it at that NormallyOK so its not terrible It just doesnt feelright somehow The ideas and some of the set pieces are cool The acting from Keanu and Carrie is actually pretty cool it just doesnt seem to all gel together Basically its a solid  just for the ideas and some of the set piecess But at the crux of it all it doesnt feelrightJust my thoughts,Notr
Pathetic Absolutely pathetic DONT waste your ,Negative
I just want to know who thought this movie was a great idea when they represented it ,Negative
This is a movie which deserves more than review O ly two word enough to explain  Almost PerfectThe job is perfect you can see the sweet of cristopher nolan in the every part of movie There is a huge work behind this masterpiece It has a well originated story and it has been empowered with the top class actingBest batman casting so farIt is the best till the nolan decide to direct better batman movie,Positive
One of my favorite Marvel characters SpiderMans favorite antagonist to me I thought the movie was good not great but just fine and it sets up for future appearances of Morbius I would say the movie was slightly better than Venom I thought Morbius was played very well by Jerod Leto So is it worth watching The short answer is yes,Notr
Incredible movie  Weve seen it  times now and are still learning new things Does anyone think that all of Cobbs team infiltrated HIS dreams and that all of this like Michael Douglas in the Game is only for Cobbs sake that the Ken W is only a player in the dream and that his desire to take over the power company was planted the same way they were planting things in Killian Murphys dream  and that even the Killian Murphy subplot was also a plant in Cobbs head Cant wait till this comes out on DVD so that we can study it further Thought the snow mountain scene went on too long but was still way cool The spinning top in the end toppling reveals its not a dream  at least thats how we interpreted it But whens the last time you saw a movie you then discussed for days afterward,Positive
Fun movie dinos eating people little story in there action sequence were great but story felt plausible and rushed Great to see the old school introduce to new school and a few surprises thrown in not what I thought it was gonna be but not as bad as lost world just get some popcorn shut off ur mind and have fun,Notr
So I know Im not supposed to dislike a movie like this especially since Heath Ledger acts so well but Ive seen this film several times Ive given it its due but honestly its not good The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics The phone call scene  are u fing kidding me Its so outlandish that its annoying And the ferries  Common I know its a fantasy but the whole social experiment  is so stupid Arggg I hate this film Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance I know everyone loved this film but honestly its badreally bad Hard pass,Positive
I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the th grade And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was the camera work the acting the story it all took me by surprise It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage So Christopher Nolan thank you for not wasting our time instead earning our time with this film To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general To anyone who doesnt dont waste your time write bad reviews about this film,Positive
Its the best superhero movie to date Amazing casting the cast played their parts with emotion Great framing lighting suspense and just everything about this movie is amazing,Positive
Just Watch it yesterday and it was quite fun movie I love visual effect CGI Dinosaurs they make it super gorgeous but some of the Dinosaurs looks like a robot kinda remind me of Star Wars monster I love the cinematography looks super great and make the visual of the movie more beautiful the story umm at the beginning of the movie the plot story was kinda weird but going to ending the story was getting better and better some of the acting was like overacting Idk it just look like not natural and the pace to sometimes fine sometimes no But ya this movie is still fun to watch,Notr
There are much better films than this with a similar concept or just better writing Its not that anything necessarily went wrong here the concept is OK the story is OK the script is OK the acting might be even better than OK I guess that leaves the production and direction And of course a majority of its reviewers disagree with me so whatever This just isnt a great movie It certainly isnt worthy of its rating and status here and a lot of other places I think maybe it was over produced and designed If it had been simplified into something more Donnie Darko and less Matrix at least it would have been worthy of its better than average performances,Positive
Its just bad horrible terrible please avert your eyes from this movie,Negative
This is a fun action movie with dinosaurs however the politics of the films creators do not need to show up in every other scene of the movie Other than that its great,Notr
Another prime example of Hollywood recycling the same script over again and marketing it as a sequelImpossible to post spoilers everyone knows this storywe saw it twice beforeSame misguided greedy scientist same safe remote sanctuary same black market same heros in car in sanctuary with TRex scratching the paint Toss in a female lesbian likes redheads too black with a few rainbow patches and you got yourself a new movieEven the little bit of new scenarios added were poorly written with inconsistent timelines your mother had a genetic disorder she found out AFTER you were bornNext lines do I have this disorder No your mom altered this out of your genes so you would not suffer the same fate Wait what You just said her mom didnt know about her genetic disorder until AFTER she was born Guess mom invented a time machine as well How does blatant mistakes like this make it past editingI tell me friends to skip this one you already saw it,Notr
This movie has  stars because some rewievers find it funny to give this wreck  stars it dont even deserve that much i knew it would be horrible its a movie about emojis nothing good can come out from such a bad idea but it was actually worse than i expected usually i can laugh about atleast something or find some jokes clever this movie had none of those moments and the vague hints of a femenist message really didnt help whos brilliant idea was it that the female character should say You know women are always coming up with stuff that men are taking credit for when she didnt even say it sure it was implied that was her idea but its so stupid to make it about men taking womens ideas and it was even more obvious what the movie wanted you to think when yet again the female character says later in the movie im not going to be a princess waiting for my prince charming overall a horrible movie with alot stolen from other movies and whats originat is unfunny and bad dont watch it,Negative
Awesome movie Action is fantastic Ending is one of the best Always entertaining,Positive
Actually first of all I cant compare Batman Begins with the Dark Knight They have different plot Begins shows the introduction of Batman the origin of Batman The Dark Knight has a more darker plus interesting plot It is commendable Plus bigger action pieces the movie goes in deep with humans feelings It is quite good and I understand it receives a lot of positive reviews Christopher Nolan did a good job in everything in the movie making the story deep and dark but engrossingThe story The Joker is trying to destroy Gotham and wants to kill Batman at first With his trick plans nobody even Batman can find him or predict his next move Batman must stop the Joker from further destruction of Gotham From there humans emotions slowly rise There are some big action pieces plot that you want to know and electronic music I am somewhat disappointed with Twoface aka Harvey Dent considered the white knight I wished that Twoface will be given a bigger role Other from that it is hard to see any faults with the movie Acting is good Heath ledger makes a good jokerOverall It is good to watch this in cinema The runtime although long seems to pass quickly You wont be disappointed The first scene features bank robbing to hype the audience It not only shows you that it has the big action shows the bad and good of a human which is one of the thing in the movie,Positive
This is the best movie ever I have watched a lot of movies and this one is the best of them all The end irks great and it is just so damn good watch the damn movie,Positive
You would think that Jurassic World Dominion learn the lessons from Disney Star Wars Just because you bring back the original Jurassic Park characters they thought they can bring back and it would be successful but not Poor Laura Dern history repeats itself again,Notr
Dark yes complex ambitious Christopher Nolan and his cowriter Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation I dont usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence The Dark Knight is certainly loud and violent but its not mindless It has depth and soul Even the Joker in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger is deeply human The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself in screen time is not really the lead My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret I believe is his obvious respect for his audience What hes done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions Bravo,Positive
Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover Set in the s the film shows how Andy with the help of his friend Red the prison entrepreneur turns out to be a most unconventional prisonerTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great in one of the best movies ever made,Positive
Like all Nolans films its mindbending and original and incredibly entertaining But sorry theyre not as brilliant as people think Theres always so many holes in the writing as mentioned by others like how Matthew McConaughey went inside a black hole to communicate with his daughter on Earth in Interstellar Is it creative Sure But for those of us who like our writing to be tidy its more than a little annoying Furthermore it has no real twists or intrigueFor a person who is deeply interested and well read in psychology I enjoyed the journey into the psyche through dreams Its accurate in many ways that a dreamer does not control their subconscious and theoretically one could hijack it In fact people do this all the time but one does not need to be asleep and dreaming Its called brainwashing No dream within dreams within dreams necessaryI liked the levels of action  it is a fun watch And all the actors are adept in their roles I really dont even mind when writing is not based in reality as long as people realize that its not Theres really nothing particularly bad about Inception  it just doesnt live up to the hype,Positive
I am not a huge Batman fan But I finally watched this like  years later  I was hoping for Darker but for a Batman movie it was action packed It was like Point Break in Gotham but was entertaining Ledger was good but not the hype performance everyone freaked about Good Joker but he didnt scare me I want joker to creep me TF out and fear his wrath OH well Good movie totally worth watching I think Bale is a good Batman but I really like Keaton I wonder what a new Tim Burton remake would look like with all of the CGI available now that was not around when he made the first Batman with Keaton I say we petition that Get Burton on another really dark one But please please please No Ben AfleckHappy Watching,Positive
"A much cooler indie vibe film compared to Wakanda Forever including Thor Love and Thunder I also enjoyed the almost european tone of the movie The visual effects especially on Michael Morbius transformation were just perfectly refreshing compared to the recent MCU movies which are too over the top with too
Much green screen written all over it Sure you would think its too Batman but only because of the bat scenes Otherwise it can hold on its own I only wish it was a longer film with more action scenes to go with it I truly hope Morbius  is going to happen soon I will be the first in line",Notr
This is a rip off attempt at the original which was a classic This is an insult to the original movie This is a low budget poorly written and poorly executed attempt at making a movieThis movie stunk so bad it lost me within the first five minutes At ten minutes I left the room It was made for people with no IQ no maturity no sense of quality and no humorAll the characters in the movie are annoyingly terrible people The kids the adults and the extras too They all stinkThe movie attempts with too much effort to try and be funny Everything feels like it is forced and the responses from the actors reading their lines is like watching cardboard cutouts disintegrate in the rain,Notr
Have watched the thing twice and frankly I still dont have a clue what the fuss is all about Theres hardly anything special about the movie let alone breathtaking intriguing or groundbreaking The beginning is somewhat promising but pretty soon it all gets painfully predictable right down to the moment the credits start rolling The narrative is way too often overdrawn and phoney the music  heavily pretentious and irritating The performances are not bad but lets face it  the script is far from demanding The storytelling is overwhelmingly fairytaleish and even the drastic bits seem oddly out of the place as if thrown in to make the thing feel more dramatic Words keep flowing in abundance soothingly creating the impression of a nap story told by a lit fireplace Having recently watched the ingenious The Straight Story I was astonished to see how much damage may be done to a picture by putting in too much talkAll that is not to say the movie is appaling However an inch above average is as good as it gets Both Midnight Express and Escape From Alcatraz beat the weepy Shawshank experience hands down ,Positive
James Corden seems to have been stuck in the film to appeal to his American following he certainly wasnt chosen based on his acting or singing skills A truly awful film with no one getting pass marks but Corden was particularly dire,Negative
Boring of me to say but this is one of my favourite movies of all time Stellar performances great plot and an ending that keeps you guessing The CGI is exceptional and I think its arguably one of Nolans best films,Positive
I dont think theres much I can say about this movie that hasnt already been saidEverything from plot points to character motives to Morbius powers are so unexplained I was lost literally  minutes in and it only got worse with every sceneIts so thrown together it doesnt even feel like a real movieThe film leaves you scratching your head for its entire run time and then just ends in the most abrupt way Ive ever seen Its like the final act of the film was never filmedAnd with that everything that looked cool about the movie was cut Vulture narrated the trailer and hes basically not in the film Jokes are left literally incompleteNo part of this movie is memorable other than what has already been memed to deathPlus the end credits scenes are so insanely illogical and near canon breakingAs someone who was actually excited for this movie I am not just incredibly disappointed but Ive lost all hope in the Venomverse,Notr
I will always remember the night I watched this movie for the first time I was yearsold and my dad and I were pretty bored late on a school night So naturally I say to my father Dad I think its time to watch Shawshank I almost regret watching it It is that good Its like nothing I ever see in my lifetime can ever compare to the emotional roller coaster that The Shawshank Redemption takes you onFirst question I usually ask people when discussing films is So have you seen Shawshank No matter what their reply is I am happy with the outcome because if they say no then they are yet to see the greatest movie of all time If they say yes I have something to talk to them about for the next  minutesYou probably still wont believe me when I tell you that this is the greatest film you will ever see Its that good that I actually told one of my friends not to watch it until she was on her deathbed Then she will see this movie without ever having to compare anything else to it Now when I see a movie all I think is Ive already seen the bestNow actually getting onto maybe even reviewing this masterpiece not that any summary of the plot could ever do it justice So all I will say is this I have never heard anyone give this movie a bad review Do yourself a favour and dont even bother to finish reading this Just go and watch it,Positive
Lame female dogs at IMDb wont let me use profanities but the only reason this movie gets such a high rating is because of people who do not know and love the Dragon Ball saga like we do Had to vote  because there is no lower number than that Personally Id vote it a minus  Everything is wrong that can be wrong From how the impersonations look to how they react and meet It should never have come to film This movie is a profanity in and of itself Like to get angry Watch it Otherwise dont Need ten lines minimum so lets review some more Gokus blond and basically human for starters And hes going to school Hes never been to any school until he tries for his drivers license decades after his grandfather dies He grew up in the wilderness with only his grandfather Gohan to guide him There isnt a shred of truth to this movie and theyll probably bar me from posting this but I needed to vent some of my anger at least,Negative
"Not even a large can of tuna topped with catnip could fix this atrocity
A few safety tips before going into the theater to see this
 Plant your entire face into a bowl of bleach keep your eyes open its worth it trust me
 Buy a box of cotton swabs soak them in gasoline and then shove as many as possible into each ear until you cant fit anymore then use a lighter a match will do and light both ends
 If you survived all of this and your still seated at the movie repeat steps  and  as needed",Negative
This is just Wreck it Ralph in emoji form It is basically Inside Out in a meme trash stack of Emojis Put those in a blender and you get this trash It is extremely clich if you say something is going to happen chances are it will happen That is how predictable this movie is Its just a cash grab Its not those so bad it good movies Just DONT WATCH THIS,Negative

Lets understand most people going to this movie grew up watching Dragon Ball ZXTABCXP or whatever Most followed Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z and loved the characters from Goku to Yamcha Krillen was missingI thought the movie followed the story line as best as nonanimated characters can It is a movie people I loved all the characters the plot Although known and the settings OK the Dragon could have been better and Piccolo was mucked Does look like a Buffy vampire and a few more let me say Directors vision issues But I loved the movieAnyone who followed the animation should like the movie NOTE The marketing team is doing a horrible job promoting the movie on television Say what it is not the garbage I saw on TV The bad promotion made me take time out of my day to see the movie before I start reading the bad reviews from people who obviously did not see the movie,Negative
Firstly yes I am a fan of the MCU franchise but this is quite separate from that down to the teams that created this film That being said Morbius is a decent movie understand the harsh criticisms are because people associate this with the MCU thus the bar is set so highOtherwise if you liked the likes of Venom I dont see how you cant fail to enjoy this Yes theres some incoherence and the fact that a vampire movie can have such little if not any bloodbut looking beyond that and seeing this for what it isthe birth of the flawed antihero that is Morbius,Notr
The greatest film in the history of world cinema Theres nothing beyond it periodI honestly cant remember how many times Ive watched it I have no idea how many more times I willEvery single time its the same emotion the same feastYou watch a film and your life changes This is that kind of filmThe most special moments of my life happened while watching this movieI grabbed everyone who hadnt seen it by the collar and made them watch itIts ten times more effective than any kind of medicine meant to lift my spiritsThis film is also a teacherIt taught me so much about the concepts of hope and happinessIm glad you exist The Shawshank Redemption,Positive
The movie showed how a real villain can cause this much chaos to the city And how he really pushed Batman to his edge yet not all of them are strong like Batam as some crossed the line The best movie that shows the two iconic figures Batman and Joker rival together,Positive
I love and I mean LOVE Jurassic Park and I knew this film wouldnt be great so I went in with low expectations but wow this movie is a mess it doesnt feel like Jurassic Park The actors seem like they were paid to try and downplay their acting to give the movie a special sense of corn I was  minutes in before I knew this movie was a fail The best part of this movie is I now know who produced it so I can stay clear of any garbage he tries to come up with next There is no adventure no excitement and nothing exciting about this movie My favorite part is going to be when this garbage heap ends so I can watch anything else other than this,Notr
Its pretty much the exact same thing that happened last time Leto did a comic book movie Im sure its another thing his rich parents paid for him to get into Didnt fit the role storyline fail wasnt entertaining all of it all over again,Notr
Ive had it with these pointless soft reboots Its like Terminator Genisys crossed with A Good Day to Die Hard in terms of sequel style except way way worse It thoroughly destroys the entire Matrix legacy so efficiently in fact that it seems like a parody that is trying to do exactly that It has no soul no point no logic nothing I even hated every single action sequence It was so repulsive I had to look at memes on half a screen to lessen the pain enough to finish the film Turns out there wasnt a single enjoyable second there to find yet I still feel brave for having watched it all the way making it the single worst movie Ive ever finished Easily the greatest disappointment in film history Therefore this movie is an inspiration for fan made Matrix short films and reloadedrevolutions edits Only watch this film if youre being paid good money to do so,Notr
How is this only rated a  This is a good film good plot great special effects Jared Leto playing a good role for once that isnt the Joker because he did a cp job at that and Matt Smith who is great at everything This film has an interesting bad guy no spoilers a compelling story and a hugely famous cast not sure why everyone is giving it a bad rep but as far as Marvel is concerned especially Thor Love and Thunder This is a solid film Plus if you like horror this touches on that and then gets into more of an action film All in all its a good film and Id happily watch it again,Notr
One of the finest films made in recent years Its a poignant story about hope Hope gets me Thats what makes a film like this more than a movie It tells a lesson about life Those are the films people talk about  or even  years from you Its also a story for freedom Freedom from isolation from rule from bigotry and hate Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances Each learns from the other Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as BrooksHe shines when it is his time to go back into the world only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink Stephen Kings story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement It is an extraordinary motion that people will be talking about in  or  years,Positive
The highlight of this film is one man and one man onlythe Late Heath Ledgerhis Oscarworthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetimeand not only him but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film the camerawork was excellent the pace was gripping the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree All in all a perfect film and magnificent actingthe film should have been named after the jokerBatman himself was not neededsuch a Batman film will never again be produced due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger ratingwell done,Positive
"VERY GOOD THIS FILM IS AWESOME
RECOMMEND THE USER VIEW THIS FILM",Positive
This movie has to be one of the very best films ive seen in my lifetime I am usually not that fond of drama films but the portrayal of the characters and the amazing script made it a perfect translation from the Stephen King book Morgan Freeman gives one of his best performances in this movie and actually makes you believe him as a jail smuggler better than Chris Rock in the Longest Yard ever did The cinematography is brilliant showing the sheer scale of this old decaying prison The movie may not have received any Academy Awards the show was stolen by Forrest Gump that year but it still remains to be one of the best films around If your looking for a deeper movie more than youre typical action flick this will provide what you were looking for Go out and rent it heck go and buy it because youll want to watch it time and time again,Positive
You would hope that after  years a sequel would be a big eyepopping production Sadly thats not Resurrection If anything it came across as a lower budget version of the original Matrix if it was a series pilot on the SyFy network It also clearly shows that the first movie was the best and each subsequent installment was a shallower and more convoluted version of the original,Notr
Whose idea was it to make and produce this complete and utter steaming pile of sh Oh wait that was one of the dreadful jokes in this horrific excuse for a movie I wouldnt see this movie if someone paid me a million dollars to let alone  Everyone involved in this product should be ashamed of themselves they are a disgrace to the filmmaking industry and should hand in their resignation,Negative
This must be one of the most stupidly misconceived big budget films Ive ever seen A storyline that actively resists your interest even though you know that there will be dinosaurs Direction so incapable it feels like it was mixed live like some kind of dinosaur concert No doubt there were countless talented creatives involved in this megaproduction its just unfortunate none of them were at the very top,Notr

The script of the movie is very nicely aligned with the scenes of the movie the dialogue delivery of the cast also the cast selection is extremely on the spot shout out the whole team I can say one of the best movies watches ever Act of sir morgan is very lively and natural The whole story of how a innocent banker gets so much to suffer,Positive
Result of Poor writing  Only thing that satisfied me was action sequence before the interval  it really gave a seat edge experience  other than that whole movie was underwhelming  Script was too weak and lame  Except few places  film majorly missed the engaging factor  First half was slow and second half was predictable and boring  hrs mins was too long  literally tested my patience  Cast done their job  Technically visuals were good  Editing was inferior  Overall  unexpectedly a disastrous end to Jurassic saga  Watch at your own risk ,Notr

The most entertaining part of this entire movie was reading these hilariously bad reviews It was SO boring and hard to watch,Negative
The movie is Dull Nothing happens when it happens it is dumb and makes no sense The plot is full of convenience where people are in some place just for happening For example the Morbius boat is full of armed guards just to have some action scene thereAction scenes are short and full of blurred colored effects or dark effects and none of them workUninteresting characters You have Morbius a new made vampire that needs to drink human blood to live You could explore this in so many ways like trying to drink blood from animals buying blood from blood bank and making needing people dying because lack of blood packs leading to I will drink blood from bad people But they decided that trowing a blurred colored ball is more interesting Side characters are empty as wellThis movie is so boring that is more enjoyable to do the dishes,Notr
This is without a doubt my favorite movie Every time I see this movie I feel touched by its magic Most of my friends have seen it because I have recommended them to do it and they have all loved itRobbins Freeman and Whitmores characters are the ones that I like the mostIt is just stupid unfair and shameful that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at The Oscars nor The Golden Globes The IMBD voters have it at  My hope is to see it in the future at ,Positive
I dont usually write reviews but this movie was so bad I felt I needed too I was extremely excited for this movie and I should have just walked out I kept holding on that it might get better it never did This is on the worst movies I have seen in recent memory This movie had absolutely nothing to do with dinosaurs they were just kind of there while this script chased two different story lines trying desperately to merge them together at the end Neither of which had anything to do with dinosaurs or coexisting together That came at the last mins Terrible way to end an otherwise outstanding franchise Dont waste your money,Notr
I dont understand what Ben Ramsey tried to pull with this amateur student film Why would you try and change the storyline when you just had to do pick the main ideas from those hundreds and hundreds of episodes from the series In this movie besides the characters name and the perfect wish granting dragonballs i didnt see any other resemblance to the series plus there are a lot of contradictions with the main story like the end of the movie Goku couldnt transform since hes tail was cut off or the part that Goku used to save the world numerous times and never went to college and all that crap with him being the most powerful person on earth i didnt expect to see him showing off at a party in this lame excuse of a movie Since this is one of your biggest screw ups th Century Fox please read the script next time you want to do an TVseries based movie Just awful,Negative
I have grown up watching Bollywood movies full of overacting by overpaid overfed heroes It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freemans brilliant narration offering a secondperson view of life in shawshank But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced wealthy bankerThe last forty minutes of this film however help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces You dont need a weapon to fight It is easy to take away a mans bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hope,Positive
Lets startoff by saying I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS NO ZERO RATING This must be the worst movie ever The fact that they are grabbing bits and pieces from all the old DB moviesseries is a joke this movie doesnt even make sense I mean the best thing in this movie was probably the yellow dodge charger cant think of anything else O well thanks DB you knocked starship troopers  of my no baddest movie ever list I have been waiting so long for this movie that any mention of it I though yea another release date in a year or so but when It finally arrived I nearly cried and then after the movie I wanted to chew my ow wrist off But yea thanks I hope the  you made from this movie makes you happy Cant someone with a Matrix budget remake this movie please,Negative
Alright so the action was Amazing also the CGI was insaneThe customs Are very goodthe events were kinda slow and very fast in a weird waymusic flashbacks were Extremely Goodi wish they bring all the old cast likeThe real Agent smith and MorpheusBtw watch this movie in home dont waste your moneyJust dont expect a lot from this movie think of it as an Extra Matrix MovieOverallGreat Action Bad Storyi like itEnjoy everybody ,Notr

This review is based on the Spanish version and not the originalA film about the life of emojis may sound too absurdbut somehow the creators of this movie made it work The Emoji movie is surprisingly fun and enjoyable for adults as well Now this is nowhere near being as good as a Pixar animation or something made by Disney but I can honestly say this has a unique quality to it Im sure this will never be a classic or stand the test of time and that is ok See it for what it is and have fun,Negative
I dont know where to start with this except that  The Emoji Movie by Sony pictures is probably one of the most beautiful inspirational movies of its time The animation is so fantastic so clean and so fluid it surpasses any Pixar movie The plot and story is written marvelously the express and work gone into this movie is amazing There is so much emotion that it brought tears to my eyes I have never in my life watched a movie so perfect There is no other movie that can challenge it,Negative
He that lives upon hope will die fasting  Benjamin Franklin Frankly I really dont get the praise for this film It wouldnt even be in my Top  The only thing my spouse has been able to glean from researching the topic on the internet is that psychologically people seem to like the film more and more upon repeated viewings Well that and Morgan Freemans calming voice Not that challenging cinematically and a bit of a fantasy that pawns itself off as gritty realism to be honest Not to be an alarmist but part of me wonders whether this film would be Exhibit A should the country ever descend into a fascist dictatorship much like From Caligari to Hitler by Siegfried Kracauer examined German film during the rise of the Nazis after World War I There is something going on on a group psychology level here that bears examination,Positive
"Id give it an

Along with Q and Pulp Fiction Frank Darabont The Walking Dead original writer and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made its money back in US theaters which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home and it made such a splash that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple  years ago This includes some of Hollywoods best critics including EWs Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B back in late  Yet over time this story of redemption like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end grows on you to the point where at the very end you have no choice but to clap I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I havent looked the same since Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films He made Robbins human made Morgan Freemans voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it wouldve swept away the Oscars Sorry Ralph Fiennes The English Patient won on a weak year,Positive

I wont say I regret watching this wasted effort I will say Im glad to have seen it at home so as not to lament the spent moneyFor the first hour Matrix Resurrections takes us through a build up the seems to have some novelty Then it runs out of steam Rather than taking us to new revelations of the nature of the coexistence of life within The Matrix or even a deeper understanding of the sentient AI it simply devolves into a mindless actioncaper plotEntertaining but definitely not enlightening,Notr
The  movies is destroy the childhood of those fans The main characters like ChiChi or Goku its made like just for training the cgi is one biggest problem before Cats the acting and direction kinda like destroy the experience of Dragonball original The story just made more dull and It Hard to mixture all the scene,Negative
The reviews have not been kind to this movie It is better than expected and overly long and repetitive The plot is good guys get in bad situation with dinosaurs then bad guys get in same situation and get their just rewards Repeat Repeat RepeatThis movie is simply too long It throws in characters from the first three Jurrassic Park films from the s puts them in dangerous situations which they luckily sometimes cleverly escape Luck never runs out for our heroes but the bad guys eventually shoot crapsIt would be much better if twenty to thirty minutes were cut Perhaps if one of the protagonists actually didnt escape every time,Notr
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen  It is truly one of the most fulfilling movies ever made  There are so many good things about it that it is hard to even come close to mentioning all of them so Ill only mention the one thing I liked the most  I liked the fact that the movie could have ended a couple different times and it still would have been one of the best but for Shawshank that just wasnt good enough It kept going until you felt the ending was so perfect that you truly had to sit back breathless  I love this movie and it will always be one of the best as far as I am concerned  A true classic,Positive
The more I think about this unoriginal garbagethe worse it gets The humor is about as entertaining as watching cement drythe characters are  dimensional and annoyingand the plot is from the STONE AGEThe target audience is kids such as myself but I dont see how even the youngest of the young could enjoy this pottygross out humor infested rat nest Not worth anythinglet alone your money Go buy a Pixar film and have actual JOY in watching it,Negative
Too fast cuts bad soundtrack too much gunfire bad villain character No matrix feeling But its entertainment if you dont know the old movies So unfortunately I have to give  stars,Notr
Whilst the IMDb users may disagree the Shawshank Redemption isnt my number  maybe not even my top  But with that said I have seen this movie a few hundred times and it gets wary There is no doubt it is good I may even say its close to great and it has a pretty good watchability rating but its forced metaphors get on my nerves now and in reality is just another prison movie which is above average Boring if you have seen it a few times but for a first impression it is good Once you start to analyze its elements you can begin to see the film for what it is A perfect film it is not but the acting is near perfect and the realism is somewhat accurate Not my favorite film not my favorite prison film but give it a whirl and see how you decide,Positive
Please for your sanity and your bank balance avoidThis steaming pile of garbage was delivered at the th hour and it shows You will never be able to unsee this travesty The effect of pasting a persons face onto a CG fur body ranges from uncomfortable to ridiculous I dont blame the hardworking people at the effects house The director must be held accountableA boring musical theatre experience has been turned into a laughable movieRather have a cat scratch my balls than sit through this codswallop againIf only bleach could remove this monstrosity from my eyes and brainAVOID,Negative

This was a hard watch Im a big fan of this franchise The only entertaining parts are about the last  minutes or so The action is sub par even then Save your money and watch it at home,Notr
To me personally Dragon Ball Evolution was a pretty fine movie despite its flaws if taking it as a standalone movie based on Dragon ball concept characters and elements Due to backlash it received we end up missing out on more DB live action movies for better or worse Some major influencers set the pace  trend of hating it usually under pressure of and to appease loud  proud haters and other people followed just hating it for the sake of hating it like NPC sheeps one after another It wasnt widely hated when it first came out but haters won eventually and shaped the opinions of everyone else,Negative
If you are a true fan of the franchise then you will love this film It looks stunning glossy colourful and plays cleverly with the narrative of the original trilogy and its place in the minds of the characters in this new MatrixIm glad I read the interview with Lana Wachowski explaining where this story came from and the reason she revisited this universe Knowing her reasons allows you to experience the story differently as a beautiful love story of characters that are so obviously important to herI was also impressedrelieved with how the resurrections are explained  even though this is Scifi it made sense and not too farfetched Very clever stitching of the bridge between the original  films and this new story Nothing is erased or apologised for which is awesome and full of integrityGive it a chance,Notr
Please Dont do this to yourself Makes you vomit in your mouth a bit to be honest Lots of people at the theater just straight up walked out and left in the first half hour Im not kidding Spare yourself the pain and dont watch the Emoji movie After we sat through that A man started yelling at the people that worked there that he wanted a refund for his family and said That is not worthy to be called a movie,Negative
Meowch Ive never seen the stage version of Cats but this movie didnt do it any favors The CGI feline humanoids are nightmare fuelcreeping crawling prancing  dancing though a paperthin plot that drops the viewer in the middle of an unfamiliar  unsettling world without any real explanations Its also full of mostly lackluster musical numbers featuring songs with nonsensical lyrics To put it simply this film is litterally a catastrophe,Negative
One of my favourite movies of all time I was in awe after the first time I watched it and I couldnt wait to rewatch it again Ive watched it a total of  times now and I am still so fascinated and intrigued by the storyline in this Obviously Leo is one of the best of all time and my favourite actor Cant get enough,Positive
Complete and total garbage There is absolutely nothing redeemable about this movie Andrew Lloyd Weber must have been out of his mind to sign off on this atrocity And thank you Jennifer Hudson for butchering and botching Memory I guess William Hung and Roseanne Barr couldnt clear their schedules so they hired Jennifer Hudson to ruin the only memorable part of this script Utter garbage,Negative
Everything is said in the title What a disappointment of a film A mess from start to finish It was good to see the return of Sam neill Jeff goldblum and Laura Dern but its not interesting at all I though they could not do any worst than Jurassic World But this is far worse,Notr
I can say this is by far one of the funniest and most cringiest movies ever Although it did surprise me on how well the animation is and the characters are fun and cute At first I wanted to watch this as a joke to enter the theaters with my Emoji pillows and other merch I have but as I got into the movie it actually made sense me thinking I was high wasnt a reality I suggest you take the time to watch it and experience it yourself to see if a movie is good or not,Negative
Amazing film Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie,Positive
I didnt have a single moment of boredom while watching this movieWhen I think about this movie I wonder why,Positive
Unlike the real world this is a strange world Eliots cats are much more lively and sociable with other cats In fact his characters are so unrealistic that you wonder if Eliot ever even came close to any cats The versification is skillful of course But its still the brilliant songs by Andrew Lloyd Webber music  T S Eliot lyrics Most of the cast are good singers  especially Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy and the new song Beautiful ghosts is alright Nothing EXTREMELY wrong with the film as its just as a Jukebox Musical  it literally exists to attempt a narrative around songs so its fair to say that the soundtrack is better than the rest of the film,Negative
A Jurassic Park and Jurassic World mish mash I could go on and on but Im tired after struggling through the movie Using the same old ideas putting the same old actors with some new ones and adding lots of computer graphics does not mean its will be a good movie Bigger dinosaurs with more noise is just BORING I couldnt wait for the movie to end The scariest part of the movie is that it is doing well at the boxoffice so there will probably be another bad sequel Jurassic Universe  or Multiverse Please think it through or just let it die,Notr

First of all the special effects are good I do not understand the negative reviews of this movie and conversely it probably helped me to enjoy it more I though The Batman was grossly overrated and likewise this movie is better than the reviews its receivedSome parts were semi scary and I thought story was decent Its better than the nd venom that is for sure,Notr
I dont agree with the reviews on this movie at all and neither does my  year old daughter I loved the story line as well as the animation I work in the cell phone industry and so felt especially attached to the concept Liked that it brought this element of technology to life,Negative
Simple story and stylish look But the substance is lacking in the product as a whole The editing does not fit with the movie making it feel BGradeCharacters and acting is okay But too many scenes do not follow the rules set by the story and some moments do not make sense or just feel like Here Watch the next partMy claypot nachoes and recliner were my favourite parts of the movie,Notr
"I am not a steady user reviewer in IMDB But felt the need to review this one
As most of us before going to watch it I checked the rating and reviews in IMDB
Wow how many horrible reviews it has received
So I went there prepared to watch one of the worst films I have ever triedThis was not the case though The film is not the average Hollywood musical with a blend of dialogues and songs It is almost just songs Be prepared for that
I have not seen the theatre play so I cannot compare But found this film quite good It is not a fast paced movie It is not intended to
After the half  it becomes more emotional and captivating
I think the movie delivers what it is intended to a theatrical experience of a musical Relying more on the music and lyrics than complex dialogues to transfer the ideas and emotions to the viewer
Succeeded with me",Negative
It is listed as a comedy because it is indeed a joke,Negative
This Movie was absolutely horrible I cant put into words how awful the acting was and the special effects were a joke The story was impossible to follow for both those familiar and unfamiliar with the cartoon simply because it moved too quickly The film was extremely painful to watch I dont understand why Fox would let such a monstrosity into theatersTo put it blankly it was unfit even for a straight to DVD filmIn my opinion this movie may have potential as a high school film festival entry I would advise you all to think twice before you decide to spend your hard earned money to see this movie By the way when I stated that this movie was painful to watch i meant it Not just for Dragonball fanboys either the movie was literally painful to watch I couldnt stop turning in my seat Also Im not a fanboy,Negative
No seriously wheres the iconic Matrix actionIts  and there was better cgi action in This feels more of a knock off than an actual movie inspired from the concepts of the previous filmsMuch disappointment,Notr
i had to wash my eyes out after watching this really awful I admit to being a fan of the cartoon and Ive seen every episode but I was looking forward to this film in full knowledge it would not be the same I have to say as a stand alone film it looked like they were just going through the motions The dialogue was childish and the story had been squished into such a short space No time at all had been taken to write a proper story  they just bastardised the original Goku was a white teenage boy for Christ sakethey should have written a new story that just paid homage to the original coming up with something interesting but instead they ruined an already well developed story i think they just made some cheap rubbish to see if they could get all the dragon ball fans to rent it,Negative
The lack of pacing and an absolute absence of plot depth made watching this a tiring exercise of patience When I wasnt cringing at the stupidly unfunny jokes and product placement I found myself rolling my eyes at the ridiculously predictable dialogue When I wasnt rolling my eyes I was desperately checking the running time which I did about every ten or fifteen minutes Once it was finally over I lied facedown on my bed willing any memories of having watched The Emoji Movie to leave my now much smaller brain However I can now live a far happier life knowing that I will never have to subject my ears and eyeballs to this movie again,Negative
Long boring and predictable movie Since Spielberg created Jurassic Park no one has been able to go further Same format same stupid story same gags in every movie How boring Who says that the dinosaurs every time they have to eat you they have to mwttwrsi to scream like idiots  In the midst of an immense forest how likely are you to encounter a tyrannosaurus And to find  of them all together near the helicopter  In the obsession of surprising in reality you are bored Everything already seen reviewed and seen again  Do you want to surprise Do something more realistic These scripts smell of mold,Notr
Like most i was hyped when this was released but my god what a load of rubbish this was It gained notoriety in the last few years purely because of how awful it is James Wong should be embarrassed and as others have said the story and character changes were unnecessary Ill be fair and say Emmy Rossum was convincing as Bulma with American sass along with Chow YunFat who added a touch of that famously eccentric EastAsian humor its just a pity nothing worked too well outside of that There was so much material to work with and so many story arcs to choose from and the best they could do was make Goku a highschool kid and turn Piccolo into a generic villain of the week I really hope if ever the remake comes into fruition the movie does a better job and utilizes the source material a bit more,Negative
I read review after review of bad this is how there are no dinosaurs how the plot sucksso I thought OK I wont see itbut my son wanted to go so I took himThose reviews were SO OFF There are as many dinosaurs in this as there were in ANY of the JPJW films Its an absolutely blast Its a really fun exciting summer movie How heartfelt and amazing does the plot have to be Its a summer blockbuster and as a fan of the original JP films I thought it was great Dont blindly trust reviews  see for yourself,Notr
I feel that this final film in the saga goes back to the roots of the original Jurassic park It focuses on overreach of the power with technologymainly biotechnology It was a good way to bring the new cast and original together in a way that felt believable Also added a couple of great new characters The realistic true form dinosaurs were quite neat and the touch of nostalgia here and there was great,Notr
Morbius is one of those rare films that has such a bad reputation that upon actually watching I was surprised by how completely palatable if not bland it turned out to be I kept waiting for that scene which would explain all the hate or the endless memes but it never cameUnfortunately there was never any point where the film grabbed my attention either despite some topshelf visual effects The villains origin and motivation made sense but were somehow shallow compared to the protagonist and the ultimate conflict between them was more of a plot contrivance than anything characterdrivenMorbius is not a film I regret watching but its certainly not one that I will return to view again,Notr
If you love Jurassic park and know everything about it and will notice all the Easter eggs from certain parts in the script even to camera angles youll like not love but like this film You can tell they tried really hard to make reference to the original movie here which I appreciated and I enjoyed picking out Easter egg after Easter egg Are there certain parts that dont make sense yes but its Jurassic World does any of it really make sense Who cares just bury the logic and enjoy the ride and have fun with itWith some great callbacks and final resolutions for some story arcs its worth a watch for any Jurassic fan,Notr
I enjoyed it But Just enjoyed The best part of the movie was the return of the original cast Jeff Goldblum of course was phenomenal and fell right back into the role of Ian Malcolm We gotta all be honest here though the first two movies of JP were amazing because they were done by Spielberg and based on the books Everything after just feels like a cheap rip off,Notr
This movie opens another path to think in my mind  inception can be done future,Positive
I just finished Matrix  I would say that the film itself was good Good actors and a decent plot What I struggle to understand was why did they actually make it  It must be to build on and make more films The end was a bit strange And I think it seems strange if they are not going to make a No  I think the end of No  was good enough so what was the point of reviving this universe if you do not build on it So all in all good but not sure why they made it,Notr
Looks like Lana Wachowski decided to take a backseat and let a fanboy take the entire movie Thats how the whole movie was I cringed so hard at the self References that they make throughout the movie Till this movie  I thought that Keanu and Carrie Ann Moss were the backbones of this movie but now  I realised that it is Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving who carried it The action sequences were not fluid as in the first movie Plot wise I felt that this was better than Revolutions but the making was so bland Easily the worst movie in The Matrix franchise,Notr

Where do I even begin First of all this movie has the best plot and the best characters in cinema history Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intresstingNolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense We got the best angles and the feelings that emerged from watching this movie gave me goosebumpsThis is literally the best movie out there and a person needs to have this movie in his or hers watchlist Seriously this is a movie where you dont even think about checking the time on your phone because you are literally soooo invested in the story,Positive
This movie is very funny and hilarious For me it is actually one of the best animated movies Though there may be a few mistakes  its still great I would recommend this movie to anyone  The story was very original When I watched this movie the first time I laughed quite a lot It has certainly lived up to its expectations There will be very few movies that can surpass this movie in jokes and laughs,Negative
"It has taken me  years to get round to watching this and during that time I looked forward more and more to seeing it
Was it worth the waitNOI find it difficult to find anything positive to say but the premise and idea of the film is interesting
That sadly is all its an overblown mess of a movie with no place for a connection to the films characters
A collection of choreographed fight scenes connected by dream science mumbo jumbo and accompanied by a bombastic score does not make an interesting movie

Im just at the intro and Im laughing so hard Considering these are dangerous creatures They are not like bears or lions These are bigger faster and eat much more the goverments would surely contain them and just make another jurassic world island to contain them all rather than making them live freely in the cityHow many people would get eaten  pets tooIm surprised they only have  deaths in the past year too That number would surely be up considering how dangerous the ocean would be  flying as wellThis is like some fanfiction story that bend reality and logic and much worst The rest of the story doesnt help much,Notr

The movies plot doesnt feel contrived While it may be simple and predictable for those of us whove watched hundreds of movies those that have not aka children love the movie The jump scares work the threats seem real and the acting is top notch Yes the actors did amazing given what little they had to work with in a movie about dinosaurs in real lifeCheck your suspension of disbelief at the door and have fun reliving your childhood or creating new memories watching a Jurassic park movie for the first time,Notr
This golden triangle of my favorite director Nolan favorite actor Leo and favorite composer Zimmer creates the most profound cinematic experience of all timeWhat makes Inception so powerful is how it taps into the depths of our own subconscious exploring guilt meaning and relationships in a way that feels deeply personal Few films challenge both the mind and the heart as effortlessly as this one Every frame every note in this world of dreams makes me feel more alive than any other motion picture ever hasThanks to everyone involved for making this masterpiece Im sure that Inception and I will grow old together,Positive
I went into this film with high expectations and they were barely met which is okay This didnt feel like a Jurassic film It felt like a Mission Impossible movie with dinosaurs Theres some call backs to Kenner artwork which felt like a nice touch Jeff Goldblum in my opinion carried this film His character felt the most important You should never go into this film expecting an Oscar winning script These films have never made sense so when you apply realism to this franchise resort it to the dinosaurs I loved the animatronics which made it feel like the first film allot Dont listen to critics and go see this movie If you love dinosaurs and you turn your brain off youll have a great time with friends,Notr
Spectacular and entertaining but no more than that Batman Begins is way better This movie has nothing to add that movie andor original storyBe honest What do you remember about this movie a week after seeing it Just the Joker walking out the exploding hospital I guessNicely done but not Nolan proof Please dont make a third one Christopher youre still one of my favorite directorsSummary go see it for its spectacular actions and thats it Nothing more sorryThis is the required th line,Positive

This film is a train wreck Though it is loaded with a great cast of actors all the performances seem like rehearsals Even Chris Pratt seems to be sleepwalking through this The script is a big mess The direction is lifeless and aimless Bryce Howard is dreadful She always bugs me Other than having beautiful red hair and being Ron Howards daughter its amazing to me that she has a career She really cannot play a convincing character She has the same expression whether being chased by dinosaurs or in romantic scenes with Chris PrattJeff Goldblum is in this for two short scenes and hes the only convincing actor in thisThere is a beautiful D animation at the end with two dinosaurs in a lake at sunset Im giving  stars for the animation,Notr

I went into this movie with low expectations and once this film started it took my expectations strapped it to a rocket and took off This film was by far one of the most creative mindblowing drama driving thrillers that Ive seen in at least  years The acting was very solid on all parts when it came to fear solving problems chemistry and action The score was magnificent dark deep suspenseful and very escalating You find yourself at points of the film on the edge of your seat hoping that all the characters make it through okay especially with their own unique talents and the actors made these characters seem so real that youll have to pinch yourself and make sure that you are not the one that is in the dream world I will see this movie at least  more times and I will not be surprised if it wins one or two Oscars at least,Positive
After reading these reviews I came to the conclusion that  of the  reviewers so far did not actually see the movieWhat they actually did was wait for the movies release then they RAN to their computers to write bad reviews about Why They Hate Sony Pictures and Why They Hate The Idea Of The Movie  without having seen it at allSo dont waste your time reading reviews yet Im going to go watch it anyway I dont expect a major blockbuster mega billions hit why should I Do you,Negative

Unfortunately this movie does not feel like a Matrix movie at all You might think this is some kind of a fan made web series interlaced together to become a movie called Matrix Resurrections and it only bears the name of Matrix for commercial reasonsI would have liked it to be much darker and without some cringe moments at the end of the movieI really liked the idea of how the villain is thinking to keep everything he benefits from alive and it would have been so much better if there was a plot twist at the end of the movieHowever I still want to see the bright side and think that all the characters were dreaming so that what they see is not the reality I hope they make a sequel for this one and right the wrongs by showing us that all we saw was just a dream,Notr

Is The Dark Knight an exceptional Batman movie SureIs The Dark Knight the third greatest movie of all time as ranked by IMDbs top   as in better than Schindlers List better than Return of the King better than The Good The Bad and the Ugly better than The Matrix The Empire Strikes Back you know the actual masterpieces of cinema history Hahahahahaha Please Dont patronize meSorry not sorry I am not prepared like legions of others on the bandwagon to give a good but not great movie extra brownie points simply because a member of the supporting cast sadly passed away hyping the films notorietyThe Dark Knight is no better or worse a movie than its prequel or its sequel Overall its a solid and enjoyable trilogy but this movie is barely in the top  movies let alone top  of all time,Positive
So for all the heaters out ther just stop it It was pretty entertaining and was fun to watch Was it necessary Did it add anything meaningful to the story Nop Completly unnecessary But it was not a wast of money and I had a good time So yeah go watch it and have a good time as well,Notr
In my personal view any person in the world who understands English would never say some thing wrong about this movie If some does understands English and still says something wrong about this movie it means he has not seen the movie If some one understands English and has seen this movie as well and still he says something bad about this movie it means he has a really bad taste regarding movies or he does not know what a movie is According to me these kind of people should be hanged to death This movie has changed the life of thousands of people around the world I dont think that any one having a little bit of intellectual level would dislike this movie,Positive
I mean what else can i say i cant remember laughing so much at something being so bad if youre in for a laugh this is the film for you,Negative
An incredibly unique film which deserves its plaudits purely for the intelligent world created Whilst extremely complex the science allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene It keeps you engaged throughout and I think  youre routing for the right people although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak possibly skimmed over and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreamsVisually it cannot be faulted and the pairing with the music works excellently as well Youre constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing more interesting than compelling Having said that it is really one of a kind at least at this level and so everyone should see Inception if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into,Positive
Best movie ever along the lines of Baby Geniuses The Garbage Pail Kids and Deathbed The bed that eats people,Negative
Snubbed from the oscars Brilliant storytelling excellent characters prestigious acting Was disappointed Didnt have enough poop jokes The poop jokes were always funny and never out of place Personally believe this deserved a trilogy,Negative
I really like this movie  It was very well done and the screen play was great  Totally awesome plot and the best acting I have ever saw  I would recommend this movie to anyone  It was a movie to die for  You could tell that they put time and efffort into making this masterpiece,Positive
This movie is one of my all time favorites Undoubtedly one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen Story cast screenplay all are great The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing and couldnt be more accurate It was narrated by Morgan Freeman who is the best narrator in Hollywood I believe Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels It will change the way u think about things around u Surely It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a mans bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hopeI can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen  or ever will see If you havent watch it yet just GO Watch it Now,Positive
After seeing this with my father who saw the trilogy  times now we were both satisfied The action was cool and the plot was intruiging The callbacks to the older movies were also pretty coolNow of course it isnt as good as the first movie none of the sequels are But I believe that this one is as rewatchable as the others,Notr
Matrix  is so boring It feels as if was written and directed by Woody Allen Too many long useless sentimental conversations The action scenes are pathetic clichs in which there is no emotion whatsoever The story is terrible and is clearly intended to promote the leftist agenda relegating Neo the white male to the role of a useless jerk,Notr
"Morbius displays the worst of modern cinema money over quality With a simple common but interesting plot the film wastes all its potential because it rushes everything The characters are really a hit or a miss some of them make unbelievably bad decisions The pace is good in the first two acts however in the final act the movie is shaken by rerecordings which becomes evident as there are scenes out of place Not to mention the dialogue
The action is weak strange effects sloppy editing terrible choreography and unnecessary slow motions joined by an unoriginal soundtrackGenerally performances were good Jared Leto is far from being the movies problem and Matt Smith is wronged by lack of character development villainAlthoug enterteining this film suffers from poor writing sloppy editing post production issues and the need to rush everything to promote future projects same old mistakes Sony continues to produce failure after failure",Notr
This is the best movie I have ever seen The cinematography and screenplay were superb the voice acting was incredible and I felt like I was on the phone throughout the whole film There is no way this movie wont win Oscars for best picture director animated movie and all other categories,Negative

I wanted to like this film as Im a HUGE fan of the other Matrix films This was just a mess from start to finish The user ecsecs summed it up quite nicelyThis is probably the last time Ill be visiting the movies as a whole Hollywood have now proven beyond an absolute doubt that they can no longer make movies,Notr
At Cornell University they have an incredible piece of scientific equipment known as the tunneling electron microscope Now this microscope is so powerful that by firing electrons you can actually see images of the atom the infinitesimally minute building blocks of our universe Reader if I were using that microscope right now I still wouldnt be able to locate my interest in this movie Thank you for your attention ,Negative
Many of the most powerful stories are the soulful ones that teach us not to despair not to be swamped by sorrow They remind us that  hope is a precious and buoyant emotion that can give our lives substance and meaning Most people who see this movie for the first time are not going to appreciate it completely I feel that it is quite possible the best movie ever made Some may be more entertaining like say Indian Jones and the last Crusade but none as compelling The movie shows a world of different emotions mainly through its two main characters Red and Andy The acting is incredible The message is stronger than that of most any movie and is stated very clearly  Hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever does After being drained by the sad events that occur in the movie the ending uplifts and thoroughly fulfills the gap that it could leave you withI believe that one reason that this movie is under appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times At first viewing it is the story of Andy and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances However this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks Because of Andy Red can find different path of freedom that is lit by hope No matter what circumstances you live in dont forget that hope is the best thing in the world And you will have courage to struggle to forward and to live better in the world,Positive
Worst movie ever even Micheal Bay movies are better,Negative
I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption Shawshank encompasses friendships hardships hopes and dreams And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you it gives you hope Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different you dont feel that far removed from what the characters are going throughIt is a simple film yet it has an everlasting message Frank Darabont didnt need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film the narration and the acting does that for him Why this movie didnt win all seven Oscars is beyond me but dont let that sway you to not see this film let its ranking on the IMDbs top  list sway you let your friends recommendation about the movie sway youSet aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie,Positive
I saw the ratings here on IMDB and waited for it to stream instead of seeing it in theaters I regret that decision It was a fairly decent movie Id say that the story line used a lot of elements that Ive already seen in other movies and wasnt original such as the evil corporation Also the movie was a bit too long I was expecting more of an End of the World vibe and it was certainly lacking in that department That being said it doesnt deserve less than a six rating I give it a seven I love that they brought back so many actors from the original Jurassic Park and the urban scenes were really cool There just needed to be more and they just barely missed the mark,Notr
The mindbending qualities of this film remind the viewer that your perception is everything Christopher Nolan has let this concept mature in his mind for nearly ten years Something so carefully crafted and matured deserves to be commended The films plots subplots and back stories may confuse the viewer at first but Nolan does everything he can to make this world as clear as the dreams within it The ensemble cast is the most solid I have seen since The Lord of the Ring Trilogy They are so convincing and so into their roles I felt so connected to the main characters portrayed by Leo DiCaprio and Ellen Page After the film was over the audience got up and left We all strangers began discussing the film and figuring out what it all meant My words to a potential viewer do not think you are intellectually below this movie You will get it and what you dont is impossible to understand Even Christopher Nolan could not tell you what it all means My final thought I am reluctant to pay to see movies especially at nonmatine price I jumped right on this film and it was entirely worth it Favorite Film of the Summer Stars Two Thumbs Up Hey Mikey He Likes It,Positive
This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick It has a great and deep message This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hopeOther than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever He was inspiring intelligent and most of all positive His performance just made me smile Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd Red Redding played by Morgan Freeman Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Reds group James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been institutionalized The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates some of which deserve a second chance Whatever you do dont listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever It has everything you could possibly want,Positive
"Its fascinating but a little bit boring
The idea was great and unique The actors does well  the futuristic emphasis on the dreams and the ability to jump into your subconscious mind was confusing and scary although its still not reality thank god I can say I had great time but I wont repeat it",Positive
This film is really an amazing movie timeless One of my all time favorites About the longcan write something in a movie Masters said everything I needed There is not yet aware of the movie and I watched it for people to watch I would like to inviteThan YouShawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively And James Whitmores portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film As well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it As I bet youll want to see this one more than once,Positive
For as much action as there is in this movie its the acting that makes it a great piece of work Between all the explosions and stuntwork is some great dialog work All the actors have their momentsPerfect directing perfect story perfect balance between action and drama everything is perfectexcellent movie ever the joker character was outstanding the heath ledger gives excellent performance in this movieand the best music work by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howardthis is a blockbuster movie of GENIUS AT WORK by Christopher NolanThe Dark Knight gets a MASTERPIECE  of  stars,Positive
Watching this film made me think about the genre of prisonmovies and what the theme really is in these stories All of them seem to have some common elements the warden is a psychopath there is almost always some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way there is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the human spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances And maybe that is what shawshank wants to tell us that the strong individual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means In this story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure visits in the hole many times without developing psychiatric phenomena In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a piece of fiction as lets say starwars is It is simply not possible to stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if you live in constant fear The movie is highly entertaining but should not be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison environment where inmates are treated as garbage Dont fool yourself on this account Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of Andy Dufresne isRegards SimonPs When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist If you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews,Positive
If you like movies like Mortal Kombat DOA Death or Alive you should watch this I think is quite entertaining There are nothing special with this movie but at this time with all good action movie is still waiting to come out this is worth a trip to a theater near you What else can I say so my comment is pass the minimum lines and can be post If you have little nephew or son or brother between ages    they will like this movie bring them along so you can enjoy more as they comment or pointing to screen Also on the plus side the fight scene is much much better than Charlies Angel although that not say much Chow Yun Fat certainly make the movie more alive but I wish he have more part in itPS should there be a sequel I will watch it,Negative

Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDbs alltime best  films everThe casting is superb Morgan Freeman is Red a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate whos made connections so he can get contraband to other inmates for a price hes under a life sentence for murder Tim Robbins is Andy a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to  life terms for killing his wife and her lover which helike most other inmates say theyre not guilty of And Bob Gunton is Warden Norton who when we first meet him is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline While fortunately Ive had no first hand experience Shawshank certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its societyA long movie most of it takes place inside a semicorrupt state penitentiary in the late s Red in talking his thoughts out loud to himself becomes our narrator for many developments As the story unfolds increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations And in Andys work for Warden Norton we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral characterall show and appearance and with no integrity substanceIn Roger Eberts first review of his two of this movie he said the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth despite everythingthe word redemption is in the title for a reason Most viewers will agree,Positive

"OK it was an enjoyable movie for a rainy afternoon So comfortable but I have trouble remembering the actual plot now its people we care about and rogue dinosaursyou should know what youre getting into by now Thankfully no running in high heelsI did spend a lot of time worrying about the corn Bryce Dallas Howard was shucking when she had to run after the dinos It was a perfect looking cob of corn Bright yellow Luscious

The movie was good from the beginning and it has a very intriguing plot along with some good action scenes I did find it a bit hard to follow sometimes but I eventually knew what was going on most of the time You need to be really focus when watching the movie and possibly watch it more than once to understand it fully,Positive

This film is probably the best lifeinprison film ever made  It depicts one mans time in the big house for something he supposedly didnt do This man is Andy Dusfresne pronounced Duframe played in his best ever Tim Robbins  But he isnt alone he is joined by fellow inmate who is the only guilty person in Shawshank Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman Freeman narrates the life in The Shawshank prison all the way up until the end not to mention some very memorable escape scenes  Very memorable showing what movies are made of  Based on Stephen Kings novel one of his best and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont who  years later would write and direct the Green Mile another good but cant be matched to this one prison movie  A,Positive

This bloated and soggy piece of work is so far from earning a number  spot on the IMDb that I have to imagine that Stephen King has bought votes for it Trite  mawkish shallow unconvincing ugly How much more can I say about its awfulness Morgan Freeman is tolerable Tim Robbins is not There is a romantic glow to the cinematography that is really inappropriate if the main characters are heterosexual If they arent there is an unexplored subtext poisoning the base of the movie There is nothing else about this movie that makes a lick of sense emotional dramatic logical racial penological Rips off the Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and cheapens and flattens them Its appeal escapes me utterly For the love of God sink this film,Positive

My favorite movie was really The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank RedemptionA lot of people would might disagree with but I love this movie the actors are great the director has done a fantastic job and the screenplay is magnificentI was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director The acting was worldclass I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since Morgan Freeman maybe eg Seven The twists were unexpected an although this film had a familiar feel it wasnt even slightly pretentious or clichd it was original The cinematography was grand and expressive It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prisonI remember when i saw the movie I didnt want to get up and go to the toilet When I finally was done in the bathroom I couldnt wait to get back and press play on my DVD At the time I was done with the movie I wanted to see the movie againThis film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichs and predictability Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities These artists show their capability to produce art real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you The Shawshank Redemption delivers muchneeded breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget So see it buy it love it,Positive
I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie Instead I got a profound chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan good vs evil and socialpolitical and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful brilliant fil experience it wasI was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie Ive now seen it at least  times and I still get the same feeling This is big budget blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages a top  movie of alltime,Positive
Cats  makes Pet Semetary  look like a comedy What an absolute mess this movie was CGI at its worst,Negative
The Dark Knight is one of those movies that resonate in people so much that they are a true and avid believer in the Joker  Batman himself It is one of the best movies I have ever seen The only way the joker can see himself as credible is if he does things his way without hesitation The Batman is his nemesis  does everything he can to stop him The bat mobile is the perfect example of why the cutting edge tech in this movie is still viable to this day and the future ahead I see myself in the Joker and I also see myself in the Batman Much training was necessary for the Batman to fully evolve into the walking batsuited mastermind himself The Joker will always be remembered as the villain  Batman will always be there to save the night,Positive
Even though It has low rating and Is made fun of a lot It was actually enjoyable I watched this movie with my friend In theaters and I was thinking It would be an awful movie that I could make fun of but then It was actually pretty enjoyable There are a few kinda cringy parts such as some of the dancing scenes but it was still an enjoyable movie My serious rating ,Negative
I dont have one complaint about this movie I could watch it every day Has the perfect amount of action comedic relief suspense and drama Will always be a  from me,Positive

Im not sure I can be as creative with my review as others I would just say DONT DO IT Releasing a version with improved CGI will NOT make this less of a flop Its tried to be arty but is just terribly freaky Crying shame We left  mins in as did  others Wish Id gone to see Star Wars with the hubby instead,Negative
If theres lower than  rating i would give it to this flop movie This movie ruined the Dragonball name Every details of movie is so Fed up Hollywood please pleaseplease Dont ever try to make movies about anime ever again We anime lovers dont like changing the stories from Manga to anime to live action movie We want to see how will it evolved from paper to real And not messing the whole story and changed it to your ownEven the costumes of the characters are so messed up Hollywood just stick messing with Dc and marvel movies Dont touch anime ever again So ill give a  vote out of  So awful that after seeing it i puke,Negative

Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins bides his time during twenty years imprisonment for the murder of his wife in this adaptation of a Stephen King story And being Stephen King the setting is once again Maine though youll find Shawshank State Prison in Ohio Its the forbiddingly Gothic Mansfield Reformatory  Reformatory Road Mansfield on US Route  about  miles southwest of ClevelandBuilt between  and  the reformatory remained in operation until  and was scheduled for demolition when the film was made In fact much of the prison yard has now gone to make room for the adjacent Richland Correctional Institution but the striking Administration Building lives on as a tourist attraction Find it just north of downtown Mansfield off South Olivesburg Road,Positive
It was amazing I Laughed harder watching this than any other animated film I have ever seen recently Sausage party comes close I can watch this with my nieces who are toddlers and we would all enjoy it Most of the jokes are for a mature audience I admit but they were spot on Kids might not appreciate poop punching a fan but they would love the colors and shapes and funny gimmicks the parents who brought the kids to the theater would get big laughs It doesnt matter how much critics pan this movie numbers speak for themselves it opened in over  theaters They dont do that unless the movie has wide market appeal If you didnt like it It wasnt meant for you Plain and simple,Negative

I have submitted several reviews over the years but this is my first one starI have given Cats one star due to a scene that literally made me feel nauseous fat cat eating cockroachesPost WWII audiovisual torture techniques were developed They were designed to induce nausea I truly believe by pure chance Cats has happened upon some of these  It should genuinely be looked into In many of the Cats reviews people use phrases like fever dream  bad trip  I believe its no coincidence,Negative
I was so excited to see this movie and it was so so disappointing CGI was like a low budget indie for Netflix Acting was the same You could have gone out and gotten better performances from a high school productionThe screenwriters should be banned from ever being allowed to write anything ever again EverNo story terrible acting terrible special effects Only redeeming quality was some amazing stuntsWhat a disappointing end to such a great franchise,Notr

The Shawshank Redemption is the BEST movie of all time for many reasons The first reason being that Morgan Freeman did his best acting job and that is saying something Freeman is the greatest actor of all time Secondly Tim Robbins gets so into his part you feel like the story is totally true and you are actually seeing it first hand The supporting actors are wonderful as well Enough about the acting which was second to none but the story was so compelling The audience feels sympathy for the main character and wishes for him to be redeemed in the end its just a feel good story I cannot express this enough GO WATCH THE MOVIE NOW It is awesome and will never be topped,Positive
This movie surprised me so much I watched it twice in one day the first time I saw it Sure I hadnt just picked a movie at random at the local DVDshop but I didnt expect it to be so good After I watched it I had a look on the IMDb website and was surprised once again that i found it placed number  on the top  movies list I wondered to myself why didnt I know about this movie Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite wellknown actors Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in  when the Green Mile was released Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television because it surely isnt on television often enough or it could just be me not knowing very much about the filmworld before  For in fact everyone in my school seemed to have known the Shawshank Redemption for a very long time One of the best movies ever my best friend said My favorite movie in the whole wide world another one of my friends THEN WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME I replied If you liked the Green Mile Im telling you now youll love this,Positive
The Dragonball series had sooooo much potential to be an excellent live action franchise The series has a loyal fan base and the action of DB would appeal to any movie lover but in order for this to happen the franchise must be handled by people who know what the HELL DRAGONBALL was about This garbage isnt Dragonball this movie is more closer to High School musical than it is to DB You can tell the writers of this crap werent fans of the series because the only similarities between DB and this movie is the Title and some Character names I am not going to place the blame on the actors because it isnt their fault that the writing and casting sucked How are going to have a white Goku Thats like having a Japanese SupermanIt doesnt make senseBut yea dont waste you time with this one,Negative

It is a complete disgrace It is a steaming pile Im ashamed to introduce this movie to my friends who havent watch the original series How dare the director make our childhood series become a twilight Im so insulted by this even the original DBZ creator was so angered he started making DBS which is not as good as DBZ but its still worth watching compared to dragon ball evolution I have a better name for this movie Ill call it Disgraceful balls of Emostuff This is my st time writing a review which I dont ever do other than rate movies but this movie angered me to the point I cant take it anymore thats why Im writing this review I got news they even made some merchandise to milk out more money as if this movie isnt bad enough,Negative
Its just amazing that no dinosaur hasnt bitten it off yet In what promises to be the conclusion to the series all the main cast members of the previous shows are here Alan Grant Ellie Sattler I actually liked the new characters DaWanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie better than the old ones  they are the only ones that come out of this unscathed The special effects are as expected first class although really A Gigilomopoloposaurus  they just keep getting bigger the dinosaurs AND the names Not sure that its worth the Hollywood BlvdTimes Sq ticket prices   but its an okay way to spend a summer afternoon I think tho Id wait til next weekend when the crowds will be  less,Notr
I put off seeing this movie for a whole twentyeight years for the reason that I thought the movie was overrated Today I saw this movie  its a masterpiece Even after almost  years the movie looks fresh it conveys very important human themes and makes you thinkMorgan Freeman is a true example of how an actor should be acting in our yearsFor the sake of this movie are obliged to enter a score of eleven because all the tens that I put are not deserved in front of this movieJoy regret tears I recommend this movie to literally every person on this planet You will definitely not regret it,Positive
Ok people are gonna not like me for this but I kinda like this movie The movie is not like the worst thing ever compare to other terrible movies like Norm Of The North or Where The Dead Go To Die A  isnt really the rating this movie deserves,Negative
"The plot is not exactly stellar however the performances are good and the jokes are funny and smart
It is relevant to the present even though not exaclty easy to relate to the characters
The message of the movie is also a nice one inspirational and motivational
In any case the movie does not have any serious flaws rhat would make it a  stars movie it hds the storyline together and coherent as said it is smart and funny
If you came across on this movie on TV do not chnage the chanel it is worth the watch",Negative
Theres no way this director ever watched an episode of this cartoon The actors were awful choices for the characters they played Apparently Piccolo has the same powers as Darth Vader Force Grip Yamcha was pretty cool in the cartoon this guy is possibly the biggest tool I have ever seen in my life There is no possible way to make this movie any worse I dont know whats more embarrassing having a part in the creation of this movie or the fact that i have spent an hour and a half watching the whole thing I kept watching in hopes of something happening to redeem it slightly but nothing happened Hands down the worst interpretation imaginable of something great,Negative
The Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself It is not about a person in prison it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by God I watched the movie for the first time some months ago That evening I was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay home Being unhappy about that I started watching the movie on the TV just by chance not knowing about its existence before that at all At first I was skeptic I admit that But oh God at the end of it I was screaming and jumping in my room at  AM It gave me so much emotions and so much hope I had never felt before that I could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way  so excited so happy about my life leaving me believing so much in my own self It is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do In The Shawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak just the opposite  gives you wings to fly away from fear fly closer and closer to freedom Morgan Freemans voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive Tim Robbins act is just beyond perfection I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or just bad about something I watch the movie It has become my personal shrink making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it Can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after  years,Positive
Nollan brings us a Batman that is totally real and possible Any thing happening in this movie is possible to happen of screen Batman has no super powers we all know either do the villains Batman is a man using technology and intelligence as a base for his skills Every line in the movie is plausible The casting is flawless quite well selected in entire trilogy Christian Bale show his chameleon skills going from Bruce to Batman as fast and certain as you can flip a coin Tha usually romantic Aaron Eckheart is also broken in two and instead of switching from edges he mergeem resulting in the only Harvey Two Face in the cinema that could be taken seriously Heath Leadger acting is one of the most amazing things you could see in your entire life It makes you wonder Jack Nicholson who This is the kind of movie that plays on my screen every once in a while,Positive
"My personal all time favorite movieEverything about this movie is so perfect The acting the plotline the idea behind the plot the action the emotion the adrenaline the soundtrack the look Such a beautifully well crafted movie that I keep understanding new things each time I rewatch it I personally am more of an action kind of moviewatcher so keep that bias in mind
The movie admittedly is difficult to understand the first time you watch it but is still quite enjoyable But I love how the movie gets more enjoyable as you rewatch it There are so many movies that Im like eh watched it solid wouldnt really care to watch again but this movie isnt made up of the movie junk food thats in most movies",Positive
I cannot phrase it better so I will quote Rex Reed who called Inceptions storyline prattling drivel A friend claimed Inception is a thinking persons movie but a thinking person will realize that it is only masquerading as a thinking persons movie At bottom intellectually there is no there there Add to this that someone clearly believed the film needed to be pumped up with overwrought drama to qualify it as a summer blockbuster I couldnt wait for it to end and when it did the intrusiveness of the loud schlocky music over the closing credits seemed to crystallize all the incipient negative feelings I had been having throughout the movie I hope that this director will go back to doing smaller films that do not stretch his concepts beyond what they can support,Positive
"Okay so I love musicals and cats the animals Never seen the musical I went into this movie with a VERY open mind Let me tell you this film was dreadful in absolutely every respect
There is zero storylineNO character development I dont actually think there are charactersThe CGI is appalling and overusedThe songs are forgettableThe dancing is CGId for the vast majority of the filmThe singing is spoken with the exception of  bars of Memory the highlight of the movieThere is no development of anything just one song straight into the next song with no explanation of where the plot is going or whyI have NO clue what the film is actually aboutI watched the entire film with my hands over my face and almost feeling angry for putting myself through it A truly bad movie",Negative
Stellar proformence from every actoractress Heath ledger was truly a fantastic actor and no one will ever top his joker if you are into super hero movies or really any movie I believe you will love this one I highly recommend,Positive
Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver performances worthy of cinematic heaven No where do we spot the intention of their performances only the gradual development of a friendship that transcends race age and social classThe line between guilty and innocent although blurred amongst the inmates is animated by the corrupt guards and the abysmal treatment of men who have sand piles on their weary shouldersRedemption is the predominate theme as well as perseverance and friendship through situation Biblical undertones pervade Robbins bears oppression that angers the viewers until the redemptive secret is revealedThe institution the jail as metaphor for society often succeeds The instituional man cannot survive beyond the social structure behind the walls He is a lost soul without the community of thieves and murderers that defines his existence What is a man but a success amongst his peers One of the best films of the twentieth century,Positive
"This movie is pure trash Its just so sad that a bunch of people came in and thought this was a good idea The whole movie is one big ad
and its literally trying to make a full on scene just by making ads I cant believe someone just sat there and thought No ones gonna notice the ads I just feel really bad for all the people who had to suffer watching this movie Im just so sadHumanity is doomedReally humanity is gonna get nowhere with this kind of Movie Seriously how can you even consider this a movie and not just one fat adAlso The Emoji Movies storyboard feels like it was written for  minutes until they pitched the idea Just one fat try to make money by advertising companies in an awful MovieIf you ask me the poop emoji shouldve been the main character because he represents this Movie amazingly  At least I can laugh at all the jokes they make off this Movie",Negative
I wonder why all the hate and awful reviews of this movie This was actually really good Most of the bad reviews I read sounded like haters of either Jared Leto or of the genre If Marvel wants to try some horror to pull in new viewers it works I just watched it and I dont watch ANY superhero flicks Just not my thing I dont hate on them I just dont get the pull Plus its really difficult to put together a good vampire werewolf or monster flick without worn out tropes and it coming off as cheesy and cliche Anyhow I liked it and I hope Marvel does more Its also another movie that proves you should never trust online opinions and just watch it for yourself,Notr
Im not going to even try to explain the story but Inception proves that a movie can be a successful action blockbuster a philosophical lesson and a story about grief and overcoming it all in one Inception is a brilliant movie and is Christopher Nolan at his best,Positive
I dont know why people and critics are saying this is the worst marvel or any comic book movie I guess these people and critics havent seen Venom  Eternals Batman vs Superman Suicide Squad and so onThis movie had a simple logical story yes it wasnt the best or predictable but it was decent The visual effects and acting was goodWe got what we wanted but nothing moreSo overall this movie delivered what was expected thats it and that wasnt enough for people and critics,Notr

From oustanding and visionary The Matrix through medicore Reloaded and Revolutions to this fake that should not be called Matrix In my opinion this movie should not exist This movie is like turtle trying to follow and catch rabbit  I cannot understand why and for what I do not recommend its a waste of time,Notr
This movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen Morgan Freeman gives an unbelievable performance in this work The direction of it is exquisite and gives much to Tim Robbins character I know he is a good actor but the direction gives so much more to him  The soundrack is unparalleled and the story is exquisite thanks to Stephen King  I have seen many greats Citizen Kane The Godfather Cuckoos Nest The Deer Hunter Apocalypse Nowetc This movie is fantastic and the fact it didnt win or even get nominated for an Oscar is the reason I dont pay attention to the Oscars anymore This movie is fantastic and an artistic triumph I have no respect for the Academy for ignoring this flick,Positive
"It is a movie where all the aspects of a movie are done upto perfection From the characters to the way the characters are developed through the storyline is out of the world

To conclude this movie itself is a Masterpiece",Positive
Seeing it rated as the third best movie of all time by IMDb voters and ranking up huge box office I thought Id give it a swingI mostly wish I hadnt bothered Like most superhero movies nowadays its one gigantic battleship of a movie weighed down by its humongous budget and massive running time How many subplots do we need How many conflicted characters staring into the depths of their pompous souls Visually  great And the vfx crew have to be credited for some of the most seamless and impressive work ever done on the city the batmobile the bat bike etc Brilliant stuffBut the story the script the pacing  all pretty blaah Did I give a damn about any of the characters Did I really care what was going to happen next Nope Did I actually know what was going on half the time what with the various criminals their money the money laundering guy the Joker the various Police Departments what the hell is County No no no Boring I was actually looking at my watchThe one intriguing episode in the film  with the ferries  is shoved in three quarters of the way through the film and unceremoniously dumped once it has served its purpose in sticking other bits of the film togetherSo all in all I wish Id spent the time some other way,Positive
Its like the movie See you yesterday Thats about it,Negative
Christopher Jonathan James Nolan has made some brilliant movies in his not so long directorial life Inception is just an addition to his quiver of mind blowing films It is so good to watch a film like Inception which strives and manages to dream big without giving up on the cerebral portion of film makingInception has a plot that is best left unexplained and untainted but I do have to admit it is one of Chris Nolans most non complicated movies I still think his best was in Following and Memento This film is brilliant but somehow you have a feeling that he is holding back not pulling all punches It seems almost tailored for the Iron Man and Transformers audience I can understand it not being too vague but I do feel that Inception has been over simplified thus losing a bit of its shine in the process But trust me it is still going to be the most engrossing big movie of the year and it is an awesome watch Its just that it does not challenge the viewer as much as some of Nolans previous movies did and that is something I missed during watching this film But then i guess its understandable with a budget of  milOn the acting front brilliant performances from everyone and its a delight to see Michael Kane in a two bit role Leo DiCaprio reprises a role similar to his role in the recent Shutter Island and is just as good Marion Cotillard is shimmering and sensuous as Leos wifeOverall a great intriguing movie to watch but still does not overwhelm Nolans best films which continue to be his initial movies,Positive
Dont have the words to describe it You just cant unseen it,Negative
This is the first of the JW trilogy that actually resembles the legendary brilliance of the original JP in certain forms While it still does suffer from certain clichs and scattered random plot choices its definitely the most chaotic and entertaining since the original The dinosaurs are more fearsome than ever and definitely make the ride that much more intriguing with cgi that is highly precise The old and new cast blending works fairly well Though can be somewhat forced at times with the comic relief The original actors definitely add that bit of fan service we all know would come along with them I still dont think this trilogy was as good as it couldve been it does close out in a very solid fashion,Notr
I honestly dont get the hate I only knew some info about the stage play and this is exactly why I expected IDK if most people just didnt know what this was gonna be It isnt a great musical But there are definitely worse movies out there,Negative
The Dark Knight isnt just a movie its a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre leaving a lasting mark on the world of film Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker is legendary He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing Christopher Nolans vision coupled with Heath Ledgers unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic,Positive
I am a fan of Dragon Ball and the is the worst thing I have seen in my whole life how could he how This is not even Dragon Ball no actor looks even a bit like the real Dragon Ball cartoon characters no goku no bulma no piccolo no Mr roshi this is fooool Even the the fighting is nothing more than a little feminine kids trying to fight and worst of all there are guns oh my goodness I am going crazy and what the fin SUPER SAIYAN GOKU is bullied by earthlings and who this actor taking Gokus role think he is just give me one  reason why would this be goku what a mockery this is not dragonball story in any way and if who did this is planning on another movie he better not Just if we meet  er One last word if you think you cant bring a fighting scene just like in the real Dragon Ball I say you stay at home dont think that because you added a good effects this is dragonball no no no Thanks whoever reading this ,Negative

Cats is incredibly surreal Its barely a movie I dont know what it isNow dont get me wrong it was hilarious The wonky facial expressions lingering songs and downright creepy mannerisms were quite the hoot Almost all of the audience was there to laugh at the movie For good reason There were two people in the theater who were taking it seriously a young couple on a date Oops thats a poor choice of movies but they turned around by the end of the film and started chucklingIts so strange how a piece of media like this can exist Despite how unwatchable it is the movie was weirdly hypnotizing Well I guess we are one with the jellicles now Whatever that means,Negative
Without spoiling anything I can just say that this movie is a unbroken chain of commercials If commercials were tumors then this movie would be with fullbody spread terminal cancerThe only redeeming fact is that Patrick Stewart does a voiceover I can only hope they paid him well,Negative
I enjoyed this film been waiting to watch it for a while now before the release dates were delayed several times  was something different for me new character new powers new anti hero felt like I was watching Dracula Untold the CGI and the story line was awesome Ill rate this  looking forward in watching it again when it releases on Blu Ray I like the fact that was a thriller horror Sci  think it was way better than The Eternals The eco location super power I enjoyed as well,Notr
the already ruined the movie by not sticking with the original come on now i am not being a racist or anything like that but stick with the program why didnt you place an Asian guy as Goku Mr director i have watched dragon ball z anime religiously since i was a kid and for you to add that small little feature to it just ruined it i wonder what the Asians think of this even my friends who are American thinks this was ridiculous and i hope that if there is another dragon ball z project that someone elsell pick it up and stick with the original Why do you cast agentsdirectors feel the need to change everything just because you need to americanize it Everyone loves the original so please stick to it stop ruining the great quality of the filmanime please,Negative

Its really really really bad it tries too hard to be funny and fails miserably It is most definitely one of the worst animated movies ever madeIncredibly frustrating experienceMustnotwatch,Negative
First off Jared Leto isnt my first choice as an actor at all and before the movie I was honestly skeptical of him being the lead actor but this is probably hands down one of his best acting movies Ive seen him play Hes typically a supporting role in bigger movies but he killed it as the main character I dont understand the hate around this movie Yes it couldve been at least  minutes longer with more action scenes but for a SonyMarvel movie they did a great job and was up to pare with their other movie Venom I believe this movie deserves a lot better ratings then what its receiving and I definitely believe its worth the watch,Notr
I find it surprising that this movie has such a low rating if you actually sit down and take it for what it is its a great kids movie Its funny its bright it has a message What more do you want My  year old amd my  year old like it,Negative
Theres a reason this is rated the   It is the same reason you watch this movie every time you see it on tv even if its already half way over Its captivating brilliant and full of heart Its one of the best films ever made,Positive
This film is nothing but one cliche after another Having seen many of the s of prison films made from the early s to the s I was able to pull almost every minute of Shawcrap from one of those filmsWhile it is visually well made and acted the story has every plot point of the standard prison film They have the evil warden innocent main character friendly guilty guy thugs and one good old prisoner Dont waste your time on this one Rent or buy some of the classics of the prison genre,Positive
My favorite review of this movie so farIf Dante had seen this movie he would have included it as the th circle of hell,Negative
This is Tim Robbins best performance ever It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent manAndy Dufresbe who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life He meets a mentor in RedMorgan Freeman and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners but also of the prison guards Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away,Positive

This movie was basically a propaganda piece The whole plot characters and story line was just dire and completely unsuitable for young children watching None of my children enjoyed the film which is not surprising At the end you were left with a weird unsatisfied feeling that the film had achieved nothing and that was because the characters had achieved nothingAgain we see the result of basically feminist bs being fed into a film and because they have been rejected and have ultimately failed in their love life they appear to want characters in films they have influence over to do the same thing Some of the dialogue from the female lead character was also deeply unsuitable for children of a young age,Negative
This movie taught me to never lose hope The sheer dedication persevere and sheer will to stay so long in the jail and do well It teaches humans to be humans and not losing hope and facing the issues instead of giving up  procrastinating and when life beats you down you get up and face it and not lose hope ever Many people can be your foes but you fake it till you make it I will never forget this movie and its teaching of continously adapting to the new changes instead of giving up The friendship in the movie despite the age gap teaches about how communication can be so fruitful to the new generation and old generation to maximise human relationships So this movie is the best lesson that has happened to me,Positive
Saw this movie last night and I cannot fathom the negative reviews Because frankly its about as good as say any of these animated movies Its on par with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs or Wreck it RalphSure its by the numbers but newsflash  they ALL AREIt looked great it was funny  enough  and it had just enough charm To clarify it succeeded by ticking all the boxes with the bare minimum but its so similar to movies of its kind I cannot understand why its rated so lowBecause if you liked Bee Movie youre going to like this OK so its not quite as well rounded as Bee Movie or in fact any of the successful animated movies but its certainly not far offUltimately its a silly  minutes  and thats all it was ever supposed to beI was pleasantly surprised,Negative
To be honest my expectations werent high Revivals after two decades almost never fair well This film spends a lot of time displaying flashbacks of the original trilogy scenes to earn brownie points with OG fans but this new installment doesnt bring anything new to the table as far as science fiction is concern It just reiterates the original story with an added gamingprogrammer side story of which there are countless on Netflix They even rehash some of the original special effects again into this filmThis installment turns into a romance between Neo and Trinity where Neo tries to recapture a lost love Probably the only good thing about the film was some of the martial arts fighting between Neo and Morpheus But thats not enough to make this film worth rewatchingThe film is a letdown And producers let Keanu Reeves get some muchneeded sleep He looked like he was half asleep in all of his scenes,Notr
Dont read a single iota of plot about this Watch it What I will tell you is that DiCaprio may not have been better and is getting better the older he gets the rest of the cast are amazing especially Tom Hardy and GordonLevitt the cinematography is at times breathtaking Hans Zimmers score is intoxicating with Johnny Marr on guitar and it travels across continents like a Bond movie Oh yeah and its really really loud in parts But this is about Christopher Nolan again He has crafted a serious adult thriller that happens to have exhilarating action sequences that importantly dont detract from the emotional content and a plot you will have to sit and think about Its amazing that in a time of remakes and sequels that a director is given carte blanche to do what he wants and returns something as gratifying as this Stunning Why are you still reading this Go Watch Now,Positive
Good cinematics great fps Controls were weird though theres a delay between when I press buttons and when I move Tried to change keybindings but it wasnt in settings It kept crashing and I had to stop playing It has the potential to be a great game if these issues get patched for the official release,Negative
I dont know what the big deal is I saw the movie and I didnt think it was bad at all And you know what I HOPE there will be a sequel Because I LOVE Vegeta And I think that it actually had the potential to be a good movie if people werent ragging on it before they even saw it I mean look at the Death Note and Sailor Moon live actions They were WAAAAAAAY worse than this movie So I think it deserves a LOT more credit than its being gived LOL Obviously it doesnt follow the story line very well but for what it does bring cheesy humor that I think all Dragonball fans can appreciate Call me crazy or stupid all you want But as a diehard DB and DBZ fan I went I saw and I am buying the DVD O,Negative
People are just given it a bad review just to jump on the bandwagon Im a big Marvel fan and I liked the movie I think people are so use to the Jokes after jokes after jokes these new marvelDisney movies they have been producing where every marvel character is funny So when you see a darker toned movie from them thats not family friendly people dont like it I think the pacing was good I was tuned in Its also the fact Hes not a big name like SpidermanThor However for a standalone movie it wasnt bad but because people dont know Morbius I think it would of helped if they had cameos of others like blade etc Or they should of had him introduced into someone elses movie first like how Black Panther was introduced in the avengers movies I think you should see it for yourself everybody has their own taste I like the darker side of Marvel like Blade Spawn Ghost Rider Punisher etc,Notr
The less said about this vile  minute ad the better This manipulative excuse for a movie deserves a  star in the hope that if its universally panned the studios wont be tempted to produce more of this vomitIve noticed several  star reviews for this movie Do not take any notice These people are either trolls or sad obvious shills They say alcohol consumption kills brain cells it has nothing on this garbage,Negative
The movie Morbius is a simple actions adventure and sort of crime film which is about a doctor suffering from a rare blood disease Doctor Morbius is after a cure but in the process he turns himself to a something unexpected and changes his life for goodThe movie is so underrated that I thought I was going to watch a complete garbage However it turned out to be as satisfactory as any other action movies Almost every actors performance was okay I liked it actually However the screenplay could have been deeper The process for the characters to evolve is not enough and it actually needed more time and deeper meaning to it The visual and special effects were satisfactorily interesting however they could explore the abilities of the main character further and deeperGenerally the movie is satisfactorily entertaining if you lower your expectations level and enjoy the movie,Notr
Me and my son Muhammad were shocked how this great and funny D movie whose budget is  million dollars is so underrated and hated The film centers on Gene a multiexpressional emoji who lives in a teenagers phone and who sets out on a journey to become a normal meh emoji like his parentsMy son Muhammad and I laughed and saw this movie too entertaining for kids and adults and the thing that convinces us to see despite the unstoppable attack on it is that it has already reached number  in the US Box Office and that many openminded people did not believe the malicious hatred against a quality movie like this,Negative
The characters are so well developped and well interpreted by the actors that you really feel for them which makes the whole story even more compeling The structure builts up emotionnaly like only Darabont can do it Breathtaking,Positive
I honestly dont understand the hate directed towards this movie Its not going to win an Oscar but who expected that anyway You all know the story from the other reviews I just came here to say if you want an entertaining enough action flick then this is worth watching,Notr
The movie is choking under too much random ideas which dont stand together to make up a solid world and trigger the suspension of disbelief But the one idea closing the movie at the end clicks so well that I immediately thought it shouldve been the first thing to play out in any sequel earlier,Notr
I went in to see Dragonball not expecting much The trailer already told me that the movie was gonna be very Americanized have whack special effects and a white Goku Although it was exactly what I expected the movie was still pretty fun Everything was pretty lame like the acting the jokes and basically all the characters I guess the actor who played Goku got it right with the goofiness but it still felt strange All the actors were okay theyre werent horrible like Street Fighter but not great I felt that the actor that played Bulma the best out of the whole group The actor for Yamcha was misscasted he sucked balls It was weird that Cho YunFat played Master Roshi and an older actor played Grandpa Gohan when Roshi supposedly was Gohans master but whatever Overall the movie is just what youd expect The resolution and plot twist was kinda stupid and was totally different from the Dragonball tv show If the movie was at least  hours long it was only  minutes what a waste the plot couldve been better and stuff,Negative

Ive seen people absolutely trashing this movie and it really isnt bad Some of them seem to have a personal vendetta against Jared Leto and it is clearly influencing their ratings of this movieIf you had fun with The Last Witch Hunter or Gods of Egypt same writers then youll probably have some fun with this movie tooThe story isnt trying to be art its only try to be entertainment And lets face it half of the Marvel movies at least are totally unremarkable and uninspired The only real difference between this movie and those is that Morbius the character doesnt have millions of rabid fans who blindly buy tickets and praise everything with his name on it,Notr
To describe Inception in a single adjective will never be enough The sheer magnitude at which this movie happens is simply exceptional It couldve only been pulled off by someone as good as Chris Nolan I can go on and on about praising this movie was hours thats months in dream level one and years in dream level two Put it simply this is the best movie Ive watched in my life because of its idea its execution and its emotional depth People always moan about Nolans movies not being emotional but this one is definitely not one of them You will feel for Cobb and Mal Di Caprio has done a terrific job showing the vulnerabilities and guilt of Cobb Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt have given neat performances Tom Hardy was simply brilliant in the way he handled Eames Cilian as usual has done job well The rest of the cast have done a good job as well The cinematography by Wally Pfister is one of the best in recent times Hans Zimmers music is haunting Editing by Lee Smith is top notch But this film truly belongs to Nolan From the storyline to its execution Nolan oozes confidence in every department Be it narration bringing awestriking visuals or keeping us on the edge of our seats he has truly demonstrated that hes not only one of the most entertaining but one of the most intelligent directors in world cinema today For that take a bow Nolan,Positive
Was it perfect No Was it as good as the Original No Was it a fun film that you could just sit back and enjoy Yes The tension and thrills as well as a solid conclusion to all the characters new and the old ones that didnt get a decent ending in the original trilogy made it enjoyable enough The dialogue was poor at times there is no denying it but overall solid action and conclusive,Notr

I expected a lot worse than what I saw here and because of that I was able to enjoy a lot of it but nonetheless it is awful The plot is a generic ripoff of a number of animated films and the animation could have been a lot better although it was clear from some scenes that it wasnt the animators but the director who didnt have much idea on what to do There were a lot of moments which could have come out better if someone with a little more creativity worked behind this The worst part is that some kids are gonna like it because they are uninitiated with better films and would grow up thinking this to be a classic with a nostalgia clouding their judgement even when they grow up,Negative
Do you know the video of the beaver screaming If I could put that here trust meI would Ive thought about gouging out my eyeballs with a rusty spoon after watching this May god have mercy on our souls and anyone who found this movie enjoyable I hope this movie doesnt cause the actors and actresses that were worthy of better movies to be damned for eternity for voicing such a horrible movie God help us,Negative
Christopeher Nolan is a talented director With batman beginshe created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game With the dark knight he made not only a great second sequel but also one of the best movies of the past  years He mixed action heroism feeling literature colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends There is no doubt about it But i see some people who dont mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so farHaha this is completely unacceptableLet me clear this If a movie can bring freshness to creativity If a movie happens to change your insights If a movie starts a new genre gives away new techniques and styles If a movie makes you understand your heart better then I call that movie a masterpiece As far as I see The Dark Knight is far from it But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film Thanks,Positive
I am convinced that this movies rating is being hatebombed by trolls Whether its because people despise Sony or hate Jared Leto I dont know What I do know is that this flick was a fun compelling superhero origin story that kept me entertainedSure it wasnt groundbreaking It wasnt crammed with shareduniverse tieins And it certainly wasnt a masterpiece But the acting was great the CGI was dazzling and the atmosphere was chilling in the best wayJared Leto was a great fit for this role and the character was fleshed out well even if the supporting characters were a bit lacking in this departmentBottom line dont let the bad reviews fool you My husband and I enjoyed this movie and give it a thumbs up,Notr
"This is this kind of movie that you think you would love it but when you watch it you realize that its total disaster This movie doesnt have any story I expected that this movie will show that having friends and connecting with people in the real world it is more important than texting emojis on your telephone
In my opinion this is the worst movie I ever saw",Negative
I am writing this while watching the film I am bored The story they are trying to tell is not needed and over explained The lack of Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishbourne also detractsJada pinkett Smith was bad enough in the last film but her acting under all the make up in this is laughableThe film was not needed at all and the story should of been left alone and finished in  where it endedThe visuals are good but not enough to save this poorly executed sequel,Notr
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies I have ever seen The movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King Unlike most of his novels King didnt write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places Overseeing the transition from book to big screen is Frank Darabont who in his director debut scores a home run with this movieNot only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a fantastic job as the  central characters and as friends Bob Gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden The directing cast and plot all combine to make the movie awesomeThe plot of the movie revolves around Andy Dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit Over time Andy becomes friends with Red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison The story then follows the  and how they handle prison lifeYears go by but Andy continues to speak of hope Ultimately Andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational The message the story delivers is to never give up hoping The climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film historyOverall the Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time,Positive
I saw this movie is weste totally waste of time my verdict is dont watch the movie because its totally lag and its a normal Hollywood movies and there is no high graphics weast movie As we all know science fiction when it is done well reflects social and political tensions back to the culture in disguised forms so that we take them in and metabolize them without really knowing what it is that we are consuming In Jurassic World we are transported into the perilous mindscape of radical feminism where in accordance with the tradition and finally i says about the movie is totally boring,Notr
How bad could this movie be was my feeling before watching this And to be honest pretty bad Main idea of the movie seems to be hand jokes name dropping different apps and references to basically any entertainment related things Towards the end I was just trying to find all these references Its like the movie tried to take the plot from wreckit Ralph and Inside out but fails miserably Mix in some forced gender equality and you end up with a pretty bad movie Best parts were cat video poop emoji and few actually funny hand jokes But too much is too much I did watch the whole movie so it wasnt all bad Maybe if it wasnt just about the puns the movie couldve had its moments Now there really werent,Negative
Not sure why there are so many haters for this film Its great And its funny I love watching it especially with my kids Great message,Negative
I finally understand the hate this got Theres no story literally just singing throughout of which didnt look good even had mistakes in multiple scenes I hate musicals like this especially where its just singing and barely any regular dialogue Im pretty sure the bulk was bad CGI too,Negative
Look I know the plot of this movie is all over the place but tbh I really liked and enjoyed it Jurassic Park was my childhood Ive watched it so many times and seeing the OG Cast finally back on the big screen made me soo happy Also Im a huge DinoNerd so Im maybe a little bit biasedI really liked that some lesser known or non mainstream dinos got the spotlight The chemistry between the old and new cast worked great There are many shotsscenes which are really cinematic and look absolutely gorgeousOverall storyplot is okay but messy great cast and chemistry cool dinosaurs that usually dont get enough spotlight some really cool looking scenes which I would love to have as a wallpaper and lots of fanservice and callbacks to the old movies,Notr
I mean theatre is performed live for a reason Watching a two hour long theatre bit from a screen is deadly boring The lack of adaptation to film format is unbelievable Not to mention the hilariously bad CGI leaving these characters looking like Thomas the tank engine But there is something wonderful about seeing bunch of Hollywood a listers floating heads in this atrocity Like how did such a massive budget movie go SO wrong Hilarious,Negative
Why are they allowee to make money and films like this That was so awful beyond comprehension The cast was terrible and especially that silly late night host He needs help,Negative
Its time to end the Jurassic franchise This movie is just more of the same They added giant locust in this one so theres that But really there was no reason to make this film Its the same dinosaurs The same dinosaur sounds The same running jumping climbing swimming and hiding from dinosaurs The same dramatic drawn out camera angles on the actors faces as they look either scared concerned or allknowing before scrambling to safety just in the nick of time There was no real suspense because we knew our main characters would make it home safely If the creators are insistent on making ANOTHER Jurassic film please update the formula,Notr
I dont understand why people even hate this movie The idea is original it shows what our apps REALLY look like and its very funny while also relatable If you hate this movie you must be hating on smartphones too Or to classifyYou Are A BOOMER,Negative
This movie will forever be my all time favorite Not only was I living in Pittsburgh when it was being filmed but it was also released on my birthday Best movie ever,Positive
I hate this so much and has thankfully stayed away from it so I havent watch it in other words  It ripoffs two excellent movies inside out and wreckitRalph for some bad advertisement And they also wanted to cancel a movie that looked good for this garbage But I give it a  out of  because its bad but not as bad as Foodfight,Negative
Dragonball Evolution  Am I horrified when it comes to this film I think not But what I am horrified about are all of the socalled Dragonball fans who are talking like idiots about a film that is exceptionally great Do you know how stupid you sound when you post something like Bulma would have been better if her hair were blue or Justin Chatwin is going to suck as Goku because he doesnt look like himYeah okay  He doesnt look like an animated character Dont be stupid You all are finding the dumbest reasons to hate this title Its either because   This movie didnt follow closely to the original storyline  Characters didnt look EXACTLY LIKE the originals  Some scene had bad special effects You have to give an amount of Leeway for this film  as like other films none are perfectI find the actors performances were at their best and the action scenes were awesome I and other Dragonball fans enjoyed the efforts of the films creatorsstaff Yeah the movie had its faults  but for the most part this flic is a blast,Negative
I consider this movie as one of the most fantastic and joyful movie to watch It touch a social problem that few movie directors and producers took the risk of doing like the institutionalized thing All of the stories developed in this movie even if they are all related of the main character every own little story is very interesting and full of emotions This movie contains good drama a different comedy insight I think I have seen this movie at least  times and I just dont get tire of watch in it i think every time i watch it i found new thingsI highly recommend to spend time enjoying this amazing movie and just a piece of advice is take the time to read a little bit the reviw and find no one bad,Positive
"Let me review this film on two aspects its merit and its high placement
First of all ask yourself this question Is a film great simply because it achieves I hope many think this is not the case Shawshank has a slow and methodical pace Along with good performances around the board The simple staging and lighting of the film is overdone in its simplicity and I personally see no art in it at all But Im not saying its a bad film Its not and its far from it But to be ranked over vastly more intelligent efforts is a sad reflection on our society
The writing is topnotch The best thing about the film is the flow of the story and I could have simply read a book I am no huge fan of visual effects or quick paced storytelling  but I am a fan of art Reading a book would be as enthralling as watching this film Seeing the acting is like watching lines being delivered but being delivered wellAs for its rating on the site  the film pushes no boundaries in which film often offends people to the point of disliking it It has a nice uplifting story at the end and presses a lot of hot buttons Including murder infidelity and scandal Searching for the soundtrack for this film is what brought me to IMDb for the first time actually So I dare not say this is a bad film I only say its ranked higher than vastly superior filmsRating C",Positive
Hilariously bad laughed so much  on the hilariocity scale  if you are a fan of the show i dont even know why theyd base it on the show if they were just going to change EVERYTHING  viewings,Negative
NO NO NO NO NO Unbelievable How could anyone think this was a good idea I dont even want to go into the plot So Im just going to try and get off this crappy film and try and review it as fast as possible for people thinking of watching thisThe acting is god awful Wrong casting everywhere Bulma doesnt have blue hair and acts NOTHING like she did in the original Nobody is right in this atrocity A fact The director didnt watch dragon ball z at all Its always a good idea to give a director who doesnt know anything about the franchise to direct the film Bloody brilliant The effects Oh those low budget effects Two words Hand Fart Kamehameha looks like a freaking blue air pulse thing and nothing about the moves had their explosive effect as they did in the original The cgi sweat is plain embarrassing and Im sure I could do better by inserting spheres in blender and covering them with stock footage texturesIm not sure what they were thinking but for the love of god DO NOT MAKE A ANIME A LIVE ACTION FILM,Negative
The film was very disappointing Firstly Heath Ledger wow didnt see that coming He was terrific From A knights tale to the dark knight not the same actor surely The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed I am going to compare this to the  film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make The  film was entertaining this wasnt It was too dark too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isnt the aim of comics Christian Bales voice as Batman was ridiculous I didnt have any empathy with his character at all didnt feel for him just nothing Thought that I wouldnt want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia Though I appreciate the lack of CGI very refreshing and the last half an hour of the film i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained This was just depressing Cant understand why this is considered to be the third best film of all time on IMDb astounding,Positive
Seriously this movie is one of my favourite movie of all time go watch it,Negative
This was the best movie I have ever seen The jokes are funny especially the poop jokes which is fun for the whole familyI forced my friends to watch this masterpiece with low expectations and oh how was I wrong After the movie I sent my friends to the gulag where they could work and watch the emoji movie for the rest of their pitiful lives I rate this movie a ten for its unpredictable funny witty modern humour I cant recommend this movie enough as Im sitting at my desk cutting my wristsAnd remember horizontal for attention vertical for results,Negative
This is the worst ever rated movie I ever took to the time to watch and im glad I didThis movie is not bad and it has the classic story line of the hero going on a journey to discover his true worth It does not deserve the  rating The animation is great and all in all it is a well produced movie This movie brings nothing new to the table but if you are looking for a movie to watch with the kids on a Saturday night this is gonna be just fineThe poor rating is simply people getting too personally invested in the idea of using emojis as a universe,Negative
Watched this with our  and  year old They loved it and we did toosuper surprised it was rated an average of  on here ,Negative
Not sure why this has such a low score Its full of action dinosaurs and nostalgic cheese Just sit back and enjoy IMDB is going to get ruined by ridiculous scores There is no way this deserves so many low ratings If you dont like it fine Lets add some s for production acting sound effects and entertainment value,Notr

This movie does DBZ series no justice First off you know how they cast a white guy in an obvious Asian role Sure he is an alien you say but thats no excuse He also has super powers to blow up an entire planet what im trying to say is that Goku has black hair eats Asian food is married to an Asian woman lives in an Asian country so on and so forth Let racist Hollywood put a white dude with his Asian wife Im boycotting this movie and have advised all my friends not to watch it Let them lose their money on this flick If you want to watch this crap do it for free using bit torrent or something,Negative
Not at all as bad as the critics said Sure its not like watching the musical but the singing and dancing is very good The characters are a bit one dimensional but they are from a book of poems for goodness sake Judy dench has her lovely screen presence in it Its a perfectly watchable translation from the film given a bit more explanation than the stage play I prefer the mungo Jerry number in this to the musical In short Watch with an open mind and not based on what the critics say,Negative

WHY WHY WHY do Hollywood keep turning everything into a Feminist project  They Bomb one after the other and they dont seem to learn the lesson that no one goes to watch a movie to see forced lines about woman oppression and womans rights or woman can do it better Just give us a good story and good actors stop turning everything into a political drama This is a Feminist version of Matrix if thats your thing then this is for you if not then skip it and save your money,Notr
This may seem like faint praise but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didnt even realize it was a superhero movie,Positive
This is a classic superhero movie It really gets to the audience and I give a it a solid rating as to it had a great story development and background into the characters  it wasnt flashy like many people expect it was quite to the point and with great scenes and good cinematography and VFX I agree as its in a dark setting couldnt have been many peoples favorite but I promise its better that just the flashy superhero I hope they use Jared Leto in Marvel ahead Hes a really good actor,Notr
Blah blah blah  how much talking and exposition is in this movie The original matrix had a lot of talking too but every conversation is intriguing In this movie it bored me to death Almost put me to sleepBlah blah blah  the mess of a story that is this movie Its all over the place and feels like a bunch of nonsense mashed togetherBlah blah blah  the unclear and uninspiring action The fight scenes in the first two movie are amongst the best ever put to screen including Asian cinema The action in Reloaded is incredible In this movie it just feels like action vomit all over the screen It ranges from mediocre to bad And only one part is memorable certain things are falling onto the street The fight scenes suffer from close ups and quick cuts something we never see in the originalsThe more I think about it a  star rating seems generous But thats how I felt leaving the theater There is some good here But I dont think Id bother giving it another chance  viewing ,Notr
Absolutely no one asked for the movie version of The Uncanny Valley,Negative
Im seriously considering putting my cat up for adoption after having seen this film because I can now never look at a cat the same way again I I Im just horrified,Negative
in my opinion its better than the ordinary Monte Cristo story that we all know as the greatest escape tale  so this time the escape is greater and the hero is an ordinary man  who is so patient and hopeful while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may think that its social or silly story but minute by minute you will recognize that you were wrong its a Brilliant Storya never seen before  a very powerful drama  the best thing in that movie was the relations between characterslike hatingand true friendship like the one which was between Tim Robins and Morgan FreemanI like this movie and i advice every one on the planet to watch it as soon as possible,Positive
Great Movie The most amazing Batman film ever After seeing this movie I was left speechlessThe performances from every actor and actress was amazing Just an excellent film a must movie to see It has ACTION It has LAUGHS It has HUMOR It has non stop ONE LINERS from the jokerIf any movie has deserved a perfect  this would be it Excellent work Thanks for thatThe most amazing Batman film ever After seeing this movie I was left speechlessThe performances from every actor and actress was amazing,Positive
Why are people going mental over this MatrixPaprika wannabe Its undeservingly credited for way to many things Maybe Im being too harsh since its the best blockbuster in the last two years but lets be honest The first half of the movie is drowning in clichs and the rule show dont tell is not being utilized at all Am I the only one who finds those tedious dialogues when they explain the whole plot as if we were ten year olds  really annoying The real people in those situations would talk and react completely differently That makes the character interactions and conversations barely believable and just emptyAlso actors who play Saito and Mal are really destroying any credibility of the drama and tension movie has Saito besides being a Morpheus wannabe always talks as if he was simply happy he remembered the lines And why oh why do they have such unnatural bad and forced accents Ellen Page was a bad choice too another clich  younger student learns everything sensei has to say in  min and then teaches HIM a lesson DiCaprio wasted his talent here his powerful acting was ruined by the forced tension of the movie and a lousy soundtrack which apparently never stopsThe second half of the movie was better and combined with the end gave a certain satisfaction in terms of mental food Nolan really is a master of plot and king of moments  unfortunately this is obviously becoming his biggest weakness The overall impression is it could have been a LOT better Its not awful but giving it a  and calling it a benchmark is just ridiculous,Positive

Ive been searching around for the movie greats on this website and searched for some of the classics like the Godfather the Shawshank Redemption Shindlers List and Freddy Got Fingered and I came across this beautiful visually stunning masterpiece assuming it will at least get an  and I was appalled to see such a low score on such a masterpiece These primitive neanderthals think they have a sense of art The morals and themes fly straight through there heads while they are scratching their aes for an hour and thirty minutes Marlon Brando would be rolling in his grave to see such an artistic beauty rated a  I thought of Al Pacino who did many classics like Jack and Jill when I saw TJ Millers performance of Gene Screw It I thought of Gene Wilder Just while I thought I was restoring my faith in humanityCheers Bob Marley Writer Actor Director Producer,Negative
I had very low expectations about this movie due to its extremely low rating but its actually not so bad Ive seen a lot of worse animated pictures and Im clueless about why the rating is so low Im also unsure however why there are so many user reviews rating it  Its an average childrens animated movie which adults can also vaguely enjoy,Negative
In the ongoing war against human intelligence this film qualifies as a war crime The filmmakers and actors are war criminals They go on trial at the Hague And then grow old in a Jellical prison Thankfully they only have ONE life,Negative
Like most the original Matrix blew my mind when I saw it in the theaters I dont think there will ever be another movie that will have the same effect on me and truly being genre defining So its silly to expect it from Matrix Resurrections They were never shy acknowledging this was in big part fan service and honestly they did well on that end They also managed to make a decent story have good action scenes and get the actors to give it their best shot Again it doesnt compare to the original but its good enough to make you forget Reloaded and Revolutions and just for that its a great movie in my book,Notr
Would have been a good movie if the director and writers were fired and it was allowed to be rated R And they wonder why people dont want to go to the theaters to watch a poorly made movie for  This movie would have been nothing without Matt Smith and Jared Leto to hold up the story line The inconsistencies and poor writing permeate the story extremely well Its a shame the character and plot development werent given the same care Im pretty sure there were additional scenes but just didnt make the cut for whatever reason One of the best parts of the movie was after the credits rolled,Notr
It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison but The Shawshank Redemption creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family I wont spend much word on this movie to justify how classic movie is this Worth a watch many times,Positive

I always really enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption and my appreciation remains consistent with repeated viewings With a  IMDB rating decades after its release shows that this is a movie that speaks to people and I have not met anyone who doesnt like this movie Among Steven King adaptations this is probably the best I like Stanley Kubricks The Shining just as much for different reasons But dont tell Steven King that lol The Shawshank Redemption is much more than a prison movie its an absolutely engrossing movie that has audiences glued to the screen from start to finish Director Frank Darabond did a fantastic job putting this together with top notch cinematography direction and a great attention to detail Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give unforgettable performances The Shawshank Redemption is flawless filmmaking and storytelling that has few films that are its equal All and all The Shawshank Redemption is perfect in my book and is recommended to anybody who wants to see a great movie,Positive
There was no plot character development was nonexistent Product placement was everywhere The romance was also so amazingly disappointing and probably shouldnt have even been in the movie I doubt I will ever have children knowing that they will grow up in a world where this is seen as actual entertainment and not a pile of poop emoji This isnt a  million dollar movie and looked like it had the budget of your average Bollywood film I doubt Ill ever see an emoji the same way as this mentally and emotionally scarred me to the point that I feel emotions have become obsolete Overall the movie was an utter waste of money I give it  OK hand emojis out of ,Negative

You know a movies horrible if viewing it makes you reevaluate your life I was tempted to run a psychological evaluation immediately after deciding to watch Normally when you take a bathroom break you would want to go back as soon as possible This was NOT the case In fact youd gladly take as much time as possible away from the theater just to escape the soulcrushing horror that is the Emoji MovieThe audio and visuals that this film emits radiates worse than than that of the  Chernobyl Disaster Longlasting side effects include mental breakdowns night terrors and clinical depression Overall this movie is not for the faint of heart Watch with caution,Negative

Jurassic World Dominion is an entertaining movie whose script is full of fanservice especially for those like me who loved the first movie its quite nice to see Sam Neill Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum together again In terms of logic the script has many flaws that are justified by the science fiction theme that the film touches on The soundtrack is good especially the theme used in suspenseful scenes The cinematography is powerful and provides some great visuals The performances are good and the director does a good job An entertaining movie but with nothing more to offer,Notr
This is one of those films that come once in a blue moon The ones that leave you sitting on your seat staring at the screen when the film is ended and trying to think of a word to describe the excellence of the film Although Shawshank does take a while to get started but you understand why later on the film The characters need to be explained for you to understand later points in the film What really makes this film great is the use of no special effects no stunts just plain simple amazingly originalwitty story writing and outstanding acting by every character in the film including the minor ones Just based in a prison men talking to each other This film does make you feel involved in the film You feel every characters emotions and pain and share their joy and happiness When the film ends it takes you  seconds to get back to reality again  its just that compellingBest personal Film of all time and best film on IMDb and rightly so Spectacular Film ,Positive
Bad acting or directing Maybe too small a sound stage with too much green screen Everybody always seemed to be standing so close to each other I dunno it felt lowbudget and maybe even lazy because they didnt seem to be trying to being anything new to the table Just resting on their laurels to bring in the viewsAnyway I didnt feel the nostalgia for the first movie like I think I was supposed to I used the fastforward button a lot  which I never do the first time I watch a film  and I just couldnt find myself in it like I did in most of the othersIts too bad too because I would really have liked to feel that nostalgia and I really wanted to suspend my disbeliefThis is a rare review from me Im actually sorry that I felt I needed to write it,Notr
The entire plot of the movie just feels generic and lacking in any depth which make the entire thing feel unnecessary It feels like as though they made a story just to bring back Neo and trinity and the world for a few quick bucks The entire first act is just so drowned in nostalgia and self referential nods that I just found it hard to enjoy the movie Its not until maybe the last act where things feel somewhat original and by then I couldnt find any connection to the characters or why these events are even happening to begin with Its convoluted messy and generic all at the same time Not necessary viewing for Matrix fans,Notr
This is the  Absolute must see film of the s Our Generation anyones lifetime and quite possibly the history of film Hope and perseverance are front and center as themes in this blockbuster Anyone of any age any race either sex and any religion should see this and I promise youll wish to share it with everyone you know Dont think another Prison Movie aboutthis one its above and beyond that clich Expect career performances from Morgan Freeman Tim Robbins Bob Gunton and James Whitmore Along side many outstanding character performances from the supporting cast I Cannot emphasizethe importance of this film I personally thank Everyone involved in producing such an enormous telling of Steven Kings masterpiece It has become a source of daily inspiration for me and I continue to watch it Several times a year to this day thank you,Positive

Love the content and the graphics of the movie this one has a whole different experience compared to the other Jurassic World moviesmovie was so utterly predictable it was a little painful Luckily the nostalgia nods were sprinkled throughout and mostly not forced You can tell they tried to have some funny oneliners which fell flat a lot of the time They need to take some notes from Marvel on those The CGI and action was as good as youd expect and offered favorable intensity The story itself was somewhat lazy IMO Did I mention it was totally predictable,Notr
Jared Letto has failed me again with his attempts in playing anti heroes like Joker and Morbius Well to be fair this time it isnt his fault This movie lacked in storyline character development and formidable villain I can tell who the villain was gonna be just few minutes into the movie The final fight was underwhelming and just a lazy setup for sequel,Notr
I wasnt expecting much I have never seen the musical I have heard the song Memories but thats it All of that said I thoroughly enjoyed this movie Jennifer Hudson was incredible The other stars were almost as memorizing for me  although keep in mind I am someone who used to dance and could watch hours of ballet without boredom Well done,Negative
This is the best movie I have ever seen In a way I feel I am in a prison of life myself Restricted to doing certain things Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free I hope and dream for it sometime This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie Although critics say Tim Robbins didnt do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this roleI can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I feel whenever I watch itI am glad to visit IMDb I never heard of it before Some  years ago I saw it at no in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane But that is about past and this one is about hope and freedomI give it ,Positive
Heath ledgers character the joker is phenomenal One of the best acting performances ever The dark night is a great movie but not the best Not in the top  Its Avery good movie with a thrilling story but it is a bit overrated This movie never really gets old And the story of heath ledger and the joker role pushing his mental state further Heath ledger unfortunately killed himself after the role Dont get me wrong the dark knight is a great excellent movie but it shouldnt be the top  of the world even nearly the top  But the dark knight is the best sequel for a Christopher Nolan movie ever Thank you Christopher Nolan for making the greatest superhero movie of all time,Positive
I am one of those who grew up in the matrix generation I have watched the original films countless times as well as the animatrix and I rewatched everything in anticipation for this newest instalmentI had my doubts when I first heard they were making another Matrix and was intrigued as to how Neo and Trinity would return After watching this newest instalment I dont understand the widespread negativity towards the film It is done in a unique way which is not cheesy or expected and the plot is different enough from the original films that it feels fresh while still keeping the aesthetics that the fans loveMy only issues with the film was that it had way too many flashback scenes of the previous film and the beginning set up took up most of the movie and then the end felt rushed Overall though I think if you were a fan of the original films you will enjoy this for what it is,Notr
My     year olds love this movie and ask to watch it everyday My husband and I really enjoyed it too It doesnt have a lot of music but definitely keeps the kids attention The movie reminded my husband and I of Reck it Ralph I cant understand why this movie was reviewed so poorly,Negative
To be brief as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen The plot the way it develops the acting the portrayal of every human emotion and the ending makes  of movies seem like just a waste of time I didnt see it until a few years after it came out My sister said it was a great movie It was on HBO so I watched it I was speechless I have always found it strange that it was from a Steven King novel Ive read a few not that one and what comes through in the movie doesnt seem like anything that would be in a Steven King novel A better movie may come along but it may be a while,Positive

Run Tim Robbinss name in the database and I dont think youll find that hes starred in too many movies worth watching  Generally most movies hes in have the subtlety of a ball peen hammer across your forehead  This movie atones for a thousand sins  Carefully written deliberately paced lovingly acted this film brings you in and leads you to the light on the other side Nothing is forced but not a single plot thread is left dangling Hollywood needs a lot more movies like this one  See it twice,Positive

This is the first time watching anything Dragon Ball Z I enjoyed the acting and script as it seemed to be alike to comics or Anime scenes The writing was fun as there were a lot of times that it felt like anime but with real actors and actresses I dont agree with the low rating since this movie was entertaining and thats what movies should be If you were not entertained by this movie then it must take a lot more to entertain you I thought there was comical scenes loving scenes and really cool action scenes The film was believable to me and I enjoyed diving in the entertainment,Negative
This movie is an insult to its viewers Last time I felt like this was after watching transformers  It is just a giant mess The story is convoluted and has no meaning The supposedly scary encounters with the carnivores do not produce any atmospheric impact Woke messaging of course included as well This movie shall be remembered as part of the prime degeneracy of hollywood,Notr
"I love animated movies but this is just a complete disaster Dont see this movie ever in your life I watched this movie a while back and I hated every single thing about this movie First the jokes arent that funny Second most of the characters were really annoying and bland This is a complete ripoff of the LEGO Movie
The worst movie by Sony so far",Negative
If you own a cat live near a cat or ever again intend on being in close proximity of a cat do not watch this move The irresistible urge to kick every cat you see is a real side effect of being exposed to this rubbishPlease desex your cats your fat English talk show hosts and your self important pop stars,Negative
Look this movie like every blockbuster has its flaws but its expected with these films Im a Jurassic Park fan and youll never beat the OG but this movie is very entertaining and fast paced probably too fast paced for some and maybe thats one of its flaws or pros depending how you look at it Hopefully the extended version when it releases helps with thatBut overall this movie is awesome even after seeing it twice ,Notr
Morbius is a clear example of what a bad movie is The script is pretty bad full of narrative plots The acting is pretty bad the direction seems nonexistent and worst of all are the special effects The only redeeming thing about this movie is the cinematography which is decent,Notr
It is not uncommon to hire people to write reviews on social networks that should appear to be by independent contributors Thats why i had to laugh when i saw The Shawshank Redemption being the best rated movie on IMDb But since there would be little sense in making such an effort to generate more than a million votes and almost three thousand reviews for a movie made in  i assume this is genuineIn any case based on Stephen Kings novella The Shawshank Redemption was an alright prison movie to watch However it displays what i see as typical for Kings work When hes writing science fiction fantasy or horror it all sits well But when he writes anything that should mirror reality it simply feels fake in the same way as wearing a cotton shirt and the one made of synthetics feels different The events might have been based on actual events but i havent been convincedObviously when you make any kind of list there will always be a first place On IMDb it is currently being taken by The Shawshank Redemption,Positive
One of the best movies ever made Simple as that Top  ever and top  of the s The ending is just so powerful,Positive
I personally think that the way this movie touches me cannot be put into words The core of this movie is hope hope that overcomes every obstacle placed in your way the knowing that the wronged people in life can triumph over evil This is what Andy Dufresne achieves and the tag line of Fear can hold you prisoner hope can set you free is perfect The underlying theme is friendship and Andy and Reds friendship is perfectly portrayed here by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins They are both fine actors and I feel here they give career best performancesalthough Morgan Freeman is generally good in everything Morgan Freeman should of won an Oscar for his subtle approach to this role  surely his million dollar baby Oscar is a belated one for this movie too The directing the story and everything combine to make this a special movie  dont worry the ratings in the all time list which always put this movie in the top  are not wrong This is a movie everyone must see,Positive
Dont Even Bother Watching This Garbage Watch Chicken Run Or Jimmy Neutron,Negative
Well maybe this isnt the best animation I have seen but it has some great moments and the good thing with kids is that they typically transfers their enthusiasm to their surroundings and that makes the experience better Location seating  time Palads Kbenhavn Denmark  Bio  row  seat       at ,Negative
I too was dazzled by this movie when I first saw it Robbins and Freeman were both fabulous and the story was an intensely happy marriage of the nostalgic and edifying to the tense and disturbing The theme of success against the odds is rarely so emotive and the desperate hope and yearning are truly palpableBut its simply NOT the best film of all time Parts of it are cliched most of it is downright implausible The symbolism is trite and way too inyourface particularly with Freeman explicitly spelling out albeit touchingly what should have been the movies duty to portrayThe ending was a shameless exercise in trying to make the world feel better than its ever felt before Films have every right to be manipulative but when its this blatant the magic collapses Or did for me anywayMind you still a smashing flick Im only nitpicking because everybody else seems to be in such a weird frenzy of Shawshank worship,Positive
As I was saying just amazing it makes you laugh cry and even shout,Positive
Dont waste your time SeriouslyI wouldnt even bother to call this an adaptation Its more like a badly written fanfic you know one of those really bad DB characters in high school onesIt was very fast paced and rushed and I pretty promptly forgot most of the movie as soon as I was finished watching it which I can only sum up as good fortuneI wont try and echo what hundreds of way more indepth reviews written here before me have already said Ill cut right to the chase Dont waste perfectly good money on this piece of trash Its not even one of those bad movies thats good for a laugh Youll probably just wind up confused and if youre a fan of the anime probably more infuriated than anythingBut hey At least Piccolo was green,Negative

This movie is a beauty It has stayed permanently in my top  movies of all time since it was released Ive rewatched it countless times The acting storyline and visuals are A,Positive
I had heard about the movie since it first came out but somehow I never got around to watching it Now I superglad that I watched it It is an utterly fantastic movie to the max The movie contains almost every human emotion that there is and overall it is a totally wonderful character study as well There is marvelous writing and a totally well thoughtout plot and the acting talent throughout is on an almost otherworldly level It is a movie that captured my attention from the very beginning keeping me totally engaged throughout for the entire duration of the film All said this is yet another movie that I truly wish that I could give more than ten stars because it truly deserves many many stars,Positive
This film is basically averageNONE of the performances in this film are anything worth getting over exited about Heath Ledgers performance was good It wasnt amazing it wasnt even great Just like Ian Curtis his death did him the world of good Im not saying he wasnt a capable actor Im simply saying he wasnt anything specialHave we reached an age where licking your lips and snuffling is regarded as a performance that should earn him every award known to manHe is only regarded as being so super good because hes dead  simple as thatWatch Tim Burtons Batman its a better film,Positive
I am a DB fan and this my friends was not what I expected I wont even comment on the movie that is how sorry it was Instead I will give you guys on what I thought the movie should have beenIt should have started with an Old Man voice explaining the origin of gokuThey should have show the him coming to earth as a baby with the tail Gohan raising him and training himThey should have had a I dont know a  year old actor to play goku for about an hour into the film they should have had krillin man I will stop here because there are so many should haves that I bet any of us True DB Fans could have directed this film way better then it was I just cant believe they messed this up so much what where these people thinking,Negative
Though this was a very good on your toes dont blink kind of movie In the end I had to ask myself Was it all a dream Acting superb and directing on point Very good movie,Positive
I found that this movie worked surprisingly well as a form of discipline Prior to July th  when my children did something bad I would punish them by taking away their devices or dessert you know the norm Unfortunately this method never deemed sufficient as they would still repeat their actions However when my youngest Timmy called my oldest Todd a stinky pile of bologna I knew what I had to do I marched little Timmy to the car drove to the nearest cinema and purchased two tickets to The Emoji Movie Rest assured he will never call Todd anything ever again Or sleep at night But you know you have to take the bad with the good,Negative
I first saw this film like many others by chance and on DVD And like others I have since watched it over and over again When I feel sad it makes me feel happy when I need hope it gives me hopeWhen I want to reaffirm my very belief in life and all it can offer this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doingIt soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself The portrayal of friendship the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls Thank you Mr Darabont Mr Robins and Mr Freeman Thank you to every one else involved You changed my life,Positive
Despite the fact I often had little to no idea what was going on with this film I loved itTheres just something about The Matrix the whole world and universe that is so incredibly creative thought provoking and awe inspiring and I felt all of that returning to this fourth instalmentWhat I loved about the original films yes all of them was the deep science fiction mixed with a compelling love story political and social commentary and incredible action sequencesDid we get all of that with this film To an extentThe action sequences pale in comparison to the highs of the earlier films although there are some very cool moments The story is also perhaps a little looser but the rest is all thereI loved all of the meta references and on the whole I thought the plot was solid really doubling down on the love story to great effectTheres a lot unwarranted hate out there for this film and Im not sure why In truth it is probably the weakest of the franchise but is still very solid and it gives us a chance to return to the glorious world of the Matrix which I am all for,Notr
Everyone is blind to the true meaning of the Emoji movie The Emoji movie is a piece of artwork that allows the odd people of our society to feel involved How does it make them feel involved because the movie was made by a room full of autistic children who screech and claw at each other Watch the movie and respect the art of the unfortunate,Negative
We heard how bad this movie was online but my  year old son was chomping at the bit to see this We finally saw it when it came to Netflix This was a very cute movie Wasnt completely sure what it was about going in but this a much more enjoyable movie than what I was lead to believe Yeah the plots is a bit predictable and borrows heavily from other kids CGI movies like Wreck it Ralph and other kids fare It has its moments and had me chuckling from time to time with its somewhat dry humor which is my kind of humor All the product placement didnt bother me which is what I think a lot of people really dont like but Im fine with it since it tends to bring us closer with the real world Its not a great movie but its cute family movie overall Even my teen daughter even got into it after hearing how bad it was and liked it Never judge a movie by its  star reviews,Negative
I knew all along that this movie was vaguely based on the actual story of Dragonball The reason why I went to go see it was to laugh at it The feeling I had going in was Oh man They made a movie out of an anime with flying people who shoots beams and fight really really fast I must see it just to laugh at its cheesiness yet It was hard to even laugh at it cause it was just generally bad There are a few quotes and some visual effects that I found really funny but they lasted only a few seconds and that is all It was just so bad that it was hard to make fun of it or laugh at any of its parts If anyone wants to watch it rent it it is not worth the price of watching it in theaters What am I talking about just dont watch it Seriously if someone watches this in the theaters its equivalent to giving a homeless person some money and watching himher go buy alcohol,Negative
Bad script bad acting stupid story a new dinosaur every  minutes too long no suspense Chris Pratt doing the hand thing  million dollar budget for this so many pointless dinosaur fights AND you took  and a half hours to tell me this garbage storyFrankly embarrassing to everyone involved,Notr
I went in as a fan of The Matrix with low expectations I was intrigued from the start It only got more interesting from there Its been days since Ive seen it and Im still thinking about it Thats so rare I thought they handled the story brilliantly I enjoyed it more than the original equals There was just a little heart in this movie which I likedI liked how they handled Morpheus and Agent Smith I liked the new architect character What could I have lived without The big fight scene was meh I didnt care for the cutesy machine ally but thats being nitpicky All on all I would recommend the movie,Notr
Occasionally you go into a cinema and all the films you wanted to see were full As youve come this far and youre a bit of a film fan you go to see a film youve heard nothing about I did this  years ago with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match I sat and waited to be disappointed  hours later I walked out of the cinema a different person before I had not been moved by a film I didnt care if  Indiana Jones made it Sonny Corleone got wacked Fred married Ginger ET got home Before films were either plot driven or character driven they were action or comedy sad or happy a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed respected  or challenged how I viewed an issue or a personShawshank was different there were characters I believed not just one or two but virtually all Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full range of emotions were explored the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of  people Red and Andy I have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hopeThis has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies I am pleased that I am not alone in feeling this way I am glad that it did not win oscars as I feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award ceremony I relish telling everyone this is my favourite film I have seen it many times and will see it many more,Positive
I personally feel that the Dark Knight is a overrated film It is not one of the top  or top  movies every madeIt is a good movie that I recommend seeing and it is by far the best super hero movie to be released But to call it one of the best and put it along side with movies such as Schindlers List and the Godfather is giving it to much praise I know I am going to get a huge negative response for this comment due to the fact that everyone loves this movie so much but I personally dont think it is a flawless movie like everyone makes it out to be It is good the acting is good the special effects are goodbut the hype for this movie didnt reach a crazy level till Heath Ledger passed then right before release everyone started throwing a fit over this movie Give it a watch and treat it as it deserves to be,Positive
This movie has a great plot some minor flaws here and there but not enough to affect the score The characters are really interesting and you witness them growing throughout the whole movie All the jokes were incredibly edgy and sharp truly the pinnacle of comedy I never thought such perfect movie could even exist  would watch again,Negative
This movie is a work of art The finest sequel ever made I dont think we will see another movie like this for a long time Heath Ledgers Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far Avengers Endgame is great but The Dark Knight is much better The best Batman ever The best Joker ever The best DC movie ever The best superhero movie ever Ando for me the best movie ever,Positive
Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth Its absolutely impossible to explain the incredible that Inception has Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting edge of seat mind blower and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there Congratulations to the well deserved best director writer and producer of films in my opinion Also the acting is fabulous everyone did an amazing job and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept Also the CGI and effects are amazing Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie,Positive
TLDR Save yourself the trouble and time and watch something anything elseAnyone who can make vampires this boring and uninteresting should never be allowed to make another movie ever againI was so bored with this half way thru the movie that I didnt even bother pausing any more when I needed a drink or bathroom break A total yawn fest with nothing even remotely worth praisingI have watched many vampire movies from all decades and I cannot recall one of them that made me want to stop watching as much as this one Even the story was boring I simply cannot think of one good thing at all to say about this movie,Notr
This was just too overstuffed underwhelming and exhausting to have to sit through a  min runtime story that couldve easily been told in  minutes It was too much filler and not enough substance in between the UFC dino bouts that it felt we were watching a fivehour movie marathon Even the performances and actors expressions when they were face to face with the dinos felt more like a Disney Jurassic Park themed ride promo commercial,Notr
I had no idea what was going on the whole time The story line made no sense and it was honestly difficult to watch The film was way too long even for a good film so the fact it was absolutely awful made it unbearable This film had so much potential to be good especially due to the famous cast but it ended it up being so bad I do not recommend this film at all,Negative
Hope is a good thing maybe the best thingsaid AndyIve been told a couple of times this movie is a mustwatch before I die A movie with almost all actors and in a prison is a bit masculine to me Yet I occasionally read it on Wikipedia and also saw that in Netflix by chance I gave it a goOn the ground of some personal experience I could feel how Andy feels This movie is about persisting faith of oneself and of life even for those serving lifetime sentenceGet busy livin or get busy dyin is the best quote If you are in search of a powerhouse movie this would be the choiceI am from Hong Kong I would also recommend The Greed of a Man a Hong Kong drama and Itaewon Class a South Korea drama The male lead achieved their lifetime goal spending long enough time like Andy We all know they are fictions but so what Just learn the message,Positive
This is the best movie robbed of acclaim I dont care what anyone says about Forest Gump This movie is better in almost every category except music and maybe tied for movie of the yearTim Robbins acting is as good if not better than Hanks I always have a problem with the simpleton character getting acting nods as with the white trash and ghetto thug characters I think most of us can all do the Gumpy Slow Hick voice ala Cleatus the Slacked Jawed Yokel SimpsonsI cant quite remember how many Oscars Gump stole from this GEM of a movie but this movie blows me away on almost every level The quite passion the Robbins portrays is surpassed by no one except maybe the Freeman sidekick characterThis movie was of course a short story made into a movie S King i think and because of what it delivers i truly believe it to be the best movie of  and probably one of the top  movies of all time,Positive
Before I went to this film because my Grandson is nuts about this series of films I read one newspaper review It wasnt glowing but it was positive Unfortunately this is a mess Others have already talked about the issues I have Granted this is an empty headed summer movie it could still have been done with some serious thought I was hanging in there throughout with a new dinosaur attack every three minutes and velociraptors going at fifty miles per hour and not getting tired Humans being assaulted time after time and yet showing no fatigue I also didnt see a scratch on any of them But the best of all was the promise made to a baby dinosaur and his mother that precluded saving the world from famine Not to mentioned the coincidences of everyone showing up in just the right places I still dont understand how they got into that facility so easily The return of the original cast was not helpful other than Jeff Goldblums sarcasm Anyway its all been said This is a poor movie,Notr
This movie is good theres no question about that but he nd best ever Thats a bit of a stretch I cant really imagine that all of those people who gave this movie the  and  votes have seen very many other good movies  Sure the story is meaningful and its harsh etc but there are so many movies that are moving and powerful  The fact that Shawshank is  on this list is a reflection of those voting,Positive
Look all the negative comments on the movie is already stated below with the boring script lack of suspense so onOh that hand Chris Pratt holds up thatll really ward off those dinosaurs What kind of idiot thought that was a good ideaLook my problem is the total PC always in theses movies Whats the point of narrative when it comes to the main point it lacking in what you want on this type of filmI would not recommend this movie to even my enemies thats how bad it was thats saying something It is a marketing movie not a movie for the future to look back and say that was a great because of ABC reasonsRubbish totally forgettable movieHope this director is NOT making movies in the future,Notr
I think the producer didnt take serious about the movie making here the plot is not right It should be more smooth and with logic story but i know some movies didnt use the logical ideas but still can be interesting but not with this one I think the stars rating shows all regards,Negative
A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is Greatest movie ever made Get real Its not even the greatest prison movie ever made Hell its not even the best movie released in  Its predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clichs Its also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe Still its an entertaining movie Nice direction from Frank Darabont Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast Tim Robbins however is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly staresoffintothedistance moments Hes so far beneath Freeman as an actor its sad With a normal movie like this I would focus more on the positives I did give it a  after all Unfortunately it is easily the most overrated movie of all time on IMDb for sure and as such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack,Positive
Much like Venom last year Cats is a worst movie of the year that isnt all that bad The movie has its fair share of flaws but the bright spots are very brightThe CGI isnt as eye bleed worthy as I thought it would be the comedy was missplaced in some parts but in others made me chuckle the singing was inconsistent however mostly good as was the acting and overall look of the film was decent By far my biggest complaint is the lack of a compiling naritive The film was unclear in what its plot was until fairly far in and even when it did lay out its master plan I felt it was far too simple for a movie as long and as costly as this one wasWhat saves the movie is beautiful singing from Jennifer Hudson among others and musical set pieces that are a joy to watch I dont think I will rewatch this anytime soon but I kinda glad I did at least once,Negative
Remember how every Star Wars nerd reacted when the prequels came out how the second trilogy was lamented for not standing up to the originalsThe difference between those and Resurrections is that over time the second Star Wars trilogy aged like a fine wine and can be appreciated for what it is and can stand on its own three feetResurrections is hot garbage Cringeinducing throwbacks poor film quality bad cliches and a nonexistent story The fight scenes are dumb the climaxes nonclimaxial nothing engaging or thought provoking at all Characters are entirely forgettableIts like a group of people who had never seen The Matrix decided they needed to make another one Like Disney bought the rights and just completely rainbowpuked on an otherwise excellent universeIts bad Great for laughing at how bad it is but its bad,Notr
I thought it was very good I had the luxury of never having the opportunity to see this in the theatre but growing up hearing the music I was very much looking forward to this Its not theatre and its not exactly a movie Its something different and if you watch it through that lens you may really enjoy it Those with really bad reviews I think they had the experience but missed the meaning,Negative
I hate this movie I mean a movie about emojis What the hell were these people thinking First off the plot If you seen the endless spiral of cheesy Be YOURSELF kids movies you seen the plot of this Okay its this an emoji has more than one emotion gee where have Ive seen THIS before and the phone is getting deleted IDK what else the plot is but product placement or ads Second of all the characters Theyre the blandest characters Ive seen all year Gene is the generic guy who is different than the rest who is accepted in the end Hi whos idea of a name is this the comedy relief who is annoying and as hyperactive as a  year on sugar and Jailbreak the hardened chick who is kinda of a feminist that would fit in well with the Tumblr crowd of edgy  somethings Also there are other characters who are completely one dimensional and only used for teh plot andor comedy Finally this movie sucked big time The only positive thing is that most people hate it including children That restored some of my faith in humanity Anyways this is Princess Radar signing out,Negative
Theres really nothing to endear this movie to anyone Its literally the same disaster as Hotdog Party and then some with everyone except the dysfunctional Stepford Emoji leader worried about being deleted If I add anything more it will probably end up being a spoiler so Ill stop here Not recommending it Dont waste your spare change on this one,Negative
the rating of this movie  at the moment and not the movie is what pisses me off I watched quit a few movies and all I can tell is there are lots of garbage movies with a rating around  to  this movie is a solid  or  if it comes to the movie itself but unfortunately people are not rating the movie but how bad it is compared to the real deal dragonball dragonball is a  on the scale thats how awesome it is and thats why people are so angryI guess most people expected dragonball evolution to easily become the best movie ever made since it is based on the most successful anime ever madeand since it failed to be as awesome as the anime its a  what logicim very sorry for ya fans to not being able to enjoy this movie,Negative
This movie is a lazy lackluster attempt to try to modernize the matrix Piloted by a clearly aging Keanu Reeves The Matrix Resurrections features poor action horrible cinematography and disappointing performances galore The part I personally found insulting was the constant use of actual footage from the first  films as if they thought the audience needed a constant reminder of what had already happened It is clear that either Lana Wachowski has completely lost the plot or that this film was intentionally sabotaged to serve as a satire of reboots It is clear that theres bad blood between Lana Wachowski and Warner Brothers as it is quite literally stated in the film that they were forced to make another sequel whether they wanted to or not,Notr
Andy Dufresne Robbins a well educated banker is wrongfully convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in prison at Shawshank Penitentiary This movie follows his life as it falls apart and he succumbs to living as an inmate surrounded by hardened criminals and a strict bible thumping warden with his henchmen prison guardsSaw this movie years ago and was absolutely stunned This film is a genuine masterpiece and probably the greatest movie ever made Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are amazing and just steal the show as convicts turned best friends The movie is perfectly paced with very real characters and emotions that are all captivating The prison itself is very authentic and the set pieces are very realistic which captured the prison environment better than any other prison set film except for maybe Escape From Alcatraz Even as a hard drama this movie is never slow or boring or dry it is simply just that good,Positive
Dont listen the critics from this old people this movie is nice for kids not for mature people who dont understand this new and modern world Its a fun movie with a story line only did it for kids so i dont understand this crazy people giving dislike to a kids movie when there are worst movies only for adult,Negative
Save your money or watch ipman  instead of this trash,Negative
The whole movie would be  times better if its pure comedy and rated r like Deadpool too,Negative
The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece of storytelling acting and emotion The film perfectly balances hope patience and friendship keeping viewers deeply engaged from start to finish Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver unforgettable performances making every scene impactfulThe pacing is slow at times but intentional allowing the story and characters to develop naturally Emotional moments hit hard without feeling forced and the ending is deeply satisfyingA mustwatch for anyone who loves strong storytelling memorable characters and timeless life lessons,Positive
That scene with Chris Pratt with his hand out and Blue with its baby Thats exactly what it looked like to me Good blue roll over Im being generous giving this movie three stars out of  What was that madness What a ridiculous way to end the Jurassic Park legacy Coexisting with a planet of dinosaurs I cant imagine anyone being in a theater subjected to that mess Cocaine is alive and well amongst the writersAs I watched it all I could do was try to relate to it as a Hollywood cartoon or animated fantasy just to give myself a reason to keep watching it The level of melodrama was astounding At least in the original Jurassic Park there was an air of possibility Michael Crichtons story True wonderment,Notr
This may just be the worst movie of  Poorly done CGI aside the writing is bland the characters have little to no character development and the pacing goes from breakneck to nonexistent The plot if you can even call it that barely exists That and whenever this movie isnt so bad its funny this movie commits the worst crime of all that being its so boring to sit through With the addition of the aforementioned poorly done CGI things go from bad to worse as if you ask me a good superhero movie typically relies on two things Visuals and plot And if those two elements are poorly done the movie is poorly done,Notr
Its a master piece The special effect of the plot the charcters omg this Is the Best movie in the wooooooooorld i think the internet dont apreciate this movie but if you look the new Dragon Ball series and movies you Will check that thats a really good movie the only think that you say wow this Is really strange its picolo design but well you can ignore that because its a great villain with purpose and its not a cat with op Powers AND the fact woho was film un Mxico only says that its a world film AND better that Mxico series sorry but this Is the movie who you really nees to see its a master piece,Negative
I think that a huge part of humanity lost its grace depth and strength I dont know why Something changedThe Matrix Resurrections feels like people just had some fun doing this stuff acting etc Feels like old friends gathered to see each other and to make some money if possibleThere are some crucial new ideas as a continuation of the story I appreciate that new meaning but it feels like this movie could have been done much better In some waysProbably this movie is an answer to those studios that own rights on intellectual properties Its an answer to those studios that probably want to make money by exploiting the sacred and dear art pieces of old daysMany are shortsighted these days Will it come to a world war once Will there be a cleaning of too shortsighted errors of nature or we will be just passively fading away until its too late Maybe Im too shortsighted to see the value of The Matrix ResurrectionsThanks for the efforts anyway,Notr
CATS was everything and anything I expected of this movie Loving the live musical I didnt expect this movie to NOT be weird and it  delivered on all of its weirdness The music is beautiful and haunting because ALW is the MAN when it comes to music If you go into this movie ready to inspect every detail and wondering Wait how did this happen or why did this happen then you are very much so missing the entire essence of this show This movie takes you into a different world and you dont leave it till the very last second Have fun enjoy the weird and let the memory LIVE AGAIN I for sure have tickets to see it again tomorrow ,Negative
Had such high expectations  years on and the technologyspecial effects would be even more amazing  it was so disappointing The fight scenes were blurred and confusing Neo and Trinity nearly pulled it off as actors on their own but with Mr Anderson and Morpheus missing the original actors it just didnt get there I scored the original a   one of the best movies Ive ever seen You would think this was different writers and directors it was that poor,Notr
Michael MorbiusJared Leto a doctor who is slowly dying from a rare blood disease struggles to find a cure when he thinks he has but things work a little too well until he discovers theres more supernatural to it then he could have imaginedIt was entertaining but to much feels taken out like it was supposed to be R rated but they decided at the last minute decided to take out most of the violence in order to get a PG  Everybody plays there roles pretty well Jared Leto does alright has Morbius but the film itself is pretty cliched but still fun and entertaining and if that is all you want then Morbius does deliver,Notr
"I went to have fun Its Colin and millions of dollars It should be good right

The Matrix Resurrection is the latest blockbuster lean on nostalgia But instead appears only for the sake of nostalgia itself the film dares to challenge and twist the narrative and continuously make it fresh Not as groundbreaking as the original but still giving you a fun ride at the big screenToo bad there are too many expositions and its a little bit annoying The film is also a bit lacking in the action department especially since the great Yuen Wooping isnt involved anymoreJessica Henwick is a revelation,Notr
The original Matrix is an absolute classic  The two sequels were good  or  but with pretty confusing storylines in partsThis film is truly dreadful Surprisingly awful in factThe trailor takes tiny snapshots of the film and make it look like a fantastic blockbuster but in reality it is a nostalgiaheavy poorly thought out and terribly acted remake of sorts of the first filmThe storyline and the number of pointless easter eggsrepeats of the first film make this a largely pointless addition to the original trilogySave your money or go and see Spiderman instead ,Notr
Since its early debut Ive been expecting it to be mediocre but not like this I cringed each time dialogs were spoken in between fight sceneswhat little they hadand seeing the work put into the CG Ive never been raped before but I think I have a pretty good idea how it feels and to celebrate this historical moment in cinema I thought of a fitting term for daily use Anything that is considered an extreme failure like getting divorced losing a child or getting hit by a car all in the same day would now be replaced by the word Dragonball So today Ive been dragonballed for  hour and a half and nothing can erase the horrors I witnessed during that time DONT SEE THIS DRAGONBALL  FOR GODS SAKE ,Negative
Just like the song says You gotta know when to hold em They should have folded it at a trilogy There are moments that live up to the originals but not enough Cringe worthy ones include Jada Smith and her ridiculous makeup and the new agent smiths clunky fight scenes PLEASE dont make any more,Notr
This movie should have never been made Thank god Akria Toryimia agreed with us and made Battle of Gods and Resurrection F Hollywood needs to stop screwing up stuff that is better as it is Heck this movie should be banned worldwide Just so everyone knows I love the Dragon Ball series minus this god awful movie This movie is worse then a lot of remakes I have seen To me and a lot of other anime fans who love DBZGT this movie makes us want to die or puke it doesnt matter which I really hate this movie I would wither watch Barney the dinosaur over this movie I hate this movie because they messed up Goku Also because they messed up all the characters and the events,Negative
Finally I got a chance to see Inception today I went in with high expectations knowing how much I was impressed by The Dark Knight Christopher Nolans first true masterpiece After watching the movie was I impressed Yes Completely blown away Yes This movie indeed is Nolans second masterpieceThe movie involves some awesome CGI works powerful acting by the whole cast and an intricate yet engaging story line Films with equally good CGI have released in the past so there is nothing new about it We have also seen similarly themed movies so it is not really the theme which distinguishes the movie So what actually makes the movie so goodOne reason is the directors ability to make you connect with every dream scene in the movie When you watch the movie during many of the dream scenes youll feel Hey something like this has happened to me before or Yes This is exactly how its supposed to happen in dreamsSecond is the plot Nolan invites you to a world of his own presents you the possibilities and the dangers of the world and then builds a plot based on that world a plot so brilliant that in the end you are left dumbstruck in awe Similar attempts have been made before Steven Spielberg for example with his Minority Report and I must say this is the best such attempt everOverall a heavily engaging movie possibly the best movie of the year,Positive
There are few movies that capture and identify with the American male spirit Shawshank is one of those movies I dont care what anyones take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal this movie is moving There are three movies in my opinion that every man or developing man should watch Shawshank Redemption Dancing With Wolves and Brave Heart Unless you are a total pansy these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality Andy Dufrane is the person in us Red is the person we want to be Aside from the being in prison the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation,Positive
It was on my watchlist since its release but due to some reasons I watched it now in  Considering it a movie for children from age  to  its still too much simple and if we consider it for under  its way too complicated I guess this movie targets only children who are  years old haha Well that was a boring calculation but not as boring as the film itself Way too oversimplified and unattractive I expect better from Sony entertainment This film is everything but fun ride Youll get chunks of everything but not a spoonful of anything Not even music fullfils the shallow body of film A missed attempt I must say Avoid it though its nothing special Watch inside out instead,Negative
"The story Incredibly cliched
The jokes not funny and sometimes to the point where it doesnt even make any sense I still wake up in cold sweats about the clock one
The characters every bad kids movie character combined
The message be yourself Gee how innovative and creative also theres an out of place feminism theme thats just jarring
Animation is the only good thing about this dumpster fire Please dont watch this",Negative

The music was good and I enjoyed the eye candy But this wasnt DBZ Instead of calling it Dragonball Evolution They could have removed all Dragonball references and named it something else,Negative
Honestly I liked it It just felt so rushed that I could never have an emotional attachment to anything or anyone If they took an extra  minutes to let the story naturally progress instead of just hurrying it along as fast as they could it wouldve been better,Notr
Morbius is a well made film Unlike the reviews which completely put down the movie I believe that it was enjoyable I am not a Marvel Fan and have never read the comicsI enjoyed the good graphics face design and design of Morbiuss powers and how they are visualisedThe film had no negatives but lacked a wow factor that would make it I have noticed though that the story felt like it had an abrupt ending The goal of the main protagonist doesnt appear to be realised its just that a fight has been wonIt felt like given  minutes more of screentime the story could have been taken to a better place,Notr
The story was definitely mixed up a bit fusing some elements of certain points of the actual story so that they could be DONE with Dragonball and Work on with DBZFor all of you Whiney boo hoo babies out there that are mad about the changesdont watch the movie because you simply will not like itit stays completely true to the series and adds a more realistic touch to it and thats that If you havent already seen this movie and you know that you arent expecting DragonBall  then go see it if you want  Dragonball with all the goods then go make one and then lets have a chat but as for me i loved the movie and im a HUGE fan of the series i can tell all the changes that theyve made but hey heres the thing WATCH the movie  time then compare and contrast the nd time dont walk in all OMG this is gonna suck big time they spoiled DB for life,Negative
THIS MOVIE WILL MAKE YOU AND YOUR KIDS STUPID Id rather have a buffalo take a diarrhea dump in my ear then watch this movie Id also rather eat the rotten ahole of a roadkill skunk and down it with beer This movie is Fkin AWFUL Every time i see something related to it I want to KILL myself Also The Emoji Movie has a deal with McDonalds McDonalds is SO GULLIBLE,Negative
i watch this movie for minimum  times first to last so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time its a piece of art and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence so i rate this movie  out of  because of amazing screen play acting casting background scoring editing etc this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake,Positive
Inception is a movie that blew the majority of us away when it was released into cinemas worldwide But it left many wondering about the character Cob which I wont mentionAnyway Inception is about a group of very skilled people whose job it is to enter other peoples dreams to alter their real life ideas and decisions The main character CobLeonardo DiCaprio and his friend and colleague Arther Joseph Gordon Levitt are tasked to perform something called Inception from Saito Ken Watanabewho is the owner of a powerful corporation And his goal is to bring down another company to make his the leading company in the world of energyDirector Christopher Nolan The Dark Knight  does a very sterling job as he delivers a fantastic film with lots to enjoy from chase scenes beautiful scenery and a twisting story lines Nolans choice of cast couldnt get any better as they all impressed me with their super sonic performances Nolan also adds a layer of complexity about the dream world to deepen the concept You wont all understand it straight away but a little thought and you should get thereFurthermore there are scenes which blow me away with suspense and thrill Especially when learning about dreams and who Cob was recruiting for his team Their strategy to complete the job from Saito is very interestingOverall This film is an amazing experience to watch and will not keep you bored for any second Top performances from DiCaprio GordonLevitt and Ellen Page and great cinematography to lose yourself in Nolan has produced an mind blowing piece of film which is still talked about today,Positive
This film completely fails to understand what made Dragon Ball special in the first place The characters barely resemble their original versions the story is simplified to the point of being meaningless and the tone feels wrong from beginning to end Even if you forget that it is supposed to be an adaptation it still doesnt work as a fantasy or action movie The pacing is weak the fights are uninspired and nothing feels memorable Its not just a bad adaptation its a bad movie in general and a huge waste of a beloved franchise,Negative
If you are a true DBZ fan avoid even thinking about watching this garbage Its a shame too see such slaughtering of the original This so called DBZ Action Adventure Fantasy film offers the followingLame action scenes Cheesy dialogues CGI from the s for the power blasts Unbelievable weak plots Reincarnated Piccolo yeah Inappropriate casting laughable costumes Filled with all the clichs you can imagine And you know what the list stretches But I am going to stop right here and urge you all to watch DBZ series than waisting time and money on this ShT,Negative
"Dragonball Evolution is a comical movie Surprisingly it made me laugh a lot The acting was alright and the story was so messy A lot of the time I was completely confused at what was happening Plus I was not expecting to see Emmy Rossum The only thing that kept me watching was the action It was so amazing I loved the fight scene with Jamie Chung and herself It was choreographed really well Yet this movie in no way reminds me of Dragonball I have never watched it but Ive seen pictures and some videos
If the story wasnt so sloppy this movie couldve been great",Negative
While this is the movie of the year to hate ignore them there is no rationale reason to hate on this I have seen my share of sub star films and this is not one of themI watched it with my children age range  and they all enjoyed it It has an appropriately positive message for children It keeps a good pace It held the attention of my four year old for the entire length and that alone makes it worth it,Negative
Not even a single second of entertainment in the movieThe worst movie I have ever watched Who is the Dump ass behind this ideaNot even good for kids since it have technical terms which is tough for them to understand Using shabby words is also not good for kidsThe animation at its worst as if we were watching s movies on a old television,Negative
I love the Batman movies They have a lot of fantastic elements which include action which is perfected,Positive
Look I know that everyone is dumping on this movie and honestly I dont see why This movie was bad like that other movie that came out in  and we all knew would suck and when it came out sucked ghostbusters anyone Nobody was surprised that this sucks nobody was sitting slack jawed in the theater going OH MY GOD THIS LOOKED SO GOOD IN THE TRAILERS if you want to see the movie just watch the trailers because honestly thats all you need to see The characters are basically described with one phrase Jean is the special one Jailbreak is the strong female character  and high five is the  comic relief None of this movie is original none of this movie is good It is just a blatant cash grab from a terrible company who has no clue what anyone is interested in these days I made an account just to review this movie and I dont think Ill do it again unless I see a fidget spinner movie in two years,Negative
The ONLY reason I rated this above a  was because of Jennifer Hudson She had one great scene The rest was like a really bad dream while on shrooms,Negative
I would rather drown in a fire than watch it again,Negative

I really wish I could give this movie a zero There are literally no redeemable qualities You cant even argue that the animation was good because by this point its impossible to make it ugly unless you screw up by godly proportions The sad thing is this movie wasnt a failure It made crap loads of money even though everyone hated itPlease stop ironically giving this product good reviews And someone hand me a bottle of cyanide,Negative
I loved it OK I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and I love dark movies with great twists I loved MementoPrestige I had to watch it twice to understand itI have seen dreams inside dreams inside dreams so I got the movie from the moment it started I will not spoil it too much but everything in the movie are explained clearly The mystery of the movie is inside the mind of Cobb He is hiding his subconscious guilt and still playing the game of inception with his team members This is the most difficult job he has to do and all the time he is haunted by his wife The movie is understandable Leonardo Dicaprios one of the best performance after The Blood Diamond Ellen Page is absolutely the character Nolan wanted from her She is a brilliant architect and also curious about all the mysteries that goes around Cobbs life This is the first movie I have seen of Joseph GordonLevitt I loved his character balanced and funny sometimes This is the first movie of this summer that I am going to watch a second time and may be third,Positive
Beautiful Amazing Breathtaking As a huge Matrix fan I couldnt wait to watch Resurrections and it exceeds all my expectations Full with metaphors and analogies which means it is for those who can open their minds and who are able to experience this world or other worlds on another level as wellWell done Lana well done Thank youIf you are reading this and havent seen the movie yet please dont believe the haters Let your own heart guide you and make your own choice We are controlled in so many other ways,Notr
An all star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio Ken Watanabe Tom Hardy  Cillian Murphy  othersA great but complex film about a team of thieves who specialise in entering the dreams of their victims in order to steal their secrets from their subconsciousIve seen this film  times  highly recommend watching it if you havent already but be warned it requires unbreakable concentrationThe storyline is very imaginative but complex as the team enter dreams within dreams within other dreams so if youre not concentrating  you miss something its likely you will become confused  even disinterested in the rest of the film probably why Ive had to watch it  times lolGive it a watch or  You wont be disappointed,Positive
Great mind bending movie you cannot imagine second secne in this film and cannot imagine ending,Positive
Nice direction and animation and superb technology but an adaption of Inside out and inferior to it,Negative
Dragonball Evolution was a movie I hated when I went to go see it in theaters but I was  years old when I watched it I just recently saw the movie and my opinions about the movie somewhat changed The fight scenes are silly some of the time yet entertaining The acting is tolerable and the special effects are okay James Wan gave us a HORRIBLE adaptation to the manga if not the anime I felt that if someone who actually watched the damn anime or bothered to do the movie justice at all would direct this movie a whole lot better However this movie holds a place in my heart like The Last Airbender did and Ill always enjoy it,Negative
As a tribute to the dreadful tunesmith LloydWebber it was a perfect career ending debacle  for a weapon of mass destruction Even if they had a sudden urgent tax bill to pay I cant see why some serious star performers didnt sue their agents for even suggesting they might appear,Negative

th review Superb Great Masterpiece Unforgettable Excellent Brilliant No no  no I have been thinking for months to find a word that can describe the film Nothings found yet and  to be honest I think nothing will be found forever The movie cant be expressed by words Words are unable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this masterpiece But Im hopeful to be able one day to express my feelings about it because hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies When it come to the Shawshank Redemption I prefer to remain silent because silence is full of unspoken words,Positive
This movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic brilliance    The direction is nothing to write home about the cinematography is frankly standard  The script has Steven King written all over it  a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors  A good example the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoners interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience Its all about TIME and PRESSURE just in case anyone managed to miss the connection Morgan Freeman is as usual superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand  While the films sympathetic liberal political stance can be commended its certainly not a great work of art,Positive
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight and the Sisters let him beWe know how all that turned out Shawshank Didnt do as well at the movies but wow on the dvd sales And after this many years it still holds over  on Imbd  ImpressiveI wish there was little more substance for the ending  like where was Red going to live  With Andy Would have been nice to see the outcome of the guardThe movie was was it was and I could watch it every time its on tv  Tim was with Susan S for over  years but never married  Dang that is somethingGet busy living ,Positive
Most people commenting havent even seen the movie and are just trying to give it a bad rating Theyre called trollsI havent seen the movie yet so I cant give it a review However theres no debate its better than Fallen Kingdom that was a disaster,Notr
A modern masterpiece of st Century Cinema The Dark Knight combines great direction with brilliant acting and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in why practical effects should not be a thing of the past and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right It serves as a comic book film but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality with one of the best villains of the last  years On top of that Christopher Nolans unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience,Positive
i love Dragon ball since i was a little boyNow there make it real in live action film First things i though in my head can they really make this movieAfter i finish watch this movie at cinema i found that this movie is a Blast But the effect was horrible by the way i love Goku Bulma and Chi Chi Their acting was good i Love Justin Chatwin Emmy Rossum and Jaime Chung They really perfect for their roleFor those who Just want to enjoy and relaxing at cinema i suggest u to see this movie i laugh every time i see at funny part But I know some of you did not like this movie No matter what are you saying to this movie i will still love it,Negative
 is the actual score I want to postbasically do not watch this movie  E V E R It is not really anything to do with dragonballzgt They took the characters about  of the plot and sucked the soul out of the whole thing firmly bending it over and totally ing it up beyond all recognitionEven people who have never had contact with the original manga and anime will say this is the worst movie ever producedSo much is wrong with it It is impossible to defend thisplease torture to death those responsible for this horrific clusterI mean did they really think that fans of the original series would watch this Any fan of the series would have walked out after the first  minutesand i am being generous and demanded a refund and possibly compensation for severe mental traumaBURN ALL COPIES AND NEVER LET THIS HORROR HAPPEN AGAIN ANYONE INVOLVED IN CREATING THIS SHOULD NEVER WORK AGAIN ANYONE INVOLVED IN CREATING THIS SHOULD ISSUE A FORMAL APPOLOGY TO THE FAN BASEI WOULD SOONER WATCH A STATIONARY TURD AS IT DECOMPOSES THAN WATCH THIS MOVIE EVER AGAIN,Negative

Im a huge Nolan fan and I always get those goosebumps moments in his films where it just HITS me like a ton of bricks I get this movie I get the deeper meaning behind it I get the reason for it And Nolan sent that message in the most genius way Wow Its probably different for different people but some examples it was when black merged into white in Memento it was when Joker was upside down opposite of Batman and talking about human nature their duality gravity etc it was when the audience discovered the Prestige had been done on us etcHowever that doesnt happen for me in Inception I loved the movie So unique so entertaining but Im not sure if I truly GET IT Ive seen it like  times and Ill come up with a explanation and an underlying theme then secondguess it the next time I watch it Ive read many explanations or better yet interpretations of Inception online but none made an airtight case for me Perhaps thats the reason obviously he intended ambiguity but I need more At best its one film where you can have conversations with different groups and all come up with something totally different each time Thought provoking at its finest,Positive
Ok you wanted to make it anywayWhy on earth did you came up with such a poor script About  years passed and no interesting ideas appearedIs a shame this movie is called MatrixI was pretty mad viewing the first part wich was some kind of parody with characters lacking interestThen the movie just forgot it is intended to entertain the viewerSuch a disrespectful movie to its legacy,Notr

Inception is a beautiful piece of film that has impacted a large part of the film industry With everything from the actors to the cinematography to the music this movie without any elaboration perfected almost everything there isInceptions slow start is the only weak point of this movie It begins intensely to then slows down for the next    minutes While then finishing off as an impeccable film Nevertheless this is what brings the film down for meThe director Christopher Nolan managed to create a masterpiece with little to no mistakes At no point during this intensely long movie did I feel bored Instead I was always excited and on my toes intriguedThe acting in this movie was phenomenal A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didnt win an Oscar for his performanceMeanwhile also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer the music adds significantly The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested Few composers can make you notice the music but Zimmer succeeds per usualTo finish of the film was astonishingly shot With beautiful eyecatching scenes While also containing some incredible action scenes that might be some of the best action Ive seen With a thoughtprovoking storyline that finishes of with an unbelievable endingI highly recommend Inception to everyone and I promise you wont be disappointed,Positive
Superb movie Based on a Stephen King short story the story of Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins sent to prison for murdering his wife and her lover In prison he is befriended by Red Redding Morgan Freeman who helps him survive the harsh prison lifeA beautiful moving story Characters are steadily and solidly developed and you feel an empathy for the main characters Direction by Frank Darabont is subtle and perfect Pacing is spot onTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are excellent in the lead roles Freeman got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his effortsWell deserving of all the praise heaped upon it Just a pity it didnt garner any Oscars losing out in the most part to a far inferior movie Forrest Gump,Positive
I imagine the very low rating has to do more with peoples hate obsession with Jared letos  minutes as the joker than the actual movie It isnt bad especially for an mcu movie Not saying its anything special but its nice that it is a little different like people actually die like a comic book lolIt is short for an mcu movie so it feels like it may have been rushed but I dont think thats a bad thing If they dragged it out I would have rated it lowerI say watch it For the better part of mcu being done and the new stuff lately pretty much sucks this is actually one of the best Thats the end of my Ted talk so now down vote this lol,Notr
"HonestlyI went into this hoping for a trainwreck I saw the reviewsand laughed But this was not what I expected Cats  feels like someone tried to digitize a Broadway production of the play but the computer focused too much on face recognition The choreo and singing feels straight out of the musical no modern hip hop remixes here All the main cats get their own songsand they may just be only introducing themselves and thats itbut theyre all done well and I enjoyed some of it a lot especially the opening number Memories actually brought me to tearssomething that doesnt happen very often
The obvious elephant in the room is the CGI whichyesdoes look freakish at firstbut by the last third I didnt care
This isnt the holiday smash hit the studio was hoping for but when you realize that it is currently going up against Star Wars there is little hope for this to make much of a mark at the box office",Negative

Its back to the Matrix roots and only has a slight tranny flair that Lana couldnt escape from I guess all her sibling brought to the table was extra restraint which might have made this film better but its hard to knowMatrix  and  were disappointments for me but people that liked them will appreciate this movie because it builds on top of the story of those movies tooIts fun It has a story to tell and its repetition isnt as bad the Star Wars rehashes because repetition is part of the story of The MatrixIt has flaws but not too many I think this movie will be enjoyed by nearly everyoneThe ending is a bit gay but nothing to ruin the story unlike most other Hollywood movies out thereThis is a pretty good thirdsequel which isnt saying much,Notr
No one should Ever have the misfortune of watching this movie,Negative
It was ok I watched the original trilogy leading up to seeing Resurrections Maybe that was a mistake The first thing I notice was how the quality seemed lowerwhich should be impossible with how much newer the technology is I have my suspicions as to why they would allow us to feel that way in the opening sequence But without knowing their motivation I was left underwhelmed and actively thinking how this felt cheapThe story is alright nothing special There are a few familiar faces But I never felt a connection to the new ones For such a long movie it felt lacking in storytelling which shouldnt be possibleIf they make another one Ill probably watch it But this movie either didnt need to be made or needed more time cooking I do wonder if missing onehalf of the original visionaries meant we also lost half of the vision and creativity,Notr

THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen Kings more restrained kind of stories dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale endsTIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN who plays the narrator with great dignity describes himself as the only guilty man in Shawshank The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape Along the way he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that theres a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing A touch of irony here no The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison talebut still they make an impact because of all that happens beforeIts a bittersweet story a sort of horrific fairytale of what might have happened but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful storytelling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay,Positive
This will be a very short comment I dont like writing a lot Goku here is cocky In the anime he isnt Gokus hair looks more like his sons Goku doesnt go to high schoolGohan does It looked horribly like power rangers Special effects were ridiculous The Plot was stupid Piccolo was laughableThese are some of the reasons I didnt like the movie I guess it might be somewhat enjoyable for people who either A Like Power Rangers B Hate Dragonball C Never have seen Dragonball,Negative

Do not let anyone tell you anything about this movie before you go see it It is best experienced with thrilled expectations  and you will not be disappointed The acting by all cast members is terrific the story line is amazing and the special effects are breathtaking I am so honored to have attended a sneak preview of this movie The theater was packed without one empty seat and the crowd was so into the movie it was silent until the end Their reaction at the end was loud and vocal I will admit that I got a terrible tension headache from the intensity of being a part of this experience But I will never ever forget the movie I also must admit there were several times while watching the movie that I wanted someone to explain things to me I commented to my husband  WTF but rode it out thinking comprehending and understanding I do think that younger people will get the story better than older people since they play multitiered level games so the concept wont be so difficult to wrap their brains around it Outside the theater afterward no one would leave  they just stood around talking about it reliving scenes ideas and concepts This is THE movie to see,Positive

A young boy named Goku Justin Chatwin sets out upon his grandfathers dying request to find the great Master Roshi and gather all seven Dragon Balls of which he has one in order to prevent Piccolo from succeeding in his desire to use the Dragon Balls to take over the world The movie itself wasnt all that bad but the direction and the cinementography was way off Csting was soso Justin Chatwin being one of the main and so was Emmy Rossum I was surprised to spot Ernie Hudson among the cast So overall the movie passed my liking being greater than that cheesy Street Fighter movie that came out this past February Dragonball Evolution ,Negative
Bogus good reviews abound on this movie  all you have to do is check to see if the reviewer ever wrote a review before and then ask yourself why they would choose this to be their first amazing review You have to assume the studio paid for those ones because they needed to have some good reviewsThis movie is peppered with stars so youd think it would be good CGI has come so far so youd think that would be good too But somehow it just added to how terrible this isThe CGI is awful The script is awful Some of the songs that were great on stage are somehow awful The blame lies with whoever decided not to animate this and went with CGI insteadI have never seen so many famous names in a cast and thought wow this was a pile of poopWait for it on Netflix for free its that bad And there were only about  people in my showing and  of them left and never returned Thats how tragic this movie is and its a great musical on Broadway just so NOT in this movie Its a razzie contender for sure,Negative
I was afraid to dislike it since many people put a bad review but I was really surprised that I actually loved it The story is well developed and so are the characters I didnt get bored at all and the visual effects are insane Even though its not quite what a Marcel fan would expect its still a wonderful movie I would recommend it gladly to people who like me fear to dislike it because of the reviews,Notr
I was so eager for this movie And probably that is why it seemed like a letdown to meThe movie plays with The Matrix world but it lost all the charms it had  years agoEven Keanu as Neo didnt has the same dynamic anymoreThe movie did a bad job in every aspect whether it is direction storyline characters cinematography etcThe action sequences was decent at bestMatrix  was so amazing with action and now after  years this is the one thing in which they could do a really good job but it was so bad that it felt like watching a TV series rather than a movie in some scenesNew Morpheus was not serious but kinda like cranky New agent smith was somewhat watchable also Neil did a good job as an antagonist who was not powerfulPlot was so loose that they didnt offer anything good to the storyOverall it was not upto a good movie standard let alone considering it a Matrix partHope they dont repeat it ever again,Notr
They try so hard to make it more exciting complex and fun But sorry its confusing To put old cast with the new ones is a good idea but the story is not strong enough to make me believe that they belong together Its just weak,Notr
A truly fun and exciting return to the matrixEverything in the universe evolved and grew in a logical and believable way I was amazed how lana watchowsky delivered the movie in such a way you would think she directed the last Matrix just a few years ago instead it was  years since the first oneWhat im trying to say is if you are a matrix fan you wont be dissapointedSupporting characters were suprisingly likable and interestingHugo Weiving was missed but the story redemeed his absense in a really interesting wayDont get too stressed reading some of the dissapointments here in the review and feel guilty about liking Matrix  we s kids deserved thisIm truly happy this film exists,Notr
Christopher Nolan is one of the few filmmakers in the world today with the ability to make a big budget blockbuster that is truly original Inception is like nothing you have ever seen before The plot involves a world where the technology exists to allow people to invade the dreams of others This technology has a practical use if you make your living stealing ideas like Leonardo DiCaprios character doesBeyond that I wont say anything about the plot because the less you know going in the better I will say that the story is nothing short of incredible I cant imagine the amount of work it took to write such a complex script and still have it all come together neatly with zero plot holes I have this image in my head of Nolan drawing these massive flow charts with a thousand bubbles on a giant dryerase boardThis film will please every kind of moviegoer from the averagejoe who likes action and special effects to the hard core film nerd that likes to analyze every second of screen time this movie works on enough levels to please them allNolan does require of his audience the ability to pay very close attention for the entire  hours but if you give him that hell take you on an incredible journey Inception is truly one of the best films ever made,Positive
"Somehow earning a whopping  morbillion dollars at the box office morbius stands as one of the greaters achievements of film that man has ever made No morbs nor words can describe the mastermorb that this morb has morbed and i implore you all to watch it effective immediately That being said morbius is still one of the movies of all time and the medium does not allow itself to express its greatness and after having watched morb man doing morb stuff  times the movie does get a little stale i know the true morbers between you will scream blasphemy but it is the truth morbius will no longer rule over my life but shall now be a distant memory as i take on pastures new Though i shall never forget the joy and happiness that morbius  has brought me that is allI only have one more thing to say to you

I am a huge Fan Of Christopher Nolan Since Memento he is in my Opinion One of the Best Directors Of the Last  Decades Inception here reminds probably to be his best Movie together with The Dark Knight I dont want to Spoil here anything so i just can recommand it to everyone to watch this Movie it will blow you away,Positive

I went into the movie theater thinking this movie was going to be bad but I actually kind of liked it There was a few minor things that I didnt like about it but I thought it actually represented the characters somewhat true to the series I also think that the movie summed up the whole dragon ball series story in about an hour and a half but to be perfectly honest the story for dragon ball really doesnt make much sense either but they did an okay job putting it on the big screen I do have to admit that I probably wouldnt watch this movie again unless it just happened to be on tv and there was nothing better on and I definitely would not buy the movie but it is worth seeing at least once All and all I thought it was pretty entertaining,Negative
Resurrections was silly shallow constant flashbacks exposition and lacked any magic I was ready to turn it off  mins in The original Matrix is my fav movie saw it in the theater in ,Notr
The movie is so cursed that it made Akira start writing again good jobOk but also the movie is a lot of misinformation in one single place with all the confusion it can physically contain BUT if you consider this movie a big parody it is kind of funny in a twisted way almost like a trash comedy filmSo yeah as a Dragon Ball fan I cannot give it a low rating because it made Akira literally pick up the series not even kidding and also as an anime fan in general this really made producers think twice before picking up an anime to adapt into live action later movies still made some mistakes but they are still an EVOLUTION from this,Negative
Ive been waiting for this one with anticipation and I was thoroughly disappointed I spent the first  minutes wondering what was going on It was barely coherent The rest of the movie got slightly better But there was no real story Some parts were enjoyable Some werent But at the end I didnt feel like my day had been enriched by watching it and I have no desire to watch it again The original Matrix on the other hand I still watch that at least once a year This movie was done strictly as a money grab There was no real story to tell and no journey to follow I dont recommend it,Notr
A typical example of a marvel film that because its not the best movie people have ever seen they rate it a one star I can only assume these are reviews written by children or the very young The film is a solid piece of entertainment good acting effects and characters No its not up there with End Game but it shouldnt have to be Still a decent film and worth a watch The sort is a little formula driven but this doesnt detract from the overall enjoyment Leto is pretty good as is Smith both realistically portraying their characters My review is honest as is the number of stars awarded,Notr
"Cinemascore polled audiences after watching the movie and the average rating was B on a scale from F to A This means this movie generally was given ratings from C to A I give it an AI know too well

I know Best Movie Ever sounds like such a clich a phrase used to death Many people use it on movies which really do not deserve to be called the best movie ever I believe that the phrase  Best Movie Ever should be reserved for one movie only The Shawshank Redemption Not so long ago on IMDb The Shawshank Redemption was ranked nd This naturally compelled me to buy it and then i discovered what makes up a truly great movieSimple plot wonderfully acted and directedSince watching The Shawshank Redemption i have been preaching to all my friends to watch it And here i must do the same It is ranked  on IMDb for a reason It is the best ever It will move you You will love it If you havent seen it watch it,Positive
It is unrealistic too drawn out the plot is lousy and seems non existent It just has scenes that are action packed yet unsatisfying The timing makes it more absurd The lines are so vapid The stars featured do not distract me from how bad it isThe most original things are little noticable things that still do not make it worthwhile such as a flying motorcycle and people sneaking into a prohibited area It is sickening I am glad that I was treated to this garbage but disheartened that I had to sit through it I recommend skipping it,Notr
OK I get itThe guy who plays Goku isnt Japanese And the girl who plays Bulma doesnt have blue hair And the guy who plays Yamcha has a dye job And theres no Krillin And Gokus not a kid And Piccolo doesnt have his green antennae And theyre in high school And Roshi isnt a creepy perv But heres the thing CALM DOWNDragonball  the series is incredible not to mention complex And a cartoon To make a movie out of it they had to trim some stuffSo Dragonball Evolution isnt a perfect replica of the series But it does its best to stay true to the material and the charactersIf youre looking for the exact spoton down to the last detail movie about young Goku and his search for the dragonballs  youll be disappointedBut if you want to sit back relax and open your mind to this interpretation I think youll find it enjoyable,Negative

I had seen the trailers and was not impressed and only went to see it because James Marsters was Piccolo and surprise surprise I LOVED the movie Going to go see it again and have preordered the DVD I had seen some of the TV series but on the big screen with real actors was awesome Dont follow the sheep that were bad mouthing this movie before it ever came out go see it and form your own opinion it has lots of action never bogs down and the story moves quickly James is excellent as Piccolo of course being a big fan of his I would have like to see more of him but he is all the way through the movie in fact all the actors gave top notch performances James IS Piccolo just like he is Spike he has made this character his and what fun that is,Negative
The emoji movie is the next citizen Kane of movies it is brilliant and it is definitely is my favorite anime of all time The story goes as follows Gene the Meh emoji struggles to find his inner self I really really like this plot because it has not already been done  million times before also people say that this is a rip off of wreck it Ralph they are wrong this movie is much more emotional than wreck it Ralph and has much better scenes then Wreck it Ralph people also compare this to Pixars inside out of how similar the story is inside out is a piece of smiling emoji poop compared to this masterpiece I love the emoji movie and so should you,Negative

After watching the midnight premiere my friends and I came up with a theory behind Christopher Nolan and his Inception movie While he was making Inception Christopher Nolan needed more funding therefore he decided to make the Dark Knight Sadly Heath Ledger passed away but his death brought more fame and fortune than Nolan expected He was planning on reusing ALL actors in the Dark Knight but Christian Baile went on a dramaqueen rampage on set against the lighting director causing Nolan to lean towards DiCaprio as his lead This came about because Nolan happened to be sipping tea with Scorsese one lovely evening discussing Shutter Island and how fantastically adorable DiCaprio was in thrillers The Dark Knight was at best a side project because what Director Christopher Nolan REALLY had in mind was to F with our sense of reality through HIS thriller InceptionNo movie has ever caused me physical pain except this one i was cringing from suspense Every muscle in my body ached my lungs were collapsed and when i tried to stand up after the credits i just couldnt i just could not BREATHE my eyes still sting why because the entire movie my eyes were GLUED to the screen and i probably blinked oh lets say ZERO times driving back from the theater i lost my voice raving about the movie with my friends and Hans Zimmer i made my own Hollywood Star for him in the backyard the grass spell out his name i loved this movie Pick and pull at it all you want it was fantastic,Positive
Regarded as one of the great pictures ever like ever which is abysmal to me What does this movie offer especially since it is a watered down Michael Mann but instead of deeply interesting characters that showcase their battles outside of their work with isolation purpose and love how their lifestyle and profession is affecting themeselves psychologically you instead get a grizzled Batman and a cartoonish and idiotic Harvey Dent Obviously Ledger is tremendous as Joker but when he is not on screen the movie is almost unwatchable I will not even bring up the dumb things in the movie like how Joker tricked everyone in a hospital into him being a nurse because all he did was change his wardrobe and wore a nurses masks or when a  lb Joker held down  lb Batman who is a martial arts master or how the cop did not know the difference between a bazooka and a rocket launcherThat stuff is only small to the most significant flaw this movie makes me feel nothing,Positive
Dont care what the critics said the film is fine with the cast from original JP wat else can u demand moreThe franchise is too expensive to end there will be more in future and tat time I will bring my kids to watch to continue the legacyThe sad thing about this film is the soundtrack Welcome to Jurassic World doesnt played much in this finale it is a very powerful touching and touching music,Notr
I dont tend to write reviews but felt it necessary on this oneFirstly other than knowing  songs I knew nothing about the story for Cats I soon realised about  mins in that there is no solid storyline and perhaps it translates better on stage than the big screen However I loved it The performances were amazing I loved the dancing and J Hud was outstanding I was sobbing by the end Its just one bizarre musical number after anotherSecondly the CGI really isnt as awful as people are making it out to be Some bits looked a little off but it wasnt distracting at all In fact at times it was glorious to look at The set designs were beautiful and the way the actors moved was captivatingI can see why people may not like this movie its definitely not to everyones taste but its not a bad movie by the time you judge talent and direction I think its the lack of story that makes it hard to follow,Negative

Really good movie Sorry my review is too short really great movie,Negative
I dont think I have ever seen a movie that has gotten as much hype as this one I dont think even the  Batman got as much publicity Too much prehype can really hurt a film I give Snakes On A Plane as an example I saw it today and wanted to set down my observations Yes it is a good film with a lot of action I grew up watching the Adam West Batman light hearted and campy The title of this movie is accurate they do make him as a dark night who has almost as much inner torments and demons as the villains he pursues He has just not let the darkness overwhelm him Like everyone else I was saddened by Heath Ledgers tragic death and I think that might be one of the reasons for the raves about his performance people see it with their hearts instead of their heads The truth of the matter is that yes he does give a good turn as the Joker He brought his considerable talent to the role and truly made it his own However he did not for one moment make me forget Jack Nicholson That was one part Jack was born to play and Ledger was real gutsy to even try but he didnt come close Ledger was good but there is only one Jack Nicholson and he is the best Sorry Heath have fun in Heaven though,Positive

One interesting thing about this movie is how quickly it seems to pass  The movie could have continued this story for another  or  hours and I dont think it would have lost my interest  I think just because normal people like this movie is no reason to lower its rating with the movie critics The best movie ever  Definitely  Everything else pales in comparison,Positive
Utter rubbish In the first few minutes I already knew that this movie would disrespect and soil the Matrix legacy and frankly the last one really toed the lineGarbage plot garbage directing no Morpheus garbage effects Felt cheaply done What were they thinking This movie has no business bearing the The Matrix moniker The ending alone should have made someone stop and ask is this dumb af or is it just meBottom line We deserved better than thisKeanu if you read this I hope you know that Im still a huge fan Your acting was terrible but I forgive you,Notr
Until  its rating is  Looks like a really bad movie or anyone can call it a trash movie But for me its not really bad Maybe the point of this movie is to get the money from a lot of Dragonballs fan all around the world I bet everyone include my grandpa know what Dragonball is and my grandpa is really know about this manga its the truth If you watch it as a standalone movie and just forget about the adaptation word you will like this as some average American bmovie I love Dragonball very much and have complete all its anime and manga and I know this is a badadaptation I know too a lot of IMDb voter never watch this movie they just give  star just because of its cast choice The last thing is this movie still fail as a standalone because its story looks like rushing and really bad character development but everyone can still enjoy this as a fun movie I think they need some megabudget to make the Dragonballs world just like everyone dreamed for  is too low,Negative

I just came out of a movie theater I am very shocked by this movie Dark Knight was super incredible but it is amazing how a guy can produce another equally amazing master pieceStory acting directing are all rock solid Carrying such a complicated story can turn out to be a disaster but Christoper Nolan has a perfect control over the progress of storyHe plays the audiences mind in a high level and never fails to lose the composure and intensity of the story through the entire running time To that such an intense and emotional story he also inserted appropriate amt of humor to provide some relaxationsAll the CG is wisely used and provides jaw dropping experiencesActing wise Leonardo Diccaprio does what he does basically providing his overall great acting All the others are also superbly casted Especially the guy from  Summer is better than I expected He looks serious enough and does provide some funny momentsAgain I am very impressed with what Christoper Nolan pulled off In my opinion he is actually becoming one of those legendary directors such as Hitchcock Nolan got famous for stories dealing Humans psychology This is another those stories but in a gigantic scaleUsually many directors fail to produce good movies with a lot of money but this Christopher Nolan has no limitations he did that in Dark Knight and also in this movie InceptionI look forward to seeing his next possibly masterpiece film,Positive

Wow Words cannot describe what I have just seen It is sad to see that Hollywood as sank this low in creating a filmThe worst part wasnt the clich dialogue or the terrible comedy It wasnt the predictable and recycled plot The worst part about this movie is that at one point a group of executives sat together in a board room and thought Whats something hip and cool that kids like and they all collectively agreed that and EMOJI movie would be the best ideaAt one point I was in the middle of watching this and I came to the sad realization that I was watching a movie about EMOJIS Overall this movie was a sad attempt at trying to keep up with the times and I hope that this is a Hollywoods final attempt at trying to do something like this,Negative

Stephen King was surely pleased to see one of his works faithfully represented onscreen The director does an excellent job of showing the bleakness of prison life the frustration of a life gone awry and the misery of losing all one holds dear in life while somehow preserving the hope of better things to come Every actor was perfectly cast and the storyline draws to a perfect and satisfying close If you enjoyed the film youll love the book from whence it came Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,Positive
  maybe Im just a sucker for a legacy cast return a la Scream and SpiderMan No Way Home but if you can get past the rambling and frankly unnecessary first hour some bad acting from the majority of the cast Dern Wise Athie and Howard are the major exceptions and some not good and maybe even bad cinematography you will find a lot to enjoy in this sixth installment and end of a Jurassic era even with its flaws,Notr
I admit I had no idea of Morbius so was going in blind On finishing the movie I have no intention of finding out any more The film is slow and I mean slow The one hour forty four minutes felt like three hoursIt was mainly dark so not a lot could be seen the CGI was ok and most of action happened in the last third of the filmAlso having Milo the actually rather good Matt Smith calling out Michael rather a lot reminded me of The Lost BoysI was lucky that I hadnt paid full price for the cinema ticket as I seriously wouldnt waste my time,Notr

To wake up from a dream requires a major impact but sometimes you cant tell if its in a dream so you have the totem of a top But how do you know that the reality you are experiencing is not a dream The condition of waking up is to leave the world Dream dream in dream dream and reality are intricate The movie is more complicated but you can understand it if you watch it several times Its worth watching,Positive
Wow foiled again a movie from my youth gets a long awaited follow up it has a great cast with some familiar faces a big budget so theres action galore and some wonderful music but a plot a plot that could have been written by a random stranger walking past the studioHow on Earth is it possible for such a film to feel so vacuous so empty this film made me feel nothing other than boredom  that could have been used on so many other thingsIts not ok these days to simply try and dazzle us with some awesome visuals there needs to be some sort of plot but there just isnt one in simplistic terms it asks if man can live with dinosaurs but of course you know whats going to happen Some of the visuals are great epic some scenes thoughdid they run out of timeChris Pratt didnt do it for me the old cast tried but it felt hollowLike the dinosaurs themselves this franchise should have been left in the past ,Notr

"Inception is undoubtedly one of the most iconic science fiction films ever
It explains the idea of sharing a dream accessing and changing people s mind
It tells the story of Kobbthe proffesional thief and the master of his craft He enters the subconscious and steals the information that his clients need The only thing he regrets about is that he cant see his children anymore But one day he receives a deal that will change his life dramatically This operation seems to be infeasible but Kobb accepts to risk everything for his familyThe special effects are fantasticthe plot twists are unexpectable and wellthoughtout Inception is a clever and heartpounding thriller which leaves you with a strange felling that our life is an illusiona dream where everything is possible",Positive
I have seen this movie a few times Each time with the same hope and enthusiasm as before The main story is obviously Andys His fears his hopes and dreams his struggle to remain sane As a rock hammer Andy chisels the prison around him But this is more than the story of Andy and his way out of prison Its a tale of society men trying to survive trying to remain human and civilized Red is a gentleman masterfully played by on of the greatest actors ever His character adds depth to the story and makes room for hope for friendship All those around Andy benefit from his morals his intelligence his perseverance his will not to let go of himself At first we see men with no hope no way out of their walls Brooks is an unfortunate part of it But Andy changes lives Some study some begin to plan life outside the walls Even the guards look up to a man as righteous as they come Every time I see it I get the same warm feeling as the first time I saw it without actually knowing what it was what it is Its only fitting it sits on top of the charts and if that makes people watch it its just enough as it will bring them the same feeling again and again I movie to watch once a year or whenever you need a little pickmeup,Positive
Inception is a terrific mix of think and thoughtChristopher Nolan has made story paramount and beefed up as many action scenes as possible Somewhat neglected in that mix is the role of characterIf you loved The Matrix than this is for you in spadesBy using dream within a dream story lines we see the same people doing different things at the same time Its not all that challenging to keep track of four or five levels at a time especially if you accept the premise that time flows more rapidly the deeper you getFive minutes in real time is an hour on level one and the bottom level can consume a lifetimeFor me the fabulous sets and the intricacies of the dream structure had me riveted to the action But I did long for some character development a nuance that wasnt related to that persons dream storyThe choice of Ellen Page is particularly questionable She doesnt seem to have the depth of expression of even an ordinary actor and as one of only two women featured should be betterBut there are some fabulous effects Roped bodies moved as a weightless pile through corridors and elevators A falling bus on the second level that takes forever to hit the water into which it eventually plungesThe planting of seeds isnt some new concept The next time you thirst for a drink youve never tasted think advertising and youve come up with your own seedIf you ask why such a good rating with so many detractions well its really an andahalf and it is damn good at what it does,Positive

"Imagine watching commercials for  hours It would still be more entertaining than this movie

"Im embarrassed to say that I only just watched inception for the first time last week seeing as I have watched so many movies of all genres In my  years but Im glad I waited until seventeen to watch it because if I was younger I dont think I would have appreciated how amazing this film is Since I watched it a week ago not because I didnt get it the first time but because I could not believe how much I enjoyed it But I have seen a lot of people rate this film low because they didnt get it which is unfair because it doesnt mean its bad it just means it isnt pandering to everyone like most films do which results in them having dull plots
Some of the reasons this film is great include the acting the acting in this film is on point that includes all characters from cobb to Fischer there were no let downs Next the music Hans zimmer had once again created the perfect score which really captures the tone and the feel of the movie The music makes the action more exciting and brings a lot more passion to the more emotional scenes
Lastly the plot and script are intricately written giving us enough time with all characters will moving along the story The story is one that you will only come across every now and then a story which isnt obvious or overused This is original and amazing I recommend watching to everyone",Positive
Based on ratings by users I can see why this film is rated number  on IMDbA film about Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins who claims he was falsely imprisoned He decides to adjust to life while incarcerated and befriends a number of his fellow inmates including Ellis Boyd Redding Morgan Freeman Andy establishes respect among his cohorts and even the prison guards by doing a number of things in improving life in the prison including expanding a library and helping people do taxes The mens friendships grow over the years as try to find as the IMDb plot puts it solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency This movie is on the longer side being over two hours long However the many elements in this film do not drag making this movie an intriguing and exciting feature The plot and subplots were solid blending together well and the cast of characters gave a strong dramatic and memorable performance There were action humor drama tragedy and hope all mixed in providing you a very entertaining filmThere are far too many aspects of this film to be mentioned all at once in this review Therefore you will have to see and follow this movie for yourself to appreciate it It is certainly worthy of its seven Oscar nominations including Best Picture Forrest Gump won that year A mustsee for anybodyGrade A,Positive

This film is truely a masterpeice in unintentional horror The effects are so special Im going to have nightmares for weeks to come Why they didnt just dress the actors in costumes and makeup I have no idea either the filmmakers are lazy  or someone wanted to push the boundries of visual effects Cats pushes those effects right off a cliff into the uncanny valley The design and look is freakin disgustingI never saw the stage musical so I didnt know what I was in for This movie that has no plot its just a bunch of random cats introducing themselves I tried to enjoy it as a sobaditsgood cringefest but the lack of plot and the terrible effects make it impossibleIf you cant even look at the screen without feeling annoyed  disgusted its impossible to enjoy it in anywayThanks Tom Hooper,Negative

Ive lost count of the number of times It has to be one of the best movies ever made It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors beforeIs this the greatest film of all time IMDb would have you believe so Despite being a box office flop that barely recouped its budget the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting story and realism It has since been successful on cable television VHS DVD and BlurayAnd it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year Now twenty years old the film has not aged a day and instead seems to be getting better This is Tim Robbins best role and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan FreemanNot everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movieSomething that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action no special effects and no gimmicks  of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the endFor me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it no matter how many times I have seen it,Positive
The Emoji Movie is not just any bad movie but a stupid and incompetent one Ive seen worse but this movie is bad It doesnt even seem like a family friendly movie to me at all Illogical cringeworthy and just disgusting The Emoji Movie is one of the sorriest movies of all time and contains jokes inferior to literally any comedic family friendly movie,Negative
First of all This movie was made for fans of the series so if you arent one then obviously youre not going to enjoy this fairly campy adaption of an old anime series If we all remember that this movie IS indeed a kids film then you should obviously not expect great cinema but innocent fun which is exactly what the film isThe violence is fairly mild but very well choreographed the effects are subpar and the acting is laughable but I didnt mind all of that because this was a new interpretation of a series that I loved as a kid and all the core ideas and themes from the show are still hereIf you can suspend your disbelief and forget about certain large plot holes youll have a lot of fun with this movie If you cant do that then dont bother because make no mistake this is FAR from a good film,Negative
Ill be honest here I went into this movie with low expectations this is because I read some of the reviews about how rubbish it is and how its just a cash grab But now that I have seen it I can proudly say it was a good movie and ending to a franchiseBut I will say this there is so much plot holes in this film so if your going to see it just for the plot you will come out really disappointed Its a leave your brain at the door film Just enjoy it for what it is,Notr

"There is no denying that this is a very good movie The acting is great and it tells a good story Personally I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste but its far from a bad film On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes
This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie not because its a great one",Positive

Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so this film is a stepabove the standard summer blockbuster However the film also sits atop IMDbs top  films of alltime list a ranking that wont last nearly as long as its boxoffice rank Lines have been long to see this film and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are diehards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered Of course the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing cinematography art design and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere but when the non diehards begin to watch and vote well see this film settle into its rightful place somewhere in the top  of all time Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman  while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences Truly disturbing the characters were far from clich as one would expect from the genre No character is allgood or allbad Ledgers Joker comes close but earns a touch of sympathy None of the heroes are flawless which is a sign of any good film My single complaint besides the various hardtobelieve falls Batman survives is the rating This film is fartoo disturbing to garner a PG rating and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective yet another reason why this film is so good,Positive
This movie just sucks  plain and simple Why why why was it even made,Negative
This is by far my favourite of the trilogy andor any other Heath Ledger is so dark in this as the joker such an underrated potrayal everyones so excited about the new joker but Im just here standing by this one all the timeAs for batman in this movie Phenomenal Such a great performance never been much of a DC fan when it comes to batman that changesDefinitely recommend,Positive
Morbius was by no means any masterpiece It was pretty forgettable over all especially the action sequences which isnt a good sign for an action movie and throughout things just happened with no to very little build up and the few characters we had got very little in terms of development or explaining their relationships and then it just kinda ended without me being ready for itThat said I was never really bored in the theatre It was an interesting enough premise I understood the motivations and it kept a pretty straight line throughout None of these actors are gonna win any Oscars for their work on this movie but unlike some others I had no problem with any performance Over all an OK night at the theatre and I would rather rewatch this than anything DisneyMarvel had put out post Far from home except No Way Home and even that isnt super good IMO its just special to watch because of all the returning actors Try to pitch that movie but have every returning character from the other universes be played by different people youd end up with something properly stupid,Notr
Stunning VFX with an all star cast and amazing performance from Leo DiCap paired up with excellent writing and direction  a visual masterpieceThis film makes you dizzy but in a good way The story had a few what just happened moments but overall very thought provoking and entertainingThere were some plot and technical issues and the constant overbearing and annoying score was well annoying but the acting and visuals made it less painfulA  from me,Positive

I really advise the dragonball fans and even the ones who arent to NOT SEE this sort of movieI mean a sort of movie because this i cant rate this as a movie in respect to the movie industryWe all have reasons to be scared each time a live action movie sets to be released and this one is the perfect example of whyI dont even have words to describe what went wrong becausewell it all went wrongStoryline is a joke compared to our beloved anime series the cast did an awfull job it like they didnt want to be there and i can understand why the CGI was laughable to say the leastEven the DB Evolution writer came to apologize to the DB fans it doesnt give me back the wasted time but at least he recognized the crap that was done in the first placeI can only see this movie as a barrier to not cross for future references,Negative
When this movie was about to come out my friends were excited to see it but I was hesistant and didnt understand the hype at all It looked generic When we alll went to go see it in  it turned out to hit every cylinder I had and was in perfect alignment with every preference intellectual curiosity and personality need I had Its like it was made just for me and only meMultilayered plot extended and uncovered narrative core love story within a SciFi context character team dynamics that are fast paced and engaging visuals that will lure your attention and a depth of ideas that uncover a whole universe of possibiliy The exposition may be outlined more than subtle but it does keep the movie cohesive and streamlined Not a perfect movie in general but perfect for its own definitions Also a soundtrack to play for the next generation,Positive
For all the people out there who love MarvelDC super hero stories made into movies this film is for you You deserve it and youll love it as there are tons of plot holes filled with bad acting and dialogue You never have to ask why something happens as you dont careFor most of us we are interested in a unique and smart story telling experience for an origin series This doesnt happen often but when it does its nice to seeCant say much else Jared isnt entirely to blame as the script has him starting off on an offshore freighter for some reason and just gets more bizarre from there  star fanboys industry employees and bot farms will continue to prop up the dismal ratings and reviews,Notr

There was good VFX beautiful scenery and they didnt compromise to show dinosaurs but the story line was not up to the mark as it lacks good content and talking about thrill in jurassic Park movies should be must but this movies lacks in that too,Notr
This was a great movie The people who are giving low ratings and hating on this movie missed the whole concept A story had to be told to make the movie cohesive with what was comingPeople were impatient wanting immediate action instead of following the beginning storyline and were expecting a repeat of the prior sequelsTheres plenty of action if youre patient Understand that a great deal of time has passed and we watch the vulnerability and confusion Neo is dealing with a need to understand hes coming to grips with an environment foreign to his current understanding of reality memories and prior supper abilitiesBe patient enjoy the movie and pay attention to the smaller details,Notr

The movie theater was pretty full And about  minutes in it was full of sadness You could tell people were getting angry After about  minutes I couldnt hear the movie over the crying yelling and one guy was even howling Three older ladies beside me took out lighters and lite themselves on fire They just kept screaming Were free were free We all stormed to the front counter to get our money back Ans what do you know they just had cardboard cut outs of CATS sitting up front They were just toying with us So we did what any logical person would do we went out side and started punching cats,Negative
Look I am a fan of Chris Nolan or at least I used to be His movies are always different and I liked them Prestige was the first movie that I watched of him and I loved it The Dark Knight was the movie that I had the highest expectations and it did not let me down I know there are  things not to like The Dark Knight but for me there were  things to like But this time I AM disappointed Inception is like the cutest car that cant run very fast It has its good looking but no good plot and a million questions about the conceptThere are a few simple rules about a science fiction movie or story When you watch one there are things you feel right or not You can use your wildest imaginations but at some point they have to make sense This film certainly did not feel right This was like a low budget science fiction which starts well but loses it after a while except for this was a big budget movie Well there ARE a few things to like about this movie It has a good concept good graphics and good acting If the plat was better and a few more things made more sense this could have been the masterpiece everyone thinks it to be,Positive
I was lucky enough to see it in cinema i stole tickets from  grandma with her grand children The dialogue and story in this film is so great i considered suicide afterwards because i didnt feel i was worthy to see this godly motion picture commissioned by Allah himselfTbh i would rate this film a solid  those who say it is bad are just not smart enough to comprehend what is going on on the screen to say this is bad is to say that Allah doesnt guide us Only once in a millennium can god grace us with such a masterpiece if you havent seen this than you cannot say you have lived,Negative
Ok Cats is not everyones favourite musical It never has been and never will be but all those people scoring it just a one Come on people give credit where it is due Jennifer Hudson can sing but maybe her rendition of Memory this time round was not the best Idris Elba was spot on as McAvity and Taylor Swift linked up nicely with him for their number But the showstopper was Skimbleshanks making it a tap dance worked so well and the whole dance crew joined in to make this a memorable routine And I quite liked James Cordens number visually it worked beautifullyOK the sets were not great but I have yet to see a production of Cats where it has been good Its just that type of show And Francesca Hayward was charming and beautiful to watch throughout Nobody seemed to notice these things Its still worth watching and with a cast like this yes definitely,Negative
First off if Marvel wants a vampire movie that badly then focus on Blade If Morbius had stuck to being a vampire movie I might have given it a higher rating Dont get me wrong I love a good vampire movie but sadly the more I watched all I saw was cheap knockoffs of Dracula Untold and the ultimate vampire movie The Lost Boys Some scenes were damn near identical The ONLY thing I liked was Morbiuss black trench coat with the purple silk lining That being said the end credit scenes were pretty cool and if you watch it on a streaming network I recommend skipping the entire movie and just watch those instead,Notr

Amazing Every time I watch Inception I find something new This is a stunning scifi film with lots of suspense and plot twists The action begins in the first minute of the film and keeps you captivated until the end I was absolutely blown away the first time I watched this film and every time since This is a film about a man named Cobb Leonardo DiCaprio and a team of people who are tasked with invading Robert Fischers Cillian Murphy consciousness through his dreams The physiologically thrilling story is perhaps Christopher Nolans greatest film and will amaze you The sensational story stunning visuals amazing effects and mindblowing ideas make Inception a mustsee It truly amazes me how anyone could come up with a story as unique and compelling as this,Positive

Should you watch this if youre a adult alone no Should you watch this whit children yes for kids at the age form  to  this is a enjoyable movie I was very skeptical about this movie because of the reviews i watched it today whit two young children and the enjoyed it Watching this movie whit them made this movie a lot better The animation was good the pasting was ke it was very colorful almost neon a clear sign that this movie is for very small children The story is simple easy to follow for kids Is this a animation masterpiece no it is not inside out its not Up Its just a movie for very small children,Negative
Oh come on nd best movie ever I dont think so  Its unrealistic and overly sentimental the people who voted so high cant have seen many films By all means watch it but Papillion for example is far superior who can forget Steve McQueens red rimmed eyes and pasty face as he catches bugs and crushes centipedes into his watery broth to get nourishment in that incredible portrayal of hardship and determination  I wouldnt put Papillion as the nd best film of all time but it has to be the best Prison drama  Watch Shawshank and youll enjoy it as a lightweight entertaining feel good movie but there are so many classic films better than this,Positive

I just recently saw this film and to say the least I am impressed Christopher Nolan has done what many people cant seem to do these days which is to come up with an original idea and make it a great film If you can make it through a movie while being slightly confused this is a movie for you It is full of action science fiction and mind boggling storyline It is a great film and a must see Leonardo De Caprio rocked his performance along with Jason Gordon Levitt and Ellen page This movie also has humor in it which is unexpected but put in very good timing Christopher Nolan has outdone himself and makes The Dark Knight look amateurish So get in line buy the ticket and watch this movie as many times as you can IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT,Positive
"As I write this review Morbius has a  rating on IMDb I definitely think thats way too low If youre a big fan of the MCU then be sure to watch this movie Yeah facts are really good But the plot twist is pretty generic what does a good guy do when he gets powers that make him a bad guy Theres not a lot of originality as the answer that question but the movie isnt bad Just understand that it is almost  origin story so dont expect a big complex plot or narrative I like the two leads especially the bad guy  but who IS the bad guy  
Not sure if the movie did well enough that well see a sequel but this character deserves to be given another story so that we see him become Morbius",Notr

I loved it They didnt STRAY much at all from the original Its just cats dancing song after song Of course there is really no plot there never was I found the imagery to be neat and odd I honestly think they took a big risk releasing something like this to the general audience They could have changed it to make it appeal to the masses which would have yielded a better profit and review But Im personally glad they stayed true to what it is,Negative
Visually interesting and innovative yet pretentious It has an excellent cast with great performances The complexity of its story works perfectly in the way of confusing us Its easy to think that something that we dont fully understand is great Its easy to see how so many people liked the film so much There are plenty of alleged subtleties and symbols which the fans are so eager to comment Everyone can write a script that is complex It only needs not be completely logicI prefer a narrative that is simple but at the same time thick This is harder to doFar from being a masterpiece extremely overrated,Positive

I gave this movie a shot despite hearing bad things about it and it was the let down I heard about I think the main criticism I can give this movie is that its just boring the movie isnt long but it just seems to drag the action is there but its not great and the story just seems to drag and is a utter mess Even with Matt Smith someone who I like even he couldnt shine in this movie Unfortunately its not a great movie and its disappointing what sony is doing with the SpiderMan universe although I liked the Venom movies this just isnt good I was intrigued that they brought Adrian Toomes in the credit scene well see what that brings,Notr

Although an average film Batman Begins had a dark brooding quality and got off to an interesting start about the origins of the caped crusader before turning dreary Unfortunately this followup takes up right where the previous one left off  still dark but also dreary and even sillier The script is atrocious and the plot line involving TwoFace is unbelievably lame The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger He is simply fun to watch as the Joker All the other actors look bored a result of Nolans dull direction At a length of two and a half hours it seriously overstays its welcome Time to make Batman Ends,Positive
I took my little sister to see this movie and my mother and I were uninterested from the start I didnt like the music It didnt make me laugh The graphics looked so weird on the actors its was distracting My mother was ready to leave before the movie ended It was just a terrible movie all together,Negative
Morbius lacked so much depth and practically fought for its life just to have some The dynamics between Jared Letos Morbius and Matt Smiths Milo was just boring and unnecessary To be honest though most of the movie was unnecessary It was a cool idea but it was boring and aside from a few cool scenes its completely forgettable Theres so much to keep up with and so much that doesnt make sense so its just killing itself from scene to scene The after credits were rough and let in some pretty big potholes The fight scenes are messy and while creative definitely not outstanding And the character deaths that were included to make the story more interesting were stupid and angering This entire movie was just a mess If there ever is a second one theres gonna be quite a bit to clean up,Notr
Christopher Nolans name is an assurance of high quality Never misses a beat This film is intricate  should be viewed multiple times It is meant to make you think about the wonders of an idea,Positive
Lots of dinosaurs action and explosions It felt like quite a long couple of hours I thought is was an OK movie and contained all the Jurassic sequel elements youd expect but that was about it I feel pretty bad leaving this as a review considering there was obviously no expense spared in the making of this film and the cast that was put together to bring it to the big screen But in short it was just OK not one Ill be looking out for when it if released onto streaming channels,Notr
This movie is excellent in every way you look at it Even the ways you dont know about it is excellent  Every time I think about this movie it makes me want to watch it again Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give one heck of a performance A brilliant masterpiece to show how cruel the system was and how they can take away your freedom with flimsy evidence It was back in the s its probably the best justice system they had  And how cruel the prison system was back in the day nd all time favorite move st being Platoon,Positive
Movie provides a new metanarrative that unravels a new type of story telling  something new You have to watch M multiple times to understand the story I agree it was not heavily martialartsoriented but had more emotionalvibrational fights Great movie,Notr
Cant think of any positives A blemish on the actors CV Laughable CGI and effects,Negative
Overall I believe the movie creatively summed up the moral of be yourself This is an important lesson and was portrayed throughout This is evident in the trailer so this is not a spoilerI thought it was OK The animation was quite good and there was some relatable and creative moments which I think was the only thing this movie had going for it There was also some cheeky product placement which was very obvious however there were some funny relatable smart phone moments not going into too much detail that did make me chuckle NOT laugh big differenceThis movie is basically your clich animated kids movie it has some humor that is slightly funny a villain and an end goal I predicted the ending within the first  minutes of watching the film I was right There were so many opportunites missed with this film but I am surprised at the  average rating I would have given it a bit more then that Overall I do not recommend this movie and rather suggest you spend your money on one of the better movies out right now cough cough Dunkirk,Negative
Bravo finally this truly was a quality film the acting directing and writing this film is like something youve never seen from a superhero  comic book adaptation filmsLet me start with the acting Heath ledger everything has already been said about this performance yet he still managed to surprise me what a performance hats off he really does get under your skin created togather with writers of course the perfect joker or at least the one i wanted to see dark psychotic and a maniac Aaron Arkhat or however you spell his name also gave a strong performance as Hearvy Dent and the other cast was pretty solidThe script is just great this is truly one of the best films if not the best that portrait the battle between good and evil between what right and wrong and about making the right choicesNow retrospectively i am really disappointed with the trailers for this movie they composed different sentences to give it a more intense feeling and gave a lot of the action in the movie sure they were great but also gives you high expectations for this movie and i hate coming to a movie with high expectations so a little let down in that aspect and yes  hours and a half did feel a bit longThat been said TDK is a fantastic movie sure it has some flaws but what movie doesnt its well written directed and acted action packed and even epic in a way only time will make itOverall this is a MUST SEE movie for anyone that has a little sympathy for movies,Positive
First of all I love Pratt and Neill and the rest of the cast but they need a good story line Dominion does not that Very weak and one bizarre scene after another see Maverick instead if you are seeking sentiment SKIP,Notr
Like many of the reviewers I hate prison movies with all the clichs and stereotypes of innocent prisoners nasty guards and evil wardens and upon first viewing many years ago I especially disliked being forced by this film to feel sympathy and empathy with murderers rapists and the likeShawshank has somehow transcended the test of time and I believe that it has endured not because of the great performances which dont seem to be acting at all but real not because of the simple but multilevel story line with its twists and turns not because of its magnificent photography not because of its score and not because of any individual element that went into the making of this film Hence the lack of academy awards However when all those elements are combined Shawshank becomes one of those masterpieces which is greater than the sum of its partsand this film is so much greater that in the desperation of its characters it invokes a multitude of good emotions in the viewerthat there is divine poetic justice and hope in this hell of a worldShawshank has become my favorite film of all time but it took a while When yourre feeling down and out watch Shawshank Raising my vote from  to  however subjective that vote may be,Positive

Rewatchability  ReviewBeing IMDbs highest rated movie The Shawshank Redemption is often considered one of the greatest films of all timeand for good reason As a longtime fan I can confirm it truly lives up to the praise Everything from the story themes and character development to the cinematography editing and soundtrack is masterfully doneAndy and Reds character arcs along with the overarching theme of hope have always stood out to me The film captures the hopelessness of Shawshank Prison perfectly with nearly every scene serving a purpose and executed with exceptional careOverall theres not much more to sayThe Shawshank Redemption really is that good For anyone who enjoys prison dramas or wellwritten films in general I highly recommend this film If anything the pacing may feel a little slow at times but I believe this is about as close to a perfect movie as were likely to getFinal Rating ",Positive
"There isnt anything bad i can think about this film Brilliant  its a must see during the pandemic stay safe
tdotpics",Positive
It permanently made me go from casual movie watcher to cinefile over one watch Please watch this Maybe the best movie of the century Concerning my good,Positive
This is an insult to my intelligence of electronics and common logic If I have to even read the word Emoji again I am probably going to go throw someones smartphone into the trash This movie is so bad it gave me several brain tumors from trying to process all of the cancer this movie gave This movie had so many product placements it made my brain cry If you like your kids and your selfrespect do not watch this horrible movie You shouldnt even torrent it,Negative
The best thing I can really say about this movie is that isnt as bad as the previous one Its just a passable action flick with a pretty weak story and an uneven pace,Notr
One of my favorite movies everThe Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes placeBased on a Stephen King novelthis movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic filmTim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd Red Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despiseThis film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this factIt was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Actor  Morgan Freeman Best Adapted Screenplay Best Cinematography Best Editing Best Original Score and Best Sound but didnt win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest GumpI personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his careerBravo to this brilliant modern day classic,Positive
Most of the people who rated this movie  out of  either saw the Bootleg or didnt even see the movie Dont listen to them Yes there right about it being very different But who wants to see the some old thing NOT me The movie was a little rushed yea but thats because they want to get the DRAGONBALL story over with so that they can start with DRAGONBALL Z This is basically all of the main characters background story or how they all met Thats ALL it is Its like an intro to the sequelsPersonally I thought it was great Even though it was rushed it was still a fun cool and very entertaining moviefor your information its a family movie This movie is more directed towards young kids and they will LOVE this movie,Negative
"Normally I break down my reviews into good and bad sections So lets start with the goodGood
Short runtime  minutes This film respects your time and wraps up its awfulness in relatively short orderBad
Acting The Goku actor feel pulled out of a bad CW high school drama None of the actors feel engaged or like they want to be involved with this messScript Truly awful writing muddled concept doesnt have any idea at all what its even trying to say or doHigh School drama Why is an anime about otherworld martial artists posing as a high school drama movie in the first placeAction  Terrible martial arts terrible CG power effectsIts trying to play itself so seriously as well that you cant even say its a fun romp  camp type movie it just doesnt workI cant even speak to the lore  accuracy as I wasnt a huge dragonball fan going in though I have it on good authority that the accuracy is on par with the rest of the awful qualities of the film",Negative
An analysis of prison lifeand of what hope can be in a prisonFrank Darabonts first film is one of the best ever  Wellwritten and wellacted the story of the development of friendship between Red and Andy is charming endearing poignant  Nothing about this movie is overwrought or extraneousits simply extraordinary drama,Positive
I still cant quite get the enormous reputation of this film I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery the mystery got thicker It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman James Whitmore etc butthe most highly rated film ever I dont get it The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film I love Morgan Freemans voice but hes telling us what were seeing So the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never really arrives The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbinss psychological journey Credible or incredible doesnt quite matter I did go with him without asking too many questions Morgan Freemans humanity is contagious and inspiring whether credible or not because I bought it So a masterpiece No Good even very good Yes,Positive
What the actual hell This is only gonna be targeted for younger audience This is the worst movie of all time No joking Cringe Cringe Cringe I dont care what anyone thinks This movie is as bad as drinking while driving,Negative
Convolutedjust too convoluted and complicatedInterstellar is a beautiful film but this  is an incoherent jumble and muddle of ideas and concepts Though theyd have been theoretically very interesting and thought provoking if manageably usedIts basic premise is intriguing and thought provoking but I was annoyed and eventually bored by its overambitious and confused plotPeople who liked it must be very patient willing andor able to make sense of it much better than I do though I dont consider myself unintelligentFilms like this make me thinkare people too shy or lazy to post reviewsratings that go against the majority Because I cannot believe that the majority of the general population could reasonably follow the plot of this filmThough it has been years and I will give it another watch to try and make better sense of it,Positive
Read the films ranked below Inception in the top and weep Have people lost their critical faculties Yes Inception is clever multilayered complex and intellectually challenging It is also heartless It struggles to stimulate emotion Cleverness replaces impact Di Caprios onedimensional acting reinforces this sterility From the first shot of a grim face we get the whole range of grim faces in a grim performance He is grim about his kids grim about the folding graphics grim about his team grim about the task in hand Of the Matrix plus effect I did like the folding city but the ending was portentous to the point of tedium One very good litmus test of the quality of a film is to analyse how many times the main protagonists have to explain the plot and at what length they have to explain it Several characters explain the rules of the dream within a dream within a dream construct at the heart of the movie with increasing loquaciousness and qualifications This isnt plotting and it fails to create a genuine narrative drive Compare it to so many of the films that come below this one in the rankings Twelve Angry Men Seven Samurai Goodfellas Casablanca Once upon a time in America Citizen Kane for goodness sake Dont even mention films like Shawshank and the Godfather which rank above it This is a good film possibly one of the better films of the year It is a very long way from a great one,Positive
when I gave my opinion with  marks I was not give it for the movie or for Christian Bale or for director but only for Heath Ledger who made A wonderful performancehe was able to delve deeper into this character really with loud voice and A great honor I want to say BRAVOOOOOOO But in general the story was amazing especially in last minutesand as always Morgan Freeman Was scintillating and Maggie Gyllenhaal also finally I believe that without Heath Ledger and his performance this movie was not take more than  because he was the secret of success thanks Heath Ledger and we will not forget you and your fantastic performance,Positive
Well not as bad as the ratings and reviews shown here It was pretty enjoying to me I just wished the main conflict was not about how an emoji should be because emoji was just an emoji It has to be smile emoji meh emoji etc and not a multitalented emoji You know like Monster Inc movie where one of the main conflicts was about who could scare kids the most,Negative
I saw the movie with not too much expectations I am one of the skeptics but for a moment there i kept a certain positivism toward the movieThe movie Is an embarrassment to the manga  the anime  the fans and above all to Akira Toriyama When I think that the budget for that movie was of  Million im confused of the resultSpecial effects are OK theyre not AMAZING theyre just OK  Acting seems out of place at so many parts Parts that are supposed to be taken out are not you can not deny how bad the script was  I mean Potentially Changing the original story that much i was OK with it because DBFranchise is very airy so you can revamp characters and situations However The way the story was presented SUCKED BIG TIME Its Amazing Cheeziness for   But then again thats James Wong for you Im not really against the actors and their fitting they couldve fit if there was a better directing WE DO NOT WANT PART II TO BE RUINED BY WONG  MICHAEL BAYBRYAN SINGER ALL THE WAY,Negative
The first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption I was only  At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion As I have grown my taste in movies has also Still I rank Shawshank as my favorite film the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life If you have not seen this film I pity you Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster I implore you step away from your computer go out to the nearest store and buy this movie Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person So if you are yet to see this film you must in the words of Andy Get busy livin or get busy dyin,Positive
Is it great No Can you be entertained while watching it Absolutely Know what you are going into  this is no where near the caliber of the first one or any blockbuster hit for that matter but if you go in with the mindset that This will not be good you will enjoy yourself,Notr
This movie was an emojinal rollercoaster The pathos derived from its intense moments was indescribibile What were these moments exactly Well while watching the movie I noticed my retractable dildo had fallen off the shelf and knocked a lamp off starting a fire in the house I began getting hot in my seat thinking this was some emotional work from the movie Alas I reluctantly unglued my eyes from the screen and looked behind me and everything was fine Apparently my doctor told me later I was off my medications as well as abusing an unprescribed dose of LSD Now that Im better and on my medications I can wholeheartedly say that this movie was a masterpiece,Negative
This move is amazing from all the side plots to the mysteries it has it all well shot a great cast and is the best movie I have ever seen feels so real and doesnt feel like it lacks anything and has multiple amazing plot twists and shows  different paths meet at the end at the same place both in peace,Positive
Overall I felt that this movie definitely wasnt bad Maybe it was kind of a coy to advertise different mobile apps to young children but I watch this when it first came out and I surprisingly enjoyed it Definitely deserves at least a  Great comedy and plot lines In this show For its purpose an overall great film  ,Negative
Its not down right awful just mehFor starters yes this movie is not good Awful story followed by awful characters The movie is always being dumb or stupid every  seconds that you cant help but laugh at how badly this can getThey also never use the concept of a phone great A fire wall as an actual Fire Wall Where does that fitI dont hate it its still watchable for the first mins before it starts becoming unbearable Adding in a forced romance Not every movie needs the main character falling in love with the girl characterYes its bad to meh But not as bad as some say but still not good  Very Cringy and Corny,Negative
Rated  stars a fabulous movie full of fun tension good story  you can actually feel for the emojis as the story progresses Excellent Characterization Scripting and superb Animation This is a fun watch and can be watched repeatedly,Negative
My name is Nicholas Toste and when I went to watch this movie masterpiece for the first time I came in expecting the worst I was pleasantly surprised to find this excellent piece of cinema not only is nearly a shot for shot remake of the anime but it in fact surpasses the source material A truly amazing experience I highly highly highly recommend If you dislike this review Ill shut up,Negative
Havent seen it havent put a score but just clicked on all  reviews and what a surprise that the only review those users have ever written are of this movie Ill just leave it at that Those reviews are obviously too shallow to be credible but its just sad,Notr
This movie is not The Matrix This movie is very similar to The Last Jedi The used the same title They used some of the same characters the soundtrack is completely different the score is completely different the color pallet is completely different the timing is completely different the pacing is completely different  the cinematography is completely different there is virtually zero martial arts choreography  It is a completely different movie and you can feel it as soon as the opening credits end,Notr
Its a very soft  but its a  for meDirected by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan Jonathan Nolan and David S Goyer  these guys are in their primes here Not that the same isnt true of some of the actors involved in this film Heath Ledger and Aaron EckhartIts hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history He is played to perfection Perfect would even be putting it mildly Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too littleChristian Bale Michael Caine Maggie Gyllenhaal and Gary Oldman are all super but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character Harvey DentTwo Face Christopher Nolans hidden ace A perfect addition to the films storyThe action scenes are OK the sound is good the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre but the acting the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight  the giant that it isI recommend it along with the other two installments in the series Batman Begins  and the notsogood The Dark Knight Rises Final score ,Positive
This film is a truly awesome film once i had started watching the first  minutes of it i was addicted to the TV and could do nothing but to watch it This story is about a respectable banker Andy Duframe who is sentenced to Shawshank prison for life imprisonment for a crime he did not commit Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn that the prison mentally takes your life However Andy seems very unusual being very quite and polite around the prison At the spectacular climax at the end of this film it just gives the viewer such an amazing feeling of hope and in my opinion this is the best film every made A must watch film ,Positive
Lots of cgi as usual with creatures chasing people as usual but they seem to have spent more time focusing on the female action girl quota than they did on any story Oh the acting is poor and unconvincing too Just watch some David Attenborough stuff instead,Notr
Reel Tunez Movie Review  Jurassic Park DominionNot the best J P Not the worst J P But it does bring both the initial three and most recent two Jurassic Parks together and wraps up the seriesIts cool bringing the original cast back together and bringing them into the new Jurassic Park worldAt about   hours it runs long and is full of actions screams and loudness Its a fun popcorn movie and the effect look good though not further improved from the last two Its worth seeing on the big screenIt does seem like they really chopped it at the last minute almost haphazardly as a blonde villain character was on the scene made a big presence than just seemed to vanishId give it about a  out of  Certainly worth seeing but also it probably wont be the best movie or even top  you see this year,Notr
I feel regret of seeing this film latelyThis movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible directionIf credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first rowHis performance was never before and never aftercoming to batmanbale is as usually outstandingChristopher Nolan handled the story with some emotionssome action in perfect wayHe is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspectsThis is master piece of Nolans artI am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes onheath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the jokerif u still havent seen this moviethen what the hell are you waiting for,Positive
Everyone did their job well except the script writersThe movie is missing a soulWas it supposed to be a super hero movieAll these references to today to make the audience feel connected cringeAnd the ending dear Gods Did they imply they might pull another one,Notr
What a steaming hot pile of garbage this was I feel so bad for the actors whose reputation was tarnished To the actors who watched and read the source material to understand the role only to be shown the garbage script The director should be sued and made to pay the actors who lost roles and money because of this inability to do anything Just make a movie without dragging a anime by using its name and characters Do not watch this as youll waste valuable minutes of your life,Negative
The main character is not interesting the story is not interesting the entire movie is not interesting its just a cashgrab The only people who like this movie are uneducated toddlers who dont know what a good movie is And just like what the title says I will NEVER recover from the utter garbage that is The Emoji Movie its so bad that I didnt even watch the full movie its that bad I never thought a movie could be this bad I started this movie thinking its not THAT bad but it is just horrible I will never emotionally recover nothing about this movie is good an any one I watched part of this nightmare so you dont have to I sacrificed my faith in humanity so nobody has to watch this movie,Negative
The Dark Knight is not just the greatest comic book movie of all time but also director Christopher Nolan best film Nolan gets all time performance from not just his hero but also the villain Christian Bale and Heath Ledger with Ledger stealing the show Bale again brilliantly personifies all the deep traumas and misgivings of Batmans alter ego Bruce Wayne yet Ledger comes away with some how an even better performance A bit of Hamlet is in this Batman The film from start to finish is enthralling fullbodied crime epic of gratifying scope and moral complexity this is seriously brainy pop entertainment that satisfies every expectation raised by its hit predecessor and then some  out of  no notes,Positive
Sorry to pile on but in my  years I have never walked out of a movie until now We had high hopes we love musicals but good lord this was awful on every level,Negative
I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption Shawshank encompasses friendships hardships hopes and dreams  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you it gives you hope  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different you dont feel that far removed from what the characters are going throughIt is a simple film yet it has an everlasting message  Frank Darabont didnt need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film the narration and the acting does that for him  Why this movie didnt win all seven Oscars is beyond me but dont let that sway you to not see this film let its ranking on the IMDbs top  list sway you let your friends recommendation about the movie sway youSet aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie,Positive
This movie is great but not one of the best ever its really overrated imoWith Ledgers Joker this wouldnt be as greatly reviewed as it is,Positive
This movie is garbage Dont watch it I took my little sibling to see this I was forced to and Im very glad with what I saw a horrible movie I wanted this movie to fail simply because of how dumb the idea is and how cringe worthy it is Right now it feels like Christmas for me The movie is so bland and generic and cheesy and illogical seriously they bombed See Sony this is karma for screwing over SpiderMan and all relating characters for the past few years Next time stick with a Popeye movieNow this review Is just my rant about how much I wanted it to fail But if I were to put a REAL review in itd be this This is one of the most clich movies of all time Its like Sony looked at things like Wreck it Ralph and Finding Dory and just straight up copied it But made it worse The characters are bland the story is bland and all the comedy fails STAY AWAY FROM THIS MESSAnd Patrick Stewart what are you doing here in this mess Youre better than this man Cmon Poop Really,Negative
I thought it was a nice movie and really enjoyed it Glad I did not pay attention to negative reviews I frankly dont get what everyone is complaining about its a childrens movie Furthermore the story is very innovative and creative It is not claiming to be James bond Startrek or something it is not Its a movie where character are EmojiesThose who did not like this film have lost touch with their inner child Very sad,Negative
It is one of the best movies Oh yeah then I remind myself of The Dark Knight I chose to give Inception   because giving it  will be equating it with The Dark KnightNolans movies arent for those with low concentration power You need to be in the movie in order to keep pace with story It is almost like studying for an exam And this one is the toughest of them allThe best thing apart from good acting from all those involved is great script It does not give you any chance to sit back and relax You are pulled inside the movie The pace at which the movie goes is enjoyable to watchThe important fact about this movie is that there is no stand out character like the Joker Each character has been given equal importance and as a whole have done a splendid jobChristopher Nolan has taken great risk in making this movie He is banking upon the audiences to be intelligent enough to enjoy the movie You might hear reviews from friends saying that the movie is crap I heard it myself but let me tell you that it is a must watch If you are the kind of movie buff who likes to see movie as an art and not just for actors and actions and other secondary thingsIf you are going to watch this movie make sure you go when you have nothing on your mind because you will need to focus on the movie,Positive
Dont watch it youll waste your life Watch Spiderverse instead,Negative
Decent plo great cast and good performances but not enough to merit this being anything above average for me as an animated movieConcept is cool and relatable for the overall family Its coherent and does entertains at the level its supposed toI dont agree with the very low ratings but dont see this being an amazing or needle mover A great fun time if you wanna laugh and enjoy a witty comical creative movieEasy to relate to with good characters that offer humour and motivationIf you see this on tv definitely watch it It just may not be worth the price of renting lolEnjoy,Negative
Watching Inception with its futuristic emphasis on getting inside peoples heads through dreams especially hearing Leonardo DiCaprio explain the pitfalls to newbie Ellen Page I couldnt help thinking about Forbidden Planet and that warning about monsters from the Id Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could notChristopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times it still is an unmistakable masterpiece Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and hes essentially a cat burglar of the mind His mission usually is to invade peoples dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent But Leos also a wanted manSome problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate Cillian Murphy Its not to steal anything but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on othersVery nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolans dialog with verve and conviction I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought,Positive
"Everybody should watch this movie
I laughed
I cried Just because of all that laughter
I feeled with the CharactersThis movie is just great
Could easily be better than Find NemoNo I am not getting paid for thisThe movie is just good",Negative
I doubt anyone expected this movie to be Citizen Kane but I have to say it at least didnt put me to sleep Unlike Citizen KaneThe premise of creating a film around emojis is extremely thin however the result is suprisingly fun with some very good casting choices such as Tim Miller The moral of the story is a bit of a miss but I doubt this was the reason most people saw thisIt also goes to show that Patrick Stewart is up for a laugh by allowing himself to be cast as the poop emoji by far the most unique role hes ever taken onOverall its great mindless fun for people of all ages and well worth at least one viewing,Negative
I watch bad movies as a hobby and this is among the worst movies Ive ever seen There is literally no story People were walking out Tom Hooper is the name Alan smithee uses when even hes embarrassed to put a name on his picture One of the worst movies of the decade  million dollars for that Imagine how many poor children you could feed,Negative
Insulting piece of garbage Only simularity between this movie and the true dragon ball series are the names and nothing else,Negative
Didnt even watch it tbh Watched the trailer and heard reviews tho ,Negative

Be checking it out my fellow millennials This movie is so hashtagRELATABLE All the kids these days are constantly using the machines so the HIP COOL SWAG people at Sony made a AWESOME movie about those devices those kids these days are constantly on In this movie all the kewl kids use the cellular devices to communicate with their peers One young man starts telegramming his crush with these mobile phone hieroglyphics that the youths refer to as emojis Suddenly we all get to learn how that technology really works In my day we had a rotary phone that took  minutes just to dial AND WE LIKED IT But these days the childrens have an entire city called Textopolis in those dang devices Sony seems to really be in touch with the youths of today with all the edgyyy relatable jokes and puns in this movie,Negative
We watched it and enjoyed it It is a sixth installment Those are usually terrible and enjoyed mostly by people who enjoy repetitiveness We didnt get that vibe here It felt like closing the circle with the iconic first movie Perhaps people keep expecting another experience like in  but thats impossible because that was the only time we were able to be vowed by a very first seemingly realistic look at dinosaurs It was mind blowing But that can never be recreatedOf course this installment has no unexpected plot If it did THAT would actually kill the vibe This movie is based on nostalgia on the joy of getting the old trio of Laura Dern Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum back together and them meeting the Jurassic World leadsWe were very pleasantly surprised and liked  better than  and  Or even  and  They did fine with this,Notr
The only thing that remotely saved this terrible excuse of a movie was the wonderful animation The movie was so bad they brought in all these bell ringers Taylor Swift James Cordan but yet they can hardly sing at all Poor excuse of a movie The only good song was Mr Mistoffelees Save yourself the time and watch Sheep and Wolves,Negative
This film is bold and for that Ive given it bonus points Its part romance part violence and quite a bit of fillerThe film reminds me of a art house project with a big budget It feels fragmented as it switches between a romancedrama and hardcore action flick I found myself being bored by the characters  not caring about them or their plight They added nothing to the storyIf I had to describe what was fun it was revisiting the first Matrix film it was seeing a fan fiction film made by a wachowsky It was seeing Neo and Trinity engaging each other I also enjoyed Neil Patrick Harris with some of his dialogue  he was spot on at timesOverall its an OK film Its too different from the original It lacks thought provoking The action scenes feel flat The characters dont do much The motives are not strongId give it a go Support the gamble taken in making this film its genuinely different Just think romance with martial arts and it might helpContains at least one graphic scene Not recommended for squirmish teens,Notr
Actually quite a typical superhero movie with a stereotyped plot that wasnt as bad as the reviews and ratings suggested Didnt expected much but the CG and actions were decent the acting wasnt bad as well and I found this rather enjoyable Though the story is quite similar to other superhero movies this is honestly better than venom and the batman and even some mcu garbage like black panther and shangchi that gets a ridiculously high phony rating Fairly speaking this should worth a  which the rating again wrongly reflect on like most of the movies as a lot the raters and critics are just a bunch of pretentious kids without much sense,Notr
Im convinced Heath Ledger was insane and was a reallife psychopath Theres just no way he could put off a performance like that being sane of mind The fear his character introduced in me could not be matched Its intensity wowThe plot is amazing perfectly scripted by Nolan all connected amazing The torture that the Joker creates is perfectly executedThe messages the movie creates are amazing how we can save everybody The ending is wow just wow a great culmination to a masterful filmAnd some parts of the movies will just stay in my mind forever for how iconic it is All the action sequences the interrogation All awesomeMy top  movies of all time,Positive
The Dark Knight  is a monumental achievement in superhero cinema transcending the genre to tell a gripping morally complex story that goes far beyond the origins of the comic book Directed by Christopher Nolan the film is not just a sequel to Batman Begins but a cinematic masterpiece in its own rightNolans direction is masterful interweaving intricate storylines with breathtaking action sequences and moments of profound introspection The films visual palette is dark and gritty and perfectly captures the menacing atmosphere of Gotham CityThe Dark Knight is not just a superhero film but a cinematic epic that transcends the boundaries of its genre With its unforgettable cast gripping story and thematic depth it remains a timeless classic that has captivated audiences worldwide,Positive
"This movie could have been way better it had a great potential Im not gonna talk about the negative side of this movieLets talk about the good stuff
This movie has a great visual effect great motion perfect timing for the slow motion and the accelerated motion the colors everything But what really shocked me was the closing credits or end credits list of the cast and crew of a particular motion picture not the post credit scenes the visual effects in those closing credits were AMAZING I cant express how much an amazing experience those closing credits were for the first time in my life I didnt want them to endFinally the post credit scene not to spoil anything Im just gonna say they were great opening the door for something special",Notr
I expected the worse movie ever The ending is not very satisfactory and post credit scenes are as lame as they can be However I must say I didnt get bored and it is a good movie if that is what youre looking forThe acting is ok the effects are a little lame and there are actions scenes where you dont know what the hell is going on But again I wasnt expecting a master piece and it is just fine compared with some Marvel movies The female lead is a highlight and Leto does a good job Certainly it can be better but it is not the horrible film that some critics make it out to be At least it is not boring and that is  of the goal of superhero movie,Notr
I love the Jurassic Park franchise and this had good moments but the story was a bit flat The original characters were great to see together again and their little personal moments were fantastic but the dinosaurs were almost secondary It was almost like it was about the young girlThe original Jurassic Park had science fiction but it was really believable and the story was fantastic with great characters too The first Jurassic World recaptured this and stretched out the reality but that was fine but the story in this one wasnt the bestI think it is time to leave this franchise now and let it go down as one of the best in the last  years,Notr
"Im writing this while Im watching it for the th time in  days
Each time I watched it  I had a different opinion  Remember when you watched the first Matrix 
maybe it was the sameFirst I was too excited too afraid of disappointment Too anxious to have a new experience of life time for the second time after the first original partThen when I saw how its going For the first hour I felt a mixture between shock disappointment Admiration for the boldness of the approach Excitement about the massive impact of that new bold approach for such an iconic movieThen I started to think like the director What the   Did she meant to do I got to a point That it wasnt just a sequel to the original  It was an exquisite way to make a statement of creativity Now I felt like an associate on the experience 
She meant to make me an accomplice at the new crime against the ordinary status quoNow I feel that while the first part was an eye opener This part is a heart opener by all means",Notr
i was really excited about the release of this when i watched it on the big screen i enjoyed it but it wasnt the prestige or momento it was similar to the matrix i was expecting the Nolan twist but this didnt happen there was mixed messages through out the film ie Michael cane when will you come back to reality maybe i got it wrong but i dont think he was in a dream in a dream in a dream but i think Nolan lost himself a bit in this one it is a good film very good but not the best id be happier to see a Nolan film with a  million dollar budget and i think hell pull a masterpiece of with it brilliant films can be made with small budgets i dont claim too be a film critic this is just an opinion,Positive
Its absolutely unwatchable Scenes alter with no logical storyline original characters are introduced like in a s sitcom its a new era of Jurassic World where we all live together and it just does not make any sense It feels like something made this movie and it wasnt a human being Like a deep fakeIt is worst than the first Jurassic World film and that one was pretty bad Pratt is below average in bothId rather rewatch Spielbergs original masterpiece or reread the book Or just sit and stare at the wall,Notr
I think that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made The acting is crisp and full of endless tension sometimes forlorn and on other occasions full of fear How Stephen King could come up with a horror story like this is beyond me Its a real nightmare to be in a penal system with so many things going against you Personally I think that Forrest Gump FG is also a tale of Hope but in a different sense Firstly FG shows the hope of waiting for the woman you love for over  years Secondly FG shows that there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society and aim for goals I think that both movies are great and should not be missed or inappropiately criticised I also urge people to watch La Vita e bella Life is beautiful as it is as good as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points May we all hope for more movies like thesePS Also watch Its a Wonderful Life James Stewart as this is about hope as well,Positive
My second favorite movie of all timeYou mustnt be afraid to dream a little bigger darlingI think its impossible to dream bigger than thisAn idea is like a parasite and Nolans idea is one simply brilliantThe plot is fantastic complex but not too difficult to followIncredible character interpretation I dont mention anyone because I would risk disrespecting someoneIts not just an action or science fiction film there is also a strong sentimentality its not too difficult to get emotional Time by Hans Zimmer really gives you chillsYet another Oscarwinning film from NolanInceptionthe Kings SpeechOh I forgot the ending is also unique perhaps the most iconic ending of all timeOur dreams feel real while were in them its only when we wake we realize things were strangeI watched this film  times and I still love every little detail of this masterpiece and if Im still sleeping please dont wake me up,Positive
This movie is the best film made by Nolan MANY PEOPLE relate this film to Matrix I dont get it Both these films are different,Positive
Ive seen the stage show twice in London got the DVD of the original cast doing it and have the songs in my music library If you like the original show this is not quite as good I think the attempts at adding humour and plot fall a bit flat and some of the effects detract from the performances rather than add to them But as a film adaptation of a musical its a lot better attempt than Les Miserables and if you take as a musical celebration of the original poems then its pretty good,Negative
The Dark Knight is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the superhero genre Christopher Nolans direction coupled with Heath Ledgers iconic portrayal of the Joker delivers a dark and gripping narrative The films intense action sequences moral complexity and stellar performances especially by Christian Bale as Batman make it a timeless classic Hans Zimmers haunting score adds to the tension creating an immersive experience The Dark Knight stands out as one of the greatest superhero films offering a compelling storyline complex characters and a perfect balance of darkness and heroism,Positive
This is one of the best movies about friendship Ive ever seen also one of the best prison movies I found it better than Robert Redfords CASTLE Morgan Freeman was perfect as usual and I can say that Tim Robbins reached the top of his performance and also his career I wish this couple come together for another movie the kind of it is not important Im sure the spectators will have the same taste as before I watched most of the films of Morgan Freeman and I can say this was the best of his normally he prefers to play in films like SevenKiss the girlsAlong came a spider but I think he should think again that which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts,Positive
its a masterpiece ladies and gentlemen an obvious masterpiece if I were to pirate this movie which I wont because then I would be defiling the sanctity of this masterpiece of a movie then I would watch it every day of my life forever alongside next years Minecraft movie which will also definitely be a clear masterpiece When I saw this movie with my friends they thought that this movie was complete garbage they arent Christians like I am I see the light and that light is the emoji movie,Negative
Plot is decent No real need to develop new characters It is fun fast paced and not so gory It was a good way to wrap things up It was better then the second one of this Trilogy,Notr
This film is a magnificent piece of work which will likely not be rivaled for years to come The most well known antagonist in the Batman comics is undoubtedly the Joker and Heath Ledger portrays the necessary insanity and sadism perfectly Christian Bale as Batman leaves nothing more to be desired and every shot of Gotham city fills you with the mystery and dread that you would expect from a city littered with crime You can feel the sense that the city is not in a good state directly from the movies beginning and the Dark Knight of Gotham has to rise to the challenge The entire plot line will pull you deeper into the movie Every time that you think that a little scene is unimportant there is sudden relevance to the bigger picture to Gotham It is simply one of the best movies that I have ever seen and I feel that DC did it right with The Dark Knight not to say that earlier Batman movies failed to leave you wanting for more as they all did for me,Positive
Yep you read the title This movie is not worth it This movie is about an oddoneout emoji whos supposed to be meh that lives in a phone ORIGINAL IDEA but makes a mistake and stuff so he teams up with the Carpool Karaoke guy as your worst nightmare and a female emoji who is actually a princess this whole time WRECKIT RALPH DID IT FIRST to make things right Who wants to play Spot the confusing product placement Basically It is just the worst movie ever made in the century heck it even made Foodfight look like The Lion King Its a good thing I havent seen this movie in theaters But hey That is just my opinion So whatever you do if there is one film or many films you need to watch Please PLEASE avoid this one This movie is just one big Sir Patrick Stewartfest,Negative
Shawshank is undeniably one of the greatest films of alltime The lessons is has the feelings you get and what you get out of it is more than most movies will ever do The acting is spot on the story the struggle the overcome it all wraps Shawshank into a bubble by itself You will be forever changed by watching this movie If youve yet to see it its an absolute must watch If you have seen it watch it again for the th time it gets better,Positive
Watch this movie and watch the original classic Jurassic Park The contrast is staggering on how stupid and Hollywood these movies have become It feels like they are trying to capture the same stupidity of the Fast  the Furious franchises latest entries The movie has high production value and decent acting but like many Hollywood turds the script is just unbelievably stupid I absolutely hated Fallen Kingdom for that very reason and this movie is no different Watch the movie to see how stupid it is for yourself if you dont believe me,Notr
I dont normally walk out of movies but this I had to its very confusing and the storyline is not clear what so ever I understand its a musical but its song after song and the dialogue is very minor The CGI is weird looking and I just couldnt watch the whole thing I had hopes for this movie but it really wasnt very good,Negative
The movie was fine nothing special We get to see dinosaurs as if we lived with themYou need to remember this is the th dinosaurs movie like it doesnt really have anywhere to go to be specialEnjoy it for what it is the th movie about humans bring dinosaurs back to life and now they live amongst us,Notr
Ok so looking at the reviews I thought I would give this a try I was a bit confused with the stream of either  and  maybe a bit marmite but NO absolutely NO I have  young children who are  and  and they like everything giggle and laugh at all the silly things in movies but this one they wasnt interested just went off and playedI work shifts for the ambulance service so my time is very limited with my little ones and to have wasted an hour and half actually makes me angry I think Patrick Stewart is a absolute brilliant actor and Im so sad he was wasted on this epically terrible filmThe  views are fake as no normal person in their right mind would give that maybe being really generous Anyway dont say I didnt warn you,Negative
It suucks Nothin is good from graphics to story to music never watching again,Negative
Had seen no trailers  i no idea went in with an open mind like a real matrix lover and understander should Loved loved loved it the story the twists the mind boggaling turns it took me back into the Matrix but a litte deeper You must be willing to travel and understand what this is about Sharp as a knive and a stand alione paradoxis it a loop can it be reached  wow  mind blowing basically if you didnt like it you didnt get it or just not ready yet but like the loop showed time will tell  i iwish you the best,Notr
It is an extraordinary cinematic masterpiece that unfurls a profoundly moving tale of hope friendship and the unyielding human spirit Tim Robbins portrays Andy Dufresne a man unjustly imprisoned for a crime he didnt commit while Morgan Freeman delivers a captivating performance as Red his fellow inmate and confidant As the story unfolds within the walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary the film explores the resilience of the human soul and the transformative power of hope in the darkest of circumstances Directed with skill and sensitivity by Frank Darabont this timeless classic weaves a tapestry of emotions leaving a lasting impression on its audience Hope Unchained The Shawshank Redemption continues to inspire and uplift reminding us that even in the face of adversity hope can set us free,Positive
As a younger viewer who wasnt born when the movie released I can by heart say that movieproductions has gone downhill Im not pointing out that all movies we produce today are bad but that in  years of evolving in technology and having good actors writers etc No movies would stand a chance to being as good as this was This movie shows the true art of directing and storytellingIts a kind of movie that got me thinking learning and at the same time connect emotionally with the charactersI pat myself on the back for going on IMDB and hitting the top rated movies of all time If I didnt I wouldnt have had the chance to view this masterpiece,Positive
Some Hollywood exec thought it would be a good idea to base an entire movie on the emojis on your phone Oh and Candy Crush features because you knowits also on your phone Was it a dry period for ideas Was this thought up by someone sitting on the toiletSo theyre absolutely stretching it as a concept as it is  but then add a terrible obvious plot and that uber turd James Corden as a voice actor seriously Hollywood there are other British people out there and youve got one of the worst animated movies of all timeIm seriously hoping someone lost their job over this one just ridiculously bad,Negative
"Other than being an advertising tool and predictable  mediocre story theres no reason to trash it Like the main character aspired to be this is just meh which in no way is the worst movie of any genre or era Film critics are so anticonventional and anti pop culture that theyre hating for hatings sake and then you get those pretentious middleaged people and meta youngsters to follow them
Simply put its a clich comingofage story about a boy who doesnt fit in and cannot meet the societal expectations Being a failure  outcast he manages to befriend a person who accepts him and helps him find a possible solution Eventually he meets a girl whos also not a social norm and helps him embrace who he isThis movie is not hard to understand not repulsive or atrocious and not an abomination on top of that it has somewhat imaginative visual aspects There are many worse movies out there Woody Woodpecker being the most recent one I watched which may have ACTUAL nonsensical story worse dialog really REALLY bad acting or pokemyeyesout special effects This is not worth the  star rating or the  so quit your whining ",Negative
I really liked this movie which I just recently saw for the first time strange indeed since it is more than  years old It reminded me naturally I would say to Papillon the s McQueenHoffman classicI like the story the acting basically everything and I definitely recommend it to everybody But compared to Papillon There are so many similarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came out of the blue Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared with Papillon And Papillon is simply even better It is emotionally much more touching and when even Freemans great performance doesnt match Hoffmans there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen  in that role I mean Tim gave a great performance but his role didnt give him the chance that Steve hadAnyway a joy to watch But please watch the original too its not oldfashioned at all I can only guess but I think the huge differential of  for SR and  for Papillon is because most young people have never seen Papillon,Positive
Is there a plot I watched the entire movie and could not find one The movie is about as exciting as watching a dead cat sleep I have no idea how this movie got funded there is no humor plot or any entertainment value Please use the money youd potentially waste on this movie to a more deserving charity children in Africa deserve your money more than the excuse of producers who created this movie,Negative
Despite its attempt at renewing the sequence of events that gets these Dino experts on the wrong side of the fence plot has a strange aimlessness to it Commercialisation of the Isla Nublars live stock might have been a good card to play or at least a militarisation gone wrong would have succeeded as a spinoff Also theres certainly a good amount of documenting the magnificent giants but some bits dont really add up a significant value to the succession These end up carving craters in which the hype gets lost All this clumsiness directs at the lack of originality to the story a common singular nemesis this time even without known origins and ending up exactly the same way as indominus is more like a gut punch to the hopeful viewer Dominion may age soon despite being the flashy new instalment but for all its carefully arranged encounters of new kinds its worth a watch,Notr
Inception remains one of my favorite scifi movies alongside  A Space Odyssey and Interstellar The soundtrack is incredible The ending has one of my favorite songs from Hans Summer All the characters are really likeable and the story is fun and exciting Some of the action scenes blew me away the first time I saw the movie as a kid and they still put a smile on my face They encouraged me to watch a behind the scenes on how they were shot I would highly recommend this movie to anyone regardless of what genre of movies they enjoy,Positive
I took ten yo boys to this movie to kick off summer vacation and we almost left we were all so bored My son  I loved the other movies but this was embarrassing Cant believe the corny dialog No story What a waste Waited a year and a total disappointment Surprised all of the actors signed on I know its  but ,Notr
This is less about the warnings of man playing god and our creation tuning on us and more that man is just awful and really bad because we are breathing and exist rather than correct the mistake lets conserve them and complain about us and the resolve is surprising giving the original premise,Notr
Decent entertainment somewhat memorable Why this is seen as such an incredible sensational work of art is beyond me I feel like this is one of the few crimethrillerprisonaction related films that met my expectations as in was A Good Film but that alone doesnt make it a classic,Positive
James corden is the only good part bad and unemotional voice acting Very bad storyline and sweet part,Negative
You can write a lot or you can write it briefly the best Batman movie ever Best director best actor in a leading role best actor in a supporting role best special effects,Positive
It was the worst movie I have ever seenIf you have unneeded excessive time of your life just watch itI paid in the cinema money and my time to sit and enjoy it however it was misunderstood not clear and till now I didnt get it I couldnt complete it till the end  min then I left,Notr
I question those trying to find the meaning of life and Academy Award performances from a dinosaur movie I found the movie quite entertaining and true to the original Jurassic Park concept The movie lines up with the old Saturday afternoon thrillers monster movies and science fiction epics The movie is fun That is all one really needs to know,Notr
Not wonderful but still a good summertime movie and fits right in with the other five movies Loved the callbacks to the other moviesyou cant make sequels without having callbacks  Not nearly as bad a movie as all of these reviews are making it out to be  out of  stars,Notr
Inception is a resplendent cinematic experience that had me hooked from the opening scene till the very end As a viewer I was enthralled by its intricate plot The characters in Inception are deeply nuanced and expertly portrayed by a remarkable ensemble cast The chemistry between the cast members is palpableVisually Inception is a feast for the eyes Inception demands your full attention to grasp its intricacies it requires active engagement and a willingness to navigate its twists and turns Some may find its complexity overwhelmingInception is a cinematic marvel that pushes the boundaries of storytelling Does it qualify as what is known as a masterpiece Yes However SOMETHING just something held me back from a  rating Im not quite sure what but theres just something small missing to get it to that perfect ratingIn conclusion would I watch it a second time Yes Would I recommend you to watch it for the first time Yes,Positive
With universal themes such as redemption friendship and gooddefeatsevil tale and without any significant technical flaws it may be difficult to dislike Shawshank Redemption one of welldone Hollywood flicks in the s by invisible employee directors while it may also be difficult to find it compelling imaginative and inspirational Despite a prison situation Tim Robbins keeps looking ridiculously gorgeous all the time but this is madeinHollywood,Positive
I remember seeing this as a kid and I can see issues with the movie before even knowing what it is Im a fan of Dragonball Z probably my number  favorite anime show of all time Year pass and I came to the realization that this so called adaptation film is a piece of utter garbage Heck maybe worst than The Last Airbender at least that film has a simple story from the cartoon series The action is terrible the visual effects is blend as hell the only good character in that movie was Master Roshi everything else is a clich executed horribly If The Last Airbender was the cake this movie is the cherry on top,Negative
wow i have just returned from a advanced screening of dark knightall i can say is wow the entire cast is incredible with a stand out by heath ledger the joker was the best character acting i have ever seen so scary so sad and darkly funny the action is outstanding the plot moves fast and there is never a dull moment simply put this movie is an instant classicChristian bale performance as batman is the best i have seen while he is in ledgers shadow this cant subtract from a truly dark batman characterAaron Eckharts version of two face is great a real change from the batman forever version again it keeps with the overall dark angry feel to this moviethe big question is heath ledger performance is it Oscar worthy i believe so i just hope his sad death doest subtract from this great movie,Positive
This is the worst film I have seen in a long timeAnd why is the idiot Corden in this  he cant act and is just a smarmy waste of space  even in this terrible movieThe film is like a giant vanity project  loads of cash thrown at junkDont waste your time or cash on this,Negative
No this wasnt Broadway Nothing can outdo that This was a movie projection of the Broadway play with a complete set Broadway is like reading a book and it becoming your imagination of what the set looked like This is how Andrew Lloyd Webber saw the set The main character is a ballet dancer in London And one of the guys is a ballet dancer and tap dancer in London I commend them for their talent especially his tap dancing skills You could tell he had been tap dancing from a very early age WOW Jennifer Hudson singing Memories was excellent Her singing is so soulful Taylor Swift sings Beautiful Ghosts and I enjoyed it very much I enjoyed it very much but you have to go in watching it as a movie not a broadway play Two very different things,Negative
Yeah its that badIts like the writer and director only reference to the source material was a retelling from a  year old Just avoid this no shade to the actors but if you are a true fan of Dragon Ball or new to the series turn back before its too late I recently watched this for podcast work and it was extremely difficult to get through I had to pause step away and take break I usually can find some silver lining in horrible movies but this was asking too much of me I typically dont care for live action adaptations of our favorite childhood shows but this was failed so hard,Negative
The cats still look like humans and that scares me cause that is what Dr Munreau does,Negative
Let me start off by saying this movie has some flawsThe villain has a very confusing motivation it was rushed it can be cringey at times and it is predictable that is why it is a  and not a  If you can look past this though you will see an interesting story about a man and his friend who suffered from a blood disease his entire life and just wanted to be cured When he takes the cure and it has side effects that are horrible he decides his friend would be better off the way his friend is for now I would even say it is kind of sad,Notr

This film is more than a film Its art Out of the many outstanding qualities the themes are the most impressive It serves as a reflection on our own society the breaking of norms and the oppressive Orwellian government pushing whats different down True authenticity is a rarity in our culture with the transcendent message of the film and the innovative concept and animation The way this film was done has never been done before Ever There is literally nothing like it Focusing instead on making a masterpiece rather than making money instead of being an half assed ad like Anomalisa The Emoji restores my faith in film and in turn restores my faith in humanity Definitely deserves its own cinematic universe  out of ,Negative
Yes the rumors of how bad it is are quite true But look Everybody makes mistakes from time to time and this was one of the worst from the studio Yeah there were Smurf movies but those just were made from greed This one just feels like Battlefield Earth made by a cultThe story is boring and steals plot elements from other better movies the animation has some good qualities but other cringy parts that take over the voice acting sucks the tone is obnoxious and its filled to the brim with PRODUCT PLACEMENT I was waiting for a time when it would cut to a commercial midway or advertise mypillow in the middle of the film Or have someone scream IAMNOTOKAY in the middle at the top of their lungs,Negative

When i knew  goku was going to be an American  a year ago  i had a very ominous feeling about the film  and when i saw the theatrical trailer  i knew then that FOX has completely destroyed this Asian epic This is what you get when someone tries to Americanize a true masterpieceAs an ardent fan of dbdbzdbgt i was shocked to see  as to how bad a movie can really get Bad acting by almost all actors  very poor visual effects  ive seen movies in the s have better visual effects  Bad directing  bad screenplay  bad story  theyve tampered the story so bad that i was so devastated after watching the film  had sleepless nights for days  Watch the movie and ull see what i mean  This is what happens when you take a film without seeing one king episode  rather the director has developed the movie after reading a summary The movie was so bad that ud cry even in the scenes that the director meant to be funny and vice versa My advice is that dont watch this film  do something more worthwhile like cursing the director,Negative
I went with my  year old daughter and we both liked it Its not excellent but its an action paced animated movie that feels goodThe plot is at least original Sure it has lots of product placement but it couldnt be otherwise Actually the movie is all about product placement But thats OK thats actually how it relates to the audience that know each app on our smartphone and you use them everyday And thats actually what makes it interesting and compelling How could a movie about your phone be with fake names and fake apps it wouldnt make senseHowever the action felt like they were just passing each level from one app to the other until the final destination And its not that funny but it has some nice funny lines that make you smile but not laugh My kid laughed a bit with the easy jokes Positive points for the animation liked the Instagram bit especially for the really nice D feelDespicable Me  is funnier Cars  is more adventurous But Emoji relates more to the audience and to the real life,Negative
Sure the movie sometimes mimics Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out but this movie I loved Ignore the  star rate and just check it out If you dont like it dont watch But Im just saying this movie deserves more love in my opinion If its that underrated then would you rather watch Shrek  or Home Alone ,Negative

The Emoji Movie is a movie like no other It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy romance and creative story line The Emoji Movie is a delightful comedy about an emoji and his quest to fit in The movie has a brilliant story line following the path of a confused emoji as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy The story line is layered for different levels of understanding it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages While there are subtle comedic lines amuse adults it is the simple humor such as the Poop emoji going to the toilet that amuses children The amazing cast of The Emoji Movie including TJ Miller and Sir Patrick Stewart do a great job of living up to expectations The Emoji Movie has something for everyone it is a great animated tale that is wonderful for adults and children alike,Negative
not for a reason but for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories its themes the tension the moral questions the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation are bones of a splendid film a film who reminds more than presents values roots of justice beauty of original source the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer short  a film who must see ,Positive
Truly ambitious movie which has themes hope retribution and kindness themes surely needed in this climate we live in I tend to judge movies and fact most anyting from the view of perception and intention You see no one makes a movie assembles wonderful Talent spend unheardof amounts of money to intentionally have people dislike it now thats not to say I didnt fall asleep in certain sections of the picture and that doesnt mean that at times the direction is a bit leaden But for the most part I understood what the director was trying to accomplish and commend him for it and actually had a good time Judi Dench Taylor Swift Idris Elba Jennifer Hudson and Company perform and emote very very well the dance sequences very well done however this was a hard project to pull off from being on BroadwayGo see the film and open your heart and maybe then youll understand a very wellintentioned movie musical but simply not for everybody,Negative
I think this film is overrated I had high hopes going to see this film because the musical was good but it isnt good when you have the entire movie just singing about cats I didnt even understand what a jellical cat was and I found it really annoyingTheres no plot to it and I wish it had some kind of backstory or at least some drama but it was terrible I was bored out of my seat and waited for it to finish It was so boring They wouldnt stop screeching their voicesIts like that film you watch and you forget about for years like some nightmare,Negative
With that i meen they actually manage to create a movie that was worse then there last bomb the reboot of GhostbustersAt this point i truly think Sony want to destroy themselvesSee a bunch of eather bots or paid reviewers giving this pile of oozing crap  raitingDo nor Believe themFor your mental health sake stay away from this movie at all cost,Negative
Please dont listen or watch or read the reviews for this incredible movie I guarantee these folks didnt see the movie they are just upset it was an amazing experience like the one I had For weeks I have been awaiting this gem to arrive at my local theater house For weeks I have been ranting and raving and just having pure excitement knowing my girl Sophia will be costarring The movie is well directed and the score goes right to the heart of my soul I loved how the movie had credits at the beginning and end I enjoyed the message and I wasnt let down I stayed in the theater for  consecutive showings until I was removed by the usher I highly recommend this movie be a part of your legacy,Negative
 was an absolute golden experience would smash again,Negative
This is my dads favorite movie and has been since the day it came out It hurts me to break his heart but The Shawshank Redemption is just pretty goodThe highlight is  the characters Each is welldeveloped and has their own stories and problems but this is not unlike most movies in this category This movie obviously was released at the right time and place for its position Everything felt so average maybe slightly above averageI have seen this movie at least ten times The message is deep the character development is great but everything else is just average,Positive
Total embarrassment just because you can do something doesnt mean you should I can drive with my feet doesnt mean its a good idea,Negative
One of the best films of all time A source of inspiration and emotion A reminder that no matter how dire life is hope always survives,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption directed by Frank Darabont is a poignant tale of hope and friendship set in the confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary Tim Robbins delivers a compelling performance as Andy Dufresne a man wrongfully imprisoned while Morgan Freeman shines as Ellis Red Redding his wise and seasoned friend The film masterfully explores themes of resilience and the human spirit showcasing how bonds can flourish even in the darkest of places With stunning cinematography and a haunting score by Thomas Newman the film captivates from start to finish Its powerful message about hope and redemption resonates deeply making it a timeless classic A mustwatch,Positive
Awful adaptation of a classic musical Shame really could of been amazing,Negative
"Well the idiocy is off the scale with this one
The entire budget was blown on the CGI no money left for anyone to provide any guidance on anything remotely scientific and intelligent
Multiple efforts to ram the message down your throat are included as is the forced diversity resulting in unbelievable characters
Yes it is as bad as you have heard sorry

simply the best movie ever made this movie embraces the philosophy that justice will be done karma is heard and that goodness will rule above anything in this world Andy and reds friendship is a strong unique bond founded under the harshest of circumstances In prison they each serve their time for situations they got themselves into but certainly didnt form them as men  or messed with their true character Andy has no choice but to try and accept his fate that he will be in Shawshank forever  and on the surface he rises to the occasion by doing the paperwork for the sadistic warden who treats Andy like the lowest of the low In the meantime Reds parole is continuously declined and they both have to readjust even though their life in prison sometimes offers them glimpses of hope and of freedom Will the time really come and if yesare they ready for it,Positive
Wow Its not often that I walk out of a cinema after seeing a movie and feel the need to pinch myself This film is so clever that I truly thought that it was out of human capability to come up with a story line so complex but yet fits so perfectly togetherWhen reading a description of this film in the cinema magazine that you pick up before you go in Im not going to lie I was terrified Having already ordered my tickets and being unable to change my mind the words Hold on to your heads for a real brain bender put me off instantly This description of the film made me expect something along the lines of The butterfly effect or Donnie Darko neither of which I fully got my head around and mainly watched for the hunky male leadsHowever I couldnt be more wrong about this masterpiece of a film I cannot really summarise in words how much it will make your jaw drop continuously throughout and highly recommend that you see thisIn conclusion  Phenomenal performances from everyone on screen  Fantastic music  Fantastic settings  Pure genius of a story line  Flawless Do not miss out on this fasten your seatbelts to be truly blown away,Positive
The first movie that I saw of this guy was Memento and I was so much thrilled that I couldnt sleep the whole night and then Batman revival follows through Batman Begins and I was wondering how can one get lucky all the time but he again proved me wrong with Prestige Then again i felt that this would be last but Dark Knight as the world knows overshadowed everything that the world had seen so far And I said to myself wait a minute this seems to be too much too good to be true so I went to see Inception in fear mingled with excitement that this has to be a flop but my heart wanted it to be a good movieand oh my dear I couldnt believe what I saw what I heard and what I experienced and was so tremendously elevated by this supreme intelligent movie that i pinched myself to check if Im in a real world or a dream world Simply the most magnificent movie of his era and the best was not the way Christopher Nolan thought but the way he could somehow managed to show in form of cinema Truly a super class act a Masterpiece Hats off to Nolan and brilliant acting by LeonardodeCaprio Ellen Page and other supporting folks,Positive
Have seen worse I didnt fall asleep which is a good barometer for a film Didnt like Jason Derulo sp but I dont like his vocals anyway also not a fan of Rebel Wilson or James Corden The main chorus parts were fab ie the stage performers and even Taylor Swift did a fantastic job Jennifer Hudson did murder Memories though and I wish I could un hear it All in all Id rather watch this again than have to sit through Avatar which IMO is the worst film EVER,Negative
One of the best movies I have ever watched It is fascinating the story structure of Inception and how deep it is It is a bit long but you dont feel time passing as you are drown into the story you forget everything I like films that doesnt spoonfeed me information I found Inception one of these films that you need to stay awake and focused to understand every minute throughout the whole thing The cinematography is brilliant and the production design of different locations in different countries Leonardo Dicaprio once again brilliantly pulls off his character and gets every one of the audience involved with his amazing acting,Positive
Having grown up in the s Jurassic Park was a big part of my life I have enjoyed the movies for years This newest movie is fantastic I loved it as did the five other people I went with It was fun to see all the separate stories come together and seeing old favorites was exciting It was all really well doneacting effects music writing the action the humor If you cant enjoy a movie like this then you want too muchGone are the days when people can just go to a movie and enjoy it as it is and not expect it to change their entire life Movies are meant to be enjoyed they are meant to take you away for a short time When did it stop being like that If you want to be shocked and scared and changedwatch the freakin news,Notr
Honestly was the reading the Critics reviews saying how bad the film was Wasnt even that bad the CGI wasnt even that bad either Jared Letos performance for someone who is suffering a progressive blood disorder seems rather on point where as critics saying is was a dull performance which doesnt make sense at all the story seemed like it was made for something to be built up to in the future This film doesnt seem like it was made to be a one time outstanding amazing film it felt more like a good solid film that you could rewatch and that its building up to something bigger My opinion would be ignore the critics go watch the film yourself watch the to midcredit scenes and make up your own mind,Notr
This is the most boring movie i have ever watched Jokes were for  year olds story was very stupid characters were bland and lacking depth the settings of the film were very unthoughtful and half of the movie was pure cringe Even the music was depressing Its like the producers fell asleep on their jobs They also clearly rushed it yet they had years to make this movie Marvel had the same time as them and how come they did a better job This movie had only an hour and  minutes in screen time That is basically a little less than half of a normal movie It should be in the animated shorts section to make sure nobody watches it So if you want to waste a short amount of time making fun of a crappy of a movie then do so If not dont waste your time your eyes will bleed Only watch it and make fun of it when you can watch it illegally on some Youtube channel before it gets shut down,Negative
Have watched this in so many coutries around the world on my travels Had it on VHS then DVD then Blu Ray and now on my iPad I still watch it when it comes on TV If you havent seen it watch it you will not regret itThe characters are amazing the story realistic and it draws you in As it goes over a  year period it is mazing how the characters age properly the trends change with posters music etc even if there is a slight mistake with one of the albums not being available for another  years after the period shown You laugh you cry and you will cheer for the guys in the jail For Andy doing that stretch when youre really innocentwell,Positive
Theres a villain full of colour takes to the stage a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage a Mafioso kind of broker its the one and only Joker hands of torment turmoil tortures what hell rage A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon The Batman Harvey Dent Lieutenant Gordon but theyre seduced by the performance limited by laws conformance the playmaker relishing all the destruction Its not too long before their weaknesses are found as hostages are taken to compound ultimatums are presented prominent profiles are demented and our hero runs for cover goes underground,Positive
Absolutely loved this movie Great fun to see with your kids and felt so good to see the original cast again Lots of tongueincheek references for those of us who know the first ones by heart Now Its not perfect but then it isnt meant to be Watch it for the fun the action the magnificent dinosaurs and brilliant chemistry between the cast members Dont forget the popcorn,Notr
Something that started out rock solid super cool goes from a  to a  in  LOOOOONNNNG movies I was hoping this was going to be the one that started The Matrix series back in upward movement but clearly about  minutes in it just wasnt going to happen Why oh why could they not do something cool with lots of energy I understand why some decided not to return to this bloated love story that should have never been made,Notr
Before you read this know that I am NOT being sarcastic I dont know why it has such bad reviews Why are people hating this movie Its sad that the animators and studio are not getting praised for making a very good movie It is well animated and has a good storyIf you like animated films I recommend you to watch this,Negative
The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mishmash lacking logic and cohesionTechnically the film is well made That is it looks and feels like a blockbuster though a solid score is sorely lackingOn the plus side Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensembleAnd sadly a fine actor will be remembered not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy but rather an excellent makeup job an overactive tongue and a silly voice As farewell performances rate Heath Ledgers Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu ManchuTo remind yourself how super hero movies should be made dust off your copy of Spiderman II from which it borrows or Superman The Movie from which it shouldve borrowed,Positive
As someone who has read Crichtons books darn near all of them still havent read Airframe this movie was all the things Wrap it up full circle deep commentary on the scientific power we wield as humans with both miraculous and disastrous consequences This is not a crowdpleasing no need to think monsteraction movie Which is something Michael Crichtons original novel was never meant to be At long last the second franchise finally got back to the roots of what the books were really about And I loved every second of it,Notr
This movie if great for kids I enjoy watching it too The only thing that sort of bothered me is the underlying message It has a little of the PC feel but doesnt push it too hard You know the everybodys trying to stay in their expected social cues and anyone that breaks from the patriarch will be hunted down and killed That PC But your kids will love it and shouldnt read between the lines I ask you not to either Just enjoy the movie for what it is Dumb fun with some really cool moments and understanding of what really happens when we press the little emoji button on our phones,Negative
How in gods glorious kingdom was this movie green lighted Ive seen better plots on CornHub Nothing about this movie says Marvel in literally any way as its overdone CGI non existent story line and overall boring premise reminds me more of an Ernest movie than anything else Who did they think would like this Its slop Cinematic slop What kind of suicidal thoughts are these poor MCU writers having to make them write this It feels like one of those writing exercises where you just dont stop writing until you have a page and thats your story premise However most people edit them or just dont use them if theyre bad Marvel clearly hired a stoner to write this movie I cant say enough times how unbelievably bad the plot of this movie is The story makes no sense isnt given enough context things just happen for literally no reason and the characters are about as unique as a can of creamed corn from Nazi Germany,Notr
I cant believe I had to give this piece of crap a  out of  Zero or even negative integers should be an option Thats all I have to say I am a huge Dragonball Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT fan and I was anxiously awaiting this film for over a year now I dont know where to begin with this film The story was terrible Oozaru was a disciple of Piccolo Piccolo looked like The Mask Goku was so unsure of himself and his abilities it was sickening I have to have faith in who I am give me a freaking break Master Roshi lives in an apartment building Bulma is a guntoting bad ass Yamcha cant even fight The th birthday and solar eclipse motifs have been overdone in the past and they just continued those hackneyed themes I just wanted to vomit during this film I could go on and on about what is wrong with this movie but I dont want to develop and ulcer,Negative
I am being serious There IS something to them claiming that the US is the devil The more I read into it the more their cause seems plausible to me The movie is so stunningly bad it will be the major talking point in hushed and serious tones akin to talking about a new and unstoppable strain of Ebola across all known and unknown media It is an extinction level event all by itself Someone actually sat down and penned this terminal cancer I had to sit down through the entire sad affair because it was too horrible not to This movie is the  Hiroshima and Nagasaki of your soul,Negative
OK From the time I started watching Dragonball it was a very good cartoon And what the creators did is wrong I feel if you are going to make a movie based off a series of anime I say please watch the anime first It will give you knowledge about the characters and you can create a better storyboard The Dragonball series has been out for  years and from what I have seen from this movie you did the exact opposite To the people who have not seen the serieswatch it first and understand what is happening so when you see this bad creation of a movie you will understand what has been done Im sorry but I am unhappy with this film,Negative
All that stuff about sharing dreams makes zero scientific or philosophical sense And noone can have dreams with that amount of detail that many actors that much lightning fast action etc etc Read Daniel Dennett There were plenty of stunning special effects and stunts certainly but I had the feeling throughout that the plot was just a peg to hang these on If you want to see how to do dreams in cinema look elsewhere for example the dream sequence in Wild Strawberries the Soldiers dreams in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie the whole of Un Chien Andalou Even Buster Keaton did better than this in Sherlock Junior odd years agoIf youre going to make a film about dreaming first figure out how to film dreams,Positive
What can I say Except its terrible Me being me decided to just watch the ending on youtube so I wouldnt waste my money on this garbage Yep its bad Dont waste your money on this one Tbh Id rather make love with a cat than spend money on this freak show I mean if you have a son or daughter that wants to see this just take them to see the latest horror movie Trust me its for the best,Negative
I got the opportunity to see this movie a week in advance  Let me just say it is no disappointment in every witch way As most of Leonardos movies are good this one is even better it will blow your mind so yes i recommend everyone should see it even if you like Leos work you will still enjoy this movie Moments in the film keep you at the edge of your seat waiting to find out what happens next I fell in love with this movie because of its originality and the imagination that took in to realizing this movie Christopher Nolan has yet again made another great movie All the cast members did an amazing job with Inception Thank you for making this movie Im sure i will see it plenty more times,Positive
So this is a hr ad everything is wrong with this movie watch toy story or wreck it ralph instead dont spend your time hereThis is the shortest review I have ever written,Negative
This movie is nothing in comparison to the original Dragon ballDBZ anime if they made a movie out of dbz properly that would be sooo awesome But this one sadly was just awful Piccolo was not like Piccolo the dragon balls werent made that way everything about each character was wrong Goku is much different The feel of the anime is what gives Dragon Ball z that unique touch but I guess well never have that technology to be able to make a good enough movie out of it And they probably think there arent enough fans I think differently as I see how there are  million people who like the facebook page that alone is a lot for a Facebook page and then the word spreads about how good it is and the advertisement should draw people to see it as the tech should be insane as the fights are just Awesome,Negative
Everything from the plot to the finish is superb The ending is unreal absolute gem,Positive
"If anyone ask me what is the name of your favorite movie 
I will say inception is one of the best movie i have ever seen

Its exactly what the movie should be It calls back to the first three it reminds you of the excitement of the first one it brings everyone together and ties the story up I really enjoyed it,Notr

An excellent movie that can surely move you a bit It throws open the question that can we really have prisons which are redemption centers in the true sense At the same time it redefines the word criminal Are the heinous acts committed by administrative authorities justifiable by any means There should be a code of conduct for the authorities and a HOLY PRISON MAINTENANCE BIBLE if any reformation has to take place The movie goes through several touching incidents and may bore you a bit if you rarely sees serious touching movies and are fans of slick scifi thrillers moving at extraordinary pace like Matrix etc However the exceptional acting by lead stars particularly by Morgan Freeman and the picking up of the tempo in the second half will leave you gasping for more After Citizen Kane Casablanca  Godfather it is another classic that will stay in the echelons of the movie rating lists for long There are a few weak points though There was insufficient attention given to some characters and movie portrays just one side of the whole story not remaining fair to the prison authorities And finally if it was told in a nonlinear tale then it would have been much more interesting,Positive
This movie was much anticipated but felt rushed and lacking in action It was great to see how they explain how they were able to bring Neo and Trinity back from the dead but as the main focus of the movie being them getting back together realizing this and seeing how much of the runtime was left I realized the movie was not going to be great We are now left with more questions and probably wont get more movies after this to explain them Hopefully we do and hopefully they are better If you go into the movie knowing its about them getting back together again not bad Nostalgia was also very high and was happy to see references to the other films,Notr
"I got so bored while watching it that while it was still playing i made this IMDb account just to rate it  star This movie is the reason why IMDb needs to add a  star rating
There has been an experiment in which a person is shocked when he touches a button says that hes never going to touch it then he gets put in a room with the button and they get so bored that they touch the button multiple times just because they have nothing better to do
Now if they repeat this experiment but this time they replace the electric shock and the button with the Emoji Movie its going to bring in media attention and lawsuits because its unethical to lock up a person in the same room as this horrendous movie",Negative
The Shawshank Redemption undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie The movie depicts how a four lettered word Hope brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possibleThough the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane just amazing and how he influences his fellow prisoner Red The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of Red is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across This story proves that the king of horrors Stephen King is equally good at any other genre of Story WritingHats off The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring The background score of the movie is excellent Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red respectivelyDidnt watch the moviego grab a DVD and watch it as soon as possible Cant miss a movie like this,Positive
The Emoji Movie is full a disgusted garbageand even worse filmthat you will never see thisThe Emoji Movie was features T J Miller and alsoit copies from The Lego MovieWreck it Ralph Toy Story and even Inside Out Never see this movie at allAnd also it was going to be Popeye movie by Sony but it cancelled and it replacing with The Emoji Movie which its a stupid idea to replacing with a Popeye movie with this garbage And it has one scene where it put Candy Crush in this movie How even know about they put in the Candy Crush in this movie Even though I like Candy CrushEmojis EverywhereAnd what is this about itI used to like this movie but now I dont I like it since July  and I started to hate it on  Thank goodness it got sold out,Negative
The movie is pretty boring and bad however the joker scenes are amazing If the whole movie was like his scenes I wouldve given it  stars However sadly the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like  scenes with him Batman is pretty comedic in this movie Which is not a good thing He is always acting serious but his voice is just how do I say this cringe worthy Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up yes those videos exist please monitor what your kids are doingwatching online The movie ends pretty abruptly and left me confused I recommend watching Joker instead,Positive
I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely one of my all time favorites A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE HOPE  One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving  finding something that we dream of In the words of this movies protagonist  hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan FreemanA must watch if you havent,Positive
I WISH they would have kept the show focused on Chris Pratt instead of doing equal time to all these other characters You can definitely tell Hollywood to cramming all these female actors down our throats FINE But THIS movie started Chris Pratt Im expecting to see mostly Chris Pratt Ugh Show up an hr into the movie and youll be fine It was more of a mini series crammed into hrs and it didnt work Should have kept the focus on the main character and his relationship with Blue and her baby If you have nothing else to watch and its really hot where you live right now AND you need a good nap go see it ,Notr
This is the greatest movie I have ever seen I think that this was even better than cool cat saves the kids I was hesitant to watch this movie but after I the commercials for the candy crush part My Favorite GameI had to see this so I forced my kids into the car and made them watch the whole movie ,Negative
Visually the cinematography was excellent The story was weak and I am shocked how many people are giving this  stars  people I worked with saw this and only  liked it This is two weird movies in a row made by Leonardo DiCaprioI feel like Nolan is just revamping parts of Memento Batman Dark Knight etc to his movies The ending credits are the same for every movie He put in a fortress in the snow like the fortress in the beginning of Batman Returns And what about that snow Its like he just wanted to say lets film in the snow He is actually stealing a lot of this from other movies and getting the credit for this being an original movie This movie is Oceans Eleven meets The Island I was very disappointed,Positive
Ignore the hatersits not a great masterpiece but its fun I really liked all the Easter eggs and it was great to see the old cast back Worth the money to see on the big screen Dont understand the hate because its non stop action and a fun ride,Notr
The movie had plot up the wazoo The acting was superb Robbins and Freeman were at their highest in this movie  There were so many emotions flying through it and there was so much about the human mind  It will leave you in awe,Positive
I finally watched this solely because of the bad reviews and because its on Netflix and I dont understand whats so bad about itIt wasnt a great movie but really wasnt that bad It had an actual plot a decent enough script and there was character growth Id rank it significantly higher than the  animated disasters Despicable Me  and The Garfield Movieboth which were unwatchable The Emoji Movie had its cringe moments especially when outoftouch Hollywood decided again to play s music for children but overall was an okay movieMy main issue is that they targetted the wrong audience Children arent really texting and there wouldve just been more opportunity if they had made this an adult cartoon Emojis are used a lot on dating apps and texting apps but not so much on Spotify and Just Dance,Negative
Good lord this movie is garbage I didnt even know it was a DBZ movie and I thought it was some crappy parody or something This doesnt feel like a Dragon Ball movie at all It feels like a rushed middle school projectTo be fair the writer of Evolution has admitted he never watched Dragon Ball but I didnt think it would be this badThe characters look nothing like they did in the source material and they dont even act the same Krillin is not in the movie Roshi looked like a some  year old man wanting to be hip with kids Bulma is now a bounty hunter Since when Its kinda sad how the only characters that were almost accurate were Gohan and MaiBut lets talk about the biggest thing they got wrong Goku Hes nothing like the one we all know hes apparently this socially awkward teen womanizer that goes to schoolYou know the movies bad when Toriyama himself also hated the movie,Negative
My favorite movie ever  These are words that basically describe how I feel about this movie  A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie but this is very entertaining  Tim Robbins The Player IQ stars as Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover  He arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prisons head convicts wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman Driving Miss Daisy Seven  Soon the warden played by Bob Gunton Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil Broken Arrow enlists his help as a banker to help with getting some extra illegal money and other things  It doesnt sound like a great movie but trust me this is the best movie Ive ever seen and everyone I know liked it  Tim Robbins is great in the lead  Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden  William Sadler Solo Die Hard  is solid as a fellow convict  Clancy Brown Starship Troopers Highlander is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards  Finally James Whitmore The Relic and Gil Bellows Snow White A tale of terror give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts  A must see,Positive
This movie is a total piece of manipulation It does have a few redeeming features though  Morgan Freemans narration all through is pure art This guy acts with his mouth As a piece of fiction it has some merit and I can see why many people would enjoy it But to be classed as one of the best movies of all time  really Cmon Certainly the portrayal of the brutality of the guards during those times I would say is fairly realisticThe one part of the story where an old timer gets released does ring true There are many people like that who are totally institutionalized and do not have the skill to survive on the outside without a good support network in placeThis is a movie for those people who like everything laid out perfectly for them and doesnt require any thinking Personally I like a bit more depth and realityI dont want to put people off seeing it  it should be watched once But for me the flaws outweigh its redeeming features,Positive
Other than names and likenesses this movie used nothing from the source material and was a massive let down It is  percent clear that nobodys heart or mind for that matter was in this film It ruined Wongs directing career and made it impossible to adapt any film from a Japanese IP for at least a decade This was a total cash grab by FOX and they basically admitted it They had the rights it was about to expire so they slid this absolute deuce out onto the silver screen The majority of the budget was spent on marketing just so they would at least break even This is all wildly similar to the story of how the live action Super Mario Bros of the s was made and received,Negative
It came it made more then the budget and left a sour taste in everyones mouth after watching it awful movie,Negative
Cant even explain how bad this movie is so heres an emoji of a sad cat ,Negative
Theres a few low scores on this film but overall I enjoyed itYes I agree the story line isnt the best in the world but what do you expect its going to be about dinosaurs people being bad and people being nibbled a bit its what all the other films where aboutPerhaps  is a little high but Ill stick with it  I enjoyed the film If you liked the other ones the chances are youll like this one,Notr
myself n my parents got out of the theater in just about  Mins We struggled hard to see for first  Mins as well Since we paid for the movie  we candidly sat for  Mins Nothing interesting Bad jokes bad screenplay confusing emoji and particularly the initial scene of the movie from hotel Transylvania was damn horrible and bad,Negative
This is a realy good film for to watch with your family I wuldnt say this movie was bad I WULD SAY THAT ITS REALY GOOD,Negative
I almost feel like this movie is some cruel joke theres no need to even really review it this movie a waste of time money talent everything it will just depress you at how desperate hollywood is for a cash grab and how they think were all mindless consumersthis movie had one good thing it made me realize we should be demanding better movies its our money were spending and this is what they expect us to purchase,Negative
If your brain is feeling flabby take it to Inception for a good workout Christopher Nolan once again tells a fascinating story in a very unique way I also applaud Nolans decision to not do this film in trendy D Im sure I will be thinking and dreaming about Inception for days to come,Positive
Colourful bright with lovely animation The story is decent fairly clich kids movie younger kids will probably love it less so for older kids The product placement is very very heavy handed and conspicuous and its meme attempts are laughably bad Kids are unlikely to notice but theres some so bad its good novelty for the older viewers Overall it has okay character and message that even adults can quite enjoy and get somewhat immersed in Its overall very OK I would rate  star if it wasnt so ridiculously full of product placement and their strong female character is quite forced Seriously strong women dont need to constantly reassert how strong and independent they are The message of this movie USE DROPBOX PLAY CANDY CRUSH AND DDR AND DID YOU KNOW DROPBOX IS SECURE Oh and be yourself and accept everyone for who they are Gene the main character is a meh emoji and that reflects the movie Its just meh,Negative
If you have not seen this film yet you are really missing something in your life It is almost like never tasting Coca ColaThis film is that good The great Morgan Freeman not only puts in the greatest acting performance of his life but quite possibly the greatest performance of all timeThe script is so excellent that every word spoken sticks in your mind and later on in the movie you remember every word before it is recollectedThis film makes you angry upset romantic sick and elated It touches all of the senses and you cannot take your eyes off the screen for one minuteThe cinematography is excellent and so is the research and hard work that has gone into ensuring that all of the costumes and props are of the era,Positive
I have to admit I do not understand how everyone hates this movie Im not quite saying that this is a gem but despite some issues its actually quite an alright movieFirst theres a point some kind of message simplistic as it might be which is more than I can say for most movies of the current decade Second the cast can actually sing and dance Which has most certainly not been the case with some of the most popular musicals of the recent era La La Land comes to mindAnd while Im sure the cat costumes were not for everyone I dont believe the ratings here in any way reflect the quality of the movie,Negative
Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover He always professes his innocence but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red Morgan FreemanDirector Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story Its his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow Freeman gave the readings depthIf there is one complaint it is Andys claim of innocence It needs to be shown early on during the trial Instead we derived mostly from Andys demeanor It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning When Tommy Gil Bellows tells the story he should include one detail from the trial like the  bullets That way the audience can get an aha moment Its a minor point and overall this is a good prison fable,Positive
A nonsensical plot the worst CGI Ive seen in years and the worst scene the Rebel Wilson with cockroaches on a cake I can recall in a movie The film simply should have been thrown out at the drawing board stage It really does deserve every one star review its receiving The only positive was the performance of Francesca Hayward who was seriously let down by everything else from production direction CGI and other performances from the A list cast Haywood deserved more but its an absolute mess of a film,Negative
This movie was amazing the effects were great I cant believe why anyone would not like this movie It was truly amazing I dont know why you wouldnt like the movie but i loved it I recommend this movie to everyone,Notr
Even though the subject matter is dark I consider this the perfect movie I cant count how many times I have rewatched it but Shawshank always engages me and keeps me captivated like few other films have I admittedly have never read the King short story  Im afraid it will disappoint me  but I probably should One thing I like most about this movie is the friendship portrayed by Freeman and Robbins it seems so natural and sweet I also love that this is a long movie  minutes would not have done it justice I know a lot of younger audiences complain about long movies due to their short attention spans but as I said this movie is perfect as is Please do NOT remake it,Positive
Theres a lot of hate on this movie and some is not entirely without merit Actually one of the  star reviewer almost got to me until he mentioned Angry Birds arguable but especially the Lego movies You cant put those in the same bin as this The Lego movies especially really have a quality to them that speaks to both adults and children Something this movie does not haveBut is it like a disease as some have suggested Id say not I do get the corporate idea thing that they try to shove into our brain Lets keep it real though that always existed And this movie tries to bank on that It doesnt really succeed and while it tries to copy a couple of things Pixar and other animated movies did it never reaches that quality Having said that Ive seen worse  and I know that is not an excuse for some concerning my rating but its the truth,Negative
I do not know what to say I am just bored Many people say that is the best Movie False,Positive
"Emoji the movie is a lovely animation i just cant believe that movies like it has  stars and cartoons as this one only has  
i am very upset with people that says its a cheap movie because sony spent less than  milions Let me tell you something money is not everything 
 very funny movie and its very nice see our emoji alive",Negative
The film is not bad but it disappointed me New and historical characters are not used convincingly and history has bored me A disappointing film that does not end the Jurassic World saga as it should,Notr
Do not listen to the critics or bad reviews this is a good movie I recommend seeing this movie the movie has gotten a lot of hate but it doesnt deserve it I only wish the movie was a little longer,Notr
One of the best films Ive ever seen you just have to see it for yourself and you will know why However if youre a big Sly or Arnold fan you may not like it as it doesnt have any exploding cars plus it has a lot of dialogue and some words with more than two syllables,Positive
This movie came out on my birthday July   so I went to see as a present from my parents I had high expectations seeing as how Chris Nolan is one of my favorite Directors and Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors I was blown away by the acting directing plot and special effects of this film This movie easily replaced The Departed as my favorite film of all time This movie is just so perfect I was on the edge of my seat the whole time in the Theater I was thinking about this movie the whole night after I got home from the theater so I just decided to write a review about it to tell everyone to go see it I am true to my word when I say that this movie is unbelievable and it is a must see This film has many Oscars coming its way,Positive
From the moment your gaze falls upon the films poster you brace yourself for a comedic ride anticipating the cinematic fiasco thats about to unfold Venturing into the theater laughter was expected but instead I was greeted by a parody of Dragon Ball so audaciously flawed it borders on comic genius This film attempts to ground the beloved saga in reality but strays so far from its inspiration it seems the creators set out to disappointEfforts to mirror Dragon Balls essence end up resembling reflections in a carnivals distorted mirror warped bizarre and unintentionally hilarious This cinematic endeavor serves as a masterclass in how not to execute a parody blending misplaced sarcasm misguided satire and a remarkable inability to hit any target Those seeking laughter will find it not in the script but in marveling at how spectacularly this film fails to capture what made the original so greatIn a twistedly ironic way it becomes the perfect comedy its misalignment so egregious laughter is the only response to its boldness With over  characters of critique this review highlights the films journey from potential to comedic folly marking Dragon Ball Evolution as an unintentionally humorous chapter in the Saiyan saga,Negative
This film was a failure before it was even released Outraged internet personalities and millions of their followers spreading negative but truthful viewpoints on the teaser for this film alone spelt disaster for the heartless Sony company known as Sony Pictures AnimationNow I will admit I have enjoyed a few of their films in the past However it seems as if Sony is following the same corporate rabbit hole as Dreamworks Animation creating quick cash grabs for a safe and significant profit This is a very poor business route for Sony and will in the long run damage their reputation as if it was not low enoughThe only possible ways I could see future films like this rising from hell would be from other heartless corporations sponsoring this horrible business practice I fear for the future of excellently animated film concepts ever reaching out of preproduction,Negative

The Matrix Resurrections is an Action  SciFi movie and the fourth movie of the The Matrix franchise in which we watch the two realities come together and Mr Anderson needs to find and follow the correct oneSince I had already watched the trilogy I knew the story behind it but I did not know what to expect from this fourth movie After watching it I understand why a lot of people were disappointed by it and the main reason was that they expected too much The plot was for one more time interesting and it was really nice watching again some of the main characters The interpretations of Keanu Reeves who played as Neo CarrieAnne Moss who played as Trinity Yahya AbdulMateen II who played as Morpheus and Jessica Henwick who played as Bugs were very good In conclusion I have to say that The Matrix Resurrections is a nice movie but if you have high expectations I am sure you will be disappointed,Notr
Inception is what cinema wants the audience to feel and more a dream that ceases to be fake on every conceivable level Its a metafilm that comes full circle with its implications as to what the audience can take away from a truly impactful movie whether all the story was a dream or not whether most of it actually happens until a certain point or whether the story has no right way to interpret itThe story is relatively simple for Cobb hes a man trying his best to clear his name and return to his family in America and he needs to plant an idea into the mind of a media moguls son about to inherit his fathers empire The rest is something else entirely Cobb is a master dreamthief who has inner demons of his own and he keeps these demons at bay even if it means risking the mission at handInception is a blockbuster that has the makings of an art film populating an actionadventure story and making the absolute best of the scenes Nolans given This film has classic moment after classic moment the dreamelevator the rotating hallway scene the carchase the snow fortress and Limbo make for some of the films many golden moments The set pieces are amazing the direction is flawless and the imagery does evoke the sensation of dreaming Nolan makes his films have a beating heart to them and Inception is full of it through and throughInception is the kind of reason that I can say is the reason I love movies From its ambitious story to intricately done characters and setpieces add up to one of the most wellmade films to ever grace the planet This is Nolan at his very best and more Inception gets  goldstars,Positive
The Emoji Movie Where do I even begin Well this Movie is a ripoff of the surprisingly Successful and Good Lego Movie and it is just a movie to make money off of Look ever since The Lego Movie came out and The Lego Batman Movie came out and those  Movies really surprised me I was thinking maybe this can be good I WAS WRONG I dont have any positives for this Movie except one and that is that people will at least stay up for this Movie and not fall asleep and you will be waiting to get out the theater to tell your friends how bad this Movie is So dont see this Movie at all go see another Movie like SpiderManHomecoming again or Dunkirk something else but this This Movie is bad,Negative
Watched this years ago and i STILL have things to say about it  because this movie dishonored the animes legacy harder than any villain ever couldthe only thing evolving was my regretacting so wooden it made the sets look alive It was like watching a middle school play but somehow still sadderwhy did we turn goku into a high school drama rejectthe hair didnt even go blondeoverall dragonball evolution is proof that nostalgia cant save everything and that not all wishes should be granted The anime we love is screaming somewhere,Negative

This was a great movie even for a true Dragonball DBZ DBGT fan The acting was alright Ive seen worse They changed the plot a little but thats what needed to be done and it was set right The effects were awesome I though it was a very goodgenius way to incorporate Dragonball into a live action film and hope there is enough fan base for there to be more wishing for a trilogy at the least As a fan of Dragon Ball and after watching this movie Ive started re watching all the episodes of it all starting with  I hope this isnt the end of the live action version cause it puts a lot of things into a more real perspective I give this film  thumbs way up,Negative
The emoji movie is a generic uninspired film packed with predictable and uninspired jokes You can also expect an unhealthy dosage of terrible social commentary in this action packed memeUs humans made a lot of mistakes started wars mistreated other creatures and made the emoji movie God is probably testing out the wight of different rocks to throw at our planet at this point I hope it was worth the pay check sir Patrick Stewart needed more poop jokes,Negative

Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly blends intense action profound storytelling and unforgettable performances Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of mesmerizing elevating the film to unparalleled heights Nolans direction coupled with Hans Zimmers iconic score creates a dark and immersive atmosphere that captivates audiences from start to finish The films exploration of morality and the complexities of heroism cements its status as a modern masterpiece in the superhero genreNolans visionary storytelling and Bales compelling Batman make The Dark Knight a timeless masterpiece,Positive
Whats going on here At the moment I am writing these words The Shawshank Redemption is rd in IMDbs alltime top I dont think the movie is particularly bad but to rank it even in the Top is a crime against a lot of brilliant film makers further down the Top and even more people whose works dont even appear on the listSo now I ask if anybody can please explain to me  Why is this movies average rating over  Does it appeal to some basic American sense of justice and love of happy endings  Why did more than  people rate it Im pretty sure it wasnt nearly as commercially succesful as The Lord of the Rings or the Godfather with about  votes Did it do well on video in the USAnd if you REALLY feel like watching movies about people behind bars why not give Cool Hand Luke or the  classic Caged Heat a tryI dont mean to demean The Shawshank Redemtion or anything but I just dont get its massive rating Is this one of the most overrated movies of all time Well according to the statistics of this the odds are that you do not think so But would you then please be so kind as to explain it to me Feel free to email me,Positive
the Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him all the other actors perform perfectly this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it I first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it the setting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me iam finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest films ever made in my time and i love it,Positive
Keep your expectations low and youll never be disappointed My expectations were low and this movie was still disappointingThis did not feel or look like Matrix whatsoever This movie was NOT needed at all Just another money grab by warner brosEverything went wrong They should have left this trilogy well alone This ruined it for me not going to lie Just whyUnoriginal unexciting and unfathomable Why someone thought this was a good idea is laughable,Notr

At the request of a friend I went to the cinema with him to watch this movie because we both love vampires and the horror genre What did we watch This vampire film is almost without visible blood and what little is seen is black while the only red blood is in medical bags that are given for transfusion like wtf Next I would describe this film as  super ultra fast action because Morbius is moving so fast that the shots can barely catch it Oh yes did I mention that as Morbius the vampire moves and flies he leaves behind a trace of color like say a character in a fortnite  Wtf Oh yes and the movie has the dumbest ending ever outrageously shortened When the movie ended I couldnt believe it I felt like I was watching a cheap first episode of the series and I expected to watch the next episode right away Bypass this abomination in film art,Notr
Its a great midnight movie I suggest that you watch it and drink at the same time Dont have high expectations for this film Patrick Stewarts poo so Have  shot before going into the theater See it now I love jailbreak because shes a girl Jake Paul is a bad person ITs EVERYDAY BRO WITH THE Disney CHANNEL FLOW  MIL IN  MONTHS NEVER DONE BEFORE,Negative
When I watched the dark knight for the first time I was about  and I had mixed feelings towards it I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after watching and having few knowledge about some critically acclaimed films like the departed  Inception  and Saving Private Ryan After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre It was a game changer for my taste in films It still tops the superhero genre even after  years of its release The only superherocomic book film which comes close to this one is Logan in my opinion So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledgers outstanding performance The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of its exploration towards many themes like human nature dark reality of society nature of lies true and false characteristics and many more Considering other parameters like cinematography background score and screenplay I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolans films So I end my review here thanks for readingRating  ,Positive

This for me and many other people is the greatest movie of all time it has amazing directing it has amazing acting by Tim Robinson and Morgan freeman whoever says that they dont like this movie should never watch another movie again overall the greatest movie of all time,Positive
When i first heard about this movie i believed it was just another hyped up big budget movie i was completely wrong This movie is easily Nolans greatest work of art The acting and script for Inception is stunning For him to make this movie very complex yet easily understandable is simply brilliant From start to finish i was on the edge of my seat along with everyone else in the theater and was extremely pleased with the ending This was the first movie to leave me utterly speechless after leaving the theater This is definitely one movie you should see in theaters I cant imagine this movie not winning film of the year because it is undoubtedly one of the best films of all time,Positive

I went to the theater to please my girlfriend and did not expect anything I was sadly disappointed tremendously Yes that did the trick for me Now I know what is officially the worst movie ever created Just what is this Why Why And it is not even over please please make it stop This movie should be properly classified as a violent crime against my eyes and ears not to mention against good taste in general I guess I do have to admit that the costumes the set and props as well as the CGI artists did a wonderful job but God why did anyone think this was something worth creating Does anyone taking part in it seriously thing that it is good Really Even if Movies are only created for money nowadays and real cinema is dead I demand to be paid for watching this instead What a tremendous heap of garbage this movie is cant even be put into proper words,Negative
It is not that bad as the media describes it it was kinda good to be honest,Negative
It is an entertaining but long movie entry into the Jurassic World Series It is intriguing has good acting and a story that prolonging itself as it can You get to see how Mazie young girl was born why is she so important to the scientists and more dinosaurs as you can predict,Notr
"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time From its exhilarating first frame to its bittersweet last among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated most philosophically profound most narratively complex unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil
Nolans constantly keeps us offbalance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turnofevents so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight then isnt a message but a sensation which comes from the deliberately twisted form you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down
To talk of Heath Ledgers performance is difficult merely because as gigantic as it is it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas
Its not just the best Batman film ever Its not just the best superhero movie ever Its more than a moneyspinner a franchise a comicbook cashin The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it",Positive
I love this movie in every single shot The music is perfect The acting is pretty good DiCaprio shouldve won an Oscar for this role,Positive
There seems to be a lot of hype about this film As I write its sitting at  with an average rating of  Honestly I dont think its that good Heath Ledger is fun as the psychopathic side of the joker but Im not sure hes any more enjoyable than Jack Nicholson  where for instance are the actual jokes Michael Caine just is NOT Alfred  butlers should speak much more correctly than that and the cockney boy just doesnt work for me Christian Bale doesnt seem solid enough as a Bruce Wayne Its a bit more jolly than the Tim Burton efforts  there is at least daylight this time  and the plot twists and effects are decent but I dont think theyre particularly groundbreaking All in all Id say its watchable but I dont expect it to hang around in the top  for too long,Positive
My first Nolan movie and I immediately became his fan after this This movie will make you question and continuously test your thinking If you havent watched it do it RN cause youre in for a thrilling ride,Positive
I dont even know where to begin with this movieI guess Id start off with the writing is so bad I cant believe I sat though the hole movie I almost got up and leftAnd all the jokes are media based which makes sense as it is a movie about emojis but the jokes are so badI am also not a big fan of James Corden so that also made me dislike this movie even moreThe only thing I really like about this movie is that Patrick Stewart voice the poop emojiOver all really bad movie Id only recommend this movie for Little kids,Negative
Its not the best but I feel like its overhated Although a lot of the aspects are heavily based around appealing to the youth and being trendy the movie as a whole wasnt that cringe Some of the scenes were a little funny and smile is definitely one of the most entertaining characters in the movie The story theme is somewhat generic basically being be yourself Giving emojis depth was probably a challenge but i think they did alright though they could have done better for some characters The comedy in the movie could have been better cause some of the jokes and puns are forced but the unintentional funny parts werethe best The movie is very formulaic and does lack creativity in a lot of areas Its definitely not  but  seems reasonable if you enjoy d animation movies or like Pixar movies youll like this movie Edit Hand emoji was probably the worst,Negative
We are having a protest up here me and a thousand other people who died in the cinemas are asking God to kill those who created this movie We need to avenge the suffering of children parents and these  yo toddlers who havent had the chance to experience the real world yet PS No offense to any Christians this was just a joke,Negative
Im not going to be as rough on this as the rest of the users on IMdB are  rating As a matter of fact Ill use a character from the movie to describe it Meh Thats right There was nothing good or bad about this movie It just kind unfolded in front of my glazed eyes over the screen There were a few chuckles but no laughs And those who say its offensive No A poop emoji is not offensive This story stars the emoji misfits Meh High Five  Hacker on their quest to have lives and to save themselves from being deleted from the smart phone They fight against Smiler who runs the emojis with an iron smile trollers and malware bots This movie would have made zero sense less than  years ago and the movie is fading from my memory as I write this review about it Not exciting not boring Save yourself from a meh evening,Negative
A good ride for the last of the latest trilogyl found the long running time didnt go against itthe two worlds of dinosaurs and our own animals living together side by sideplus the old guard of the earlier films mashing together with the younger group makes for an exciting mixas ever the special effects are top notch but Im afraid now that audiences have become complacent about such thingsanother number one film that doesnt own its merit to DC or marvel,Notr
this an incredible film this movie was make feel the happiness this unbelievable years dug in the jail without no body know and abbreviation this is a great movie and this is form a few great movies you will see it in your life and is to be enough the writer was the greatest writer in the world Stephen king Tim Robinson give all he have in this film and Morgan free man he give unforgettable part in his Lief and how was believe the bad and strong officer at the end crying and they take him to punshid him above he did and Tim Robinson pushed the administrator of the jail to suicide after he take all his money this movie i will cant forget it for along time he will be in my memory for ever,Positive
My wife and myself parents of three little kids rarely get to go to the cinema Two weeks ago during our holidays we got my parent to babysit the little monsters so that we can finally get out again Taking a peek into the papers actually real papers I had no internet access   revealed that The Dark Knight was the only watchable movie playing in the small nearby townSomewhat reluctantly we decided to give it a try What the hell we thought we are on holidays anyway why not check a kids movie sorry to all fans of previous Batman movies but thats just what I think of themBOY were we surprised After the movie it took us a few minutes before we both burst out this is one of the best movies I ever saw I wont go into any details for the multitude of excellent comments on this board already presents this movie as it is a MASTERPIECE Especially the performance of the late Heath Ledger Joker was unbelievable posthumous Oscar anyone I actually felt quite nervous and actually even a bit scared during some Joker scenes  something I didnt experience that often in a movie theater And yet we both felt that quite a few lines of his could have been from us Its a must please go watch it either in a real movie theater or in a DAMN good home theater While the special effects in this movie are just what they should be a mere vehicle to transport the message the atmosphere of the movie just wont come over if you watch it on a  monitor with your  headset on  Id gladly pay again to see it one more time,Positive
I fastforwarded through this The problem is twofold One no one cares about the characters They are flat and insipid and any modicum of development is a caricature at best particularly the opening scenes Worse its performed by otherwise very capable actorsSecond Hollywood must stop feeding the myth of the MCU as its generating worse and worse quality all in the name of the almighty dollar There is no resemblance here to a superhero and even if there were story is abandoned in favour of makeup and special effects and a repulsive visage The fetishization of all things MCU is second only to well the second amendment and with  year olds shooting teachers we know how useful fetishes can beStop the MCU,Notr

Oh yes I remember this highly anticipated film Everyone was impatiently waiting for this especially Dragonball fans When it came out and when I looked at it the disappointment I felt was something indescribable Acting at the amateur level tis very below average All characters are generic without personality without enthusiasm Visible attempts to insert some funny scenes that are not funny at all forced commedy A romantic relationship if we can call it that was inserted purely to exist in the story The plot is characterless uninterestingly complicated and moves too quickly without explanation every now and then lots of unexplained things sketchy with lots of holes in the story The only good thing in this movie is the visual effects I must to admit but thats not nearly enough to save the rest of the film,Negative
This is the type of movie that makes you wonder how a movie studio can mess things so badThe film looks like it was written by a  year oldEvery Sony  Marvel movie feels like it was produced by executives with absolutely no knowledge about the source material character development nor basic narrative trying to implement in a movie what they shallowly believe people wantSony should sell all these characters rights to Marvel and thats it,Notr
Imagine having your name attached to this movie Truly awful The dialoged was cringe the SFX were awful and the plot was so stupid I couldnt believe it Obviously this is nowhere near the original thats a given but this is also so much worse than the previous two Jurassic World movies It didnt even entertain me accidentally or ironically I only finished it because I wanted to see if I could withstand it mentally as some sort of confidence building trophy for myself Kinda like that scene in Planes Trains and Automobiles where Steve Martin goes off on Del in the hotel room How can you stand it Because Ive been with Del Griffith,Notr

The movie is about manipulation of dreams and how it can impact a persons psyche Caprio in this movie is a kind of dream terrorist who as a profession extracts information from peoples mind This is espionage of new times and he has become notoriously popular for this However for the last time when he undertakes a job of planting an idea into the mind of an heir to a giant business empire Cillian Murphy  things go wrong I am disappointed by the script The movie is conceptually flawed First of all how can you dream inside a dream I mean how one transitions into next level of sleepiness Even if one could why the machine used to coordinate the dreams also appears the same in the dream and works also Why one would age in a dream I thought in a dream the appearance of oneself is the mental projection of the memory of oneself Same genre has been portrayed by Paprika beautifully and is much more consistent and meaningful than this version of a dreamcontrol fantasyFirst act was a bit interesting but the plot goes haywire towards the end lost in an attempt to incorporate useless actions scenes Ending was as terrible as one would expect after watching the trifling second act Trying to give an inconclusive end was a bit pathetic after what has been done to original idea There was no original inspiration in this movie By the end of it I was in level Certainly a bad one from Nolan This not nearly as good as Following or Prestige No surreal element twisting the city was a fleeting attempt thoughWatchable once and that too would be worthwhile only on a big screen,Positive

OK here goes Ill prepare myself for an ass kickingI finish watching this film thinking are you guys really watching the same film as me Does this film really deserve  out of  st sept I found this film incredibly frustrating So I guess at the start you learn what a cool concept the film is based on Nice idea Very interesting So why take over hrs to get to the point I fell asleep twice whilst watching it and still managed to catch the end  not feeling that id missed anything importantI didnt really like the characters In these films you tend to connect with as least ONE character but I didnt feel it here at allSo some of you like the FX Yeah that ONE scene they used in the trailer The one they sold the film onOh yeah The last ranti cant stand films where they introduce rules and details that only apply in the next few scenes It so annoying and predictable They do that a lot in this filmSo anyway I left asking myself and the other people I saw this with why this film is so overrated and there are a lack of bad reviews about it We concluded its one of these trendy films that are meant to be clever and intelligent I think people will be afraid of saying bad points about this just in case it suggests that they dont understand the concept I for one did understand it I just didnt like it I certainly dont think it deserves  out of My suggestionjust go and rent Matrix or Minority Report or something like that Clever visually brilliant AND enjoyable,Positive
I really have no words to describe the major fail that this production director and screenplay have madeI grew up reading the mangas of DB and DBZ and watching the cartoon series I seriously cannot believe that the DB franchise have sold this name to produce this who said yes to thisI SINCERELY HOPE THAT THIS MOVIE WILL BE ERASED FROM THE DB HISTORY AND IN NO FORM OR WAY TO BE CONSIDERED NOR RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL DRAGONBALL SERIESApart from that if u want to watch a mediocre action movie go see itFor free Though BTW a dragonball MOVIE made by SQUARE STUDIOS just an idea,Negative

The opening sequence which most people have seen online due to the footage being shown on some trailer reels sets the stage for the entire film An eerie score brilliant directing and spot on acting There isnt too much that I feel comfortable saying about this film that hasnt already been said a thousand times and wouldnt give anything away I will tell you that The Joker is incredible The trailers thankfully dont really give away too much of Heath Ledgers incredible acting so I recommend seeing it for yourself A lot of people are complaining about the length of the film but the film covers a lot of ground and shortening it would be murder Go see this while you can its a classic and raises the bar for all super hero films,Positive

The world of superheroes has always been captivated by largerthanlife characters but none have left as indelible a mark on pop culture as the iconic Dark Knight Batman a character beloved for his complex persona and thrilling adventures has been brought to life in various mediums but with the latest film its clear that the Caped Crusader has found a new home on the big screen The  Batman film directed by visionary filmmaker David Fincher is a visual masterpiece that brings this iconic character to life in ways that have never been seen beforeFor someone like me whose introduction to Batman came through animated series and comics this film was a thrilling revelation I was initially drawn to the character through the brilliant Batman The Animated Series and various comic books However seeing Batman in a liveaction setting enhanced by stateoftheart visual effects VFX was a gamechanger The film takes the characters appeal and magnifies it creating a cinematic experience that is as thrilling as it is visually stunningThe supporting cast is equally impressive Selina Kyle portrayed by a charismatic actress embodies the complex and enigmatic Catwoman Her chemistry with Batman is palpable and their dynamic adds depth to the story The film also introduces a formidable antagonist in the form of the Riddler played by an actor who brings a chilling and intellectual malevolence to the character The way the Riddlers elaborate puzzles and clues are woven into the narrative keeps the audience engaged in a thrilling and suspenseful mystery Whether youre a longtime Batman aficionado or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City this film is a mustsee Batmans legend has never shone brighter on the silver screen,Positive
can not call themselves dragon ball fans cause if u paid any attention akira had say in this movie and he said it was his new imagining so get over it cause it was a great movie and i hope they do make more ill watch em and buy them all to add to all my db dbz and dbgt dvds so everyone needs to stop being so critical about it cause your never going to get a perfect adaptation of any game movie or book so accept it as it is go in seeing it as a new beginning to a wonderful series and enjoy it and i bet you will see it for the great movie it is then what you think it should be if you want your movie buy a video camera and try making one better then this movie,Negative
like The Shawshank RedemptionThe Green Mile is another case of a Stephen King story which translates well from the page to the screenas in Milethis movie is also directed by Frank Darabontwho also wrote the screenplayanother similarity is the prison setting and the fact that the movie is seen and told through the eyes of one man Morgan Freemanwho just happens to be a prison lifer and the things he sees as the years go byhe tells the story of one man who becomes a prisonerTIm Robbins and who he becomes friends withthe movie then chronicles their friendship and struggles in the prison systemunlike The Green Milethere is no mystical or supernatural element to this filmhoweverthis film is of the same calibre of Mileowing to its solid writing acting and directionShawshank is very dramaticyet very compellingits also a very moving taleit will likely impact you emotionally and intellectually and before i forgeti must also mention the endingwhich i thought was very strongfor meThe Shawshank Redemption is a strong ,Positive
I cannot possibly realize why this movie is rated in top movies There is nothing new in this film and there isnt anything in it that makes it special Wake up people Quote Bill Hicks Piece of ShtOK Ill give it that there isnt anything to complain about the acting or directing etc But this entire movie seems to be a compromise I also think that the success of this film is based on the least worst principle and that makes it badIm also fed up with the narrator and all the dramatic film music All this seems like fishing Oscar nominations Am I really the only one who can see how transparent this is I doubt it so please vote movies that really will make difference,Positive
The first one is still by far the best story of them all and this one has a story I wasnt particularly interested in but Id feel like a total heal to rate this any lower than a  due to the effort that went into creating the incredible special effects If it wasnt for those this would basically put you to sleep and I did find myself nodding off during one of the few moments lacking much action But go into this to admire the artistry in the movie making itself and I think youll enjoy the experience That said I sure hope they dont make another one because there is no more story to tell and theyve reached the peak on dinosaur action,Notr
First of all its a musical Theres supposed be more singing than dialogue I think everyone from Elba to Hudson  even Ian M  did a very nice part in their roles And I dont see how yall think actors are creepy when they used the same tech for the Naavi of Avatar and they are supposed to be acting catlike hence where the set has to be larger than normal and the name of the musicalmovie  Unless you thought the Naavi were creepy too And no Im not bashing Avatar I loved that movie and yes its better than Cats I am just talking about the black suits with the cameras so they can capture the actors movements and facial expressions while they add the CGI To each his own though I guess Im the horrible cat for liking this more than the rest ,Negative
A passable film as far as visual effects are concerned but the story and characters are both underwhelming For me it is the worst film of the saga it does not reach the sufficiency,Notr
Can watch a million times and still enjoy every moment  always something new to catch every time I watch plus the actors and actresses are ,Positive
I dont need to see it to know Ill hate it Piccolo wasnt a king and didnt wear a crazy black space uniform  Goku knew of Roshi long before he was a teenager  Goku already knew how to use his powers before he was a teenager  Im also fairly sure there wont be a flying nimbus or a power pole I may be wrong on some of these points I havent actually seen the movie and i wont until it comes to DVD but still the TV trailer and theater trailer looked to be horribleway to ruin my favorite childhood show selloutsEPIC FAIL,Negative
People DO NOT listen to the people that gave this film  It might be obvious that those guys must be paid by Sony to rate this So try managing your review setting so you can avoid them But if you want to YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED,Negative
I dont even know where to begin on how this film messed up a great animation series This movie didnt even touch the show in anyway other than the names of the characters  moves This is the worst depiction of DragonBall Fox has to do better Try again get characters that fit the roll And who actually look somewhere near the characters If not that Give the characters their original personalities I think k this was half asked and not cared about at all Total waste of time  money went into this film,Negative
Excruciatingly bad Its proper rubbishBased on the reputation of this I knew it was going to be utter tripe I always wait to watch myself to form my own opinion but there is no doubt about it  The Emoji Movie is truly awful Its such a lazy attempt there is absolutely no creativity and there doesnt seem to have been that much care put into this How about that product placement alsoI will say I do like the idea you could probably create a fine film with it However man did they get the execution incredibly wrong Thats also not good given the cast performances all of which are quite pathetic In fairness they dont exactly get much to work withIm someone who likes James Corden but he is terrible here As is TJ Miller while Anna Faris and Maya Rudolph are forgettable I was disappointed sorta not to see more of Patrick Stewarts character given how much Ive heard in recent years hes barely in itIts a painful watch even with a run time of just  minutes,Negative
This is one of the worst dinosaur related movies ever This movie is like bland mashed potatoes and analy destructive spicy food at the same time It feels like they made this movie for brain dead people and they filmed this only on Monday mornings when all the people involved had a hangover,Notr
Truly unbelievable they had the nerve to release this They reenact the majority of scenes from the trilogy primarily the original movie and also physically show footage of the original numerous times Pathetic it really is pathetic Im tired of this repetitive mediocre garbage with seemingly every new movie of the past  or so years the lack of effort and quality is beyond sad I barely go to the cinema anymore as of a few years ago due to total nonsense being on and I think this was my last cinema visit ever unless I can be sure its even remotely worth the money,Notr
Looking at how zestfully it demonstrates a broad variety of dinosaurs draws forthright references to some famous scenes from the erstwhile features and also the fact that they bring the original cast back speaks a lot about their intentions thus I can safely tell that more than anything Jurassic World Dominion is a movie strictly made for the fans and fans only Since this was presumed to mark the denouement of this decadelong franchise this was rather an obvious decision from their end to bank upon the element of nostalgia for one last timeNot that Im complaining though as a fan of Jurassic Park and these wondrous critters in general I couldnt have asked for more to be honest Yet my biggest complaint is that amid all this flashiness and showboating the makers for whatever reason forgot to look after the core storyline The plot is quite unstable it is indeed inconsistent and is certainly plagued with an awful lot of expositions and pointless maneuvers Most importantly it doesnt seem to provide any of the thrill or the suspense a film of this stature requires or rather insists upon,Notr
I enjoyed watching the ice cubes melt in my drink more that watching the film,Negative
Some people left before the movie was over wish I would have Horribly done,Negative
"Although I am a big Broadway musical fan and have heard the soundtrack of Cats many times I never knew the full plot It was nice to go into the movie being familiar with the songs Since I was familiar with the songs I did note that some songs were not what they could of been but overall they were very entertaining and even moving During one song I started off a little disappointed but by the end of the song enjoyed it very much At a few points near the end I got emotional and had chills The plot line was very understandable for those who have never heard of it
If you enjoy musicals dance numbers and Broadwaystyle solos the movie is worth your time It was a movie I would watch over and over and recommend to friends Actors did a phenomenal job and obviously Jennifer Hudson was amazing Quite a few new actors who did a wonderful job as well Excited to see where they go in the future",Negative
Solid one of ten for tons advertising in kids movie really apps and services only for  copypasted scenes from other movies like Barbie Video Game Hero  witch is Candy Crash scene for ex and also we have here very harmful idea emojis actually replace real human interact between two kids and at movie says it was good clearly NOT bad Maybe creators hate kids and living human communication  I dont know but I know this is not a movie for any kids,Negative
Having no idea of and no interest in the original anime upon which this spinoff film was based I sat down hoping for a mildly diverting Asianinfluenced fantasy saga What I got was a soulless cashin with pitiful production values an absolutely abhorrent script and an overreliance on cheesy CGI effects over the niceties of quality acting characterisation or plotThe cast are abysmal and I had to feel particularly sorry for Chow YunFat whos utterly embarrassing in the expositionary role of the wise old monk Emmy Rossum once showed promise as PHANTOM OF THE OPERAs Christine but this type of movie is NOT a good career move As for Justin Chatwins lead well hes just a spikyhaired prat Elsewhere theres an endless combination of leaden dialogue and terribly OTT fight scenes between mutating monsters and humans with superhuman powers Director James Wong once produced THE XFILES and directed two FINAL DESTINATION films but on the strength of his work here Id say his talent has long since left him,Negative
At first I didnt think I would like this movie because of all the bad reviews it was getting but I actually enjoyed it It was really cute and I connected with the characters and actually felt sad and happy during the different scenes I think this is a great family movie and is worth taking a chance on,Negative
Just try and make it through just the trailer Then think about how many people in the world could have been helped by that money Think about how many people may need therapy if they manage to sit through this feline disaster I always held Slime People as my nominee for worst film ever made budget was  in  but this has replaced it,Negative
This was just Holy crap where to start This film was so bad I think a visit to the dignitas clinic would be much more fun then this abomination,Negative
Never seen it as a musical but can see it might be better on the stage Remember George Galloway in Big Brother as awkward as that So wrong No story  people of  in the cinema left after  minutes the rest of us stayed to see if it got better it didnt,Negative
There was some movies who I turned off in the middle of it This one was super bad but somehow I managed to watch it till the end Still one of the worst I ever saw,Negative
The original trilogy was coherent unlike the current iteration The plot was confusing jumped around and the first hour was forced boring and did not do much to set the tone mood or anything else regarding the plotCould have easily been a good movie if everything wasnt forced and there was some semblance of a timeline,Notr
A terrible movie Everything is so wrong with the film It is really bad It feels so off and poorly made,Negative
The other  below reviews say it all in short this is a incoherent mess But this abomination of a film puts the exclamation on the state of todays movie making which is in the gutter Why are so many awful scripts like this one getting green lit Doesnt stop there insert obvious covid stricken production lackluster directing wooden acting woke identity politics terrible editing incoherent and boring storylines that make you want to walk out halfway through Not too long ago Hollywood gave us Joker a masterpiece not to mention it made tons of cash People want to go to the movie theater to be entertained not insulted with garbage,Notr
This is the future comic book adaptations are headed THEN WATCHMEGO What a sucker punch I had such a big hopes mostly because of the hype created by people who invested millions into this flop that it really hurts me to say the biggest disappointment in  was this movie Although I still cant say it was the worst There is nobody I can warn about this movie since I was probably the last person to see it on the earth ButMan to see a great franchise falling this low Millions of dollars spent on this movie could have ended the poverty on this world and I couldnt see anything to justify the spending For example the batcave in this movie is an undecorated plain underground garage Fhuy Batman costumes always were lacking behind other super heros outfit however for what they used here I have to admit I seen better on some kids showing up at my doorstep for Halloween Not to mention it was so uncomfortable that Christian B couldnt even move properly in itheck he couldnt even speak properly in it so all the fight scenes were TERRIBLE hidden in dark or under a stroboscope light How about the gay cowboy licking his mouth every  seconds scary try Retarded No offense Imitating raw home made camera footage once invented by Blair Witch Project in a Newsbreak part was when I almost smashed my TV Again where the money went in this filmIll tell You where Paying all the critics for a few favorable words Shame on You HollywoodSure Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher versions were OverTheTop ButMan did I love their use of colors and mood it was a visual treatDark Knight was it a bad movie No it wasnt Disappointment You betchaaLong Live Jack Nicholson,Positive
A feel its going to take a long time until a will recover from this abomination Might need some professional help to remove this from my memory,Negative
The emotions the plot originality everything tied together so well at the end  normally I criticise the way movies end but this ending was phenomenal not cliche at all The brutality of the prison was well portrayed and made me feel sorry for the charactersAll the characters were believable and had depth and none of the scenes were dramatic but there was tension throughout the film Im going to stop fangirling now but this movie is my favourite tied with the Godfather,Positive
Not perfect but too good Definitely the best superhero movie made till now,Positive
The only credit I will give this movie is that at least it doesnt do to Neo what Disney did to Luke in the Star Wars sequels Other than that the film is a dud The costumes are weak The sets are bad The fights are boring The new Agent Smith and Neil Patrick Harris are forgettable Its not as bad as XMen Three The Last Stand or Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull or the Star Wars prequels or sequels but its forgettable,Notr
They should make another Disaster Artist movie out of this movie,Negative
When I first watch this movie I was just shocked with its twist Im not gonna mention details because cant share any spoilersSimply this movie makes a complex story that makes you question so many things Why he is keeping her in his dreams or whatever your question is answering with some well written line That scene is the key to the whole movie That line between Cobb and Mal answers all your questions at onceThats why I like this movie so much Some movies has that potential Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence Youre waiting for that line for whole content But most of the contents I mean movie or TV Series are not managing that wellBesides the greatness of the storyline this movie has a really great cast So Acting Performances are also great Award Winning Cinematography by Wally Pfister was too great Original Scores by Hans Zimmer was brilliant Visual Effects are unique So not only the Screenplay but nearly all the technical details are great,Positive
"Drama adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webbers long running and very successful stage play Ive never seen the sage play so wasnt familiar with the plot and didnt know what to expectI liked most of the music dancing and the cinematography However my wife who is not a huge fan of musicals said she was quickly bored by the amount of consecutive musical scenesIf you like musicals youll like this
If you like dance youll like thisI dont understand how this is attracting so many poor reviews you might like given a chance but if you blindly follow the opinion of professional reviewers then probably best you miss this",Negative
Ill preface this by saying Im not a massive Marvel fan nor am I usually into vampire movieshorrors etc However I had my arm twisted to go and watch this oneI have absolutely no idea why this is getting such low average ratings its currently on  The movie is enjoyable from start to finish the CGI and action sequences are of a good quality and the script is well writtenHonestly  ignore the negative reviews go in with an open mind and youll enjoy the film,Notr
Christopher Nolan will never reach this level of writing its an absolute masterclass of fictionthis will change lives MARK MY WORDS,Negative
I love cat YouTube videos which is what I was doing instead of this cat woman disaster ,Negative
I think someone who has never watched the cartoons or read the comic book needs to chime in A lot of these reviews are rated abnormally low because it didnt follow some story in some cartoon somewhere so I rated it abnormally high to come to the films defenseI enjoyed this movie for its entertainment value and because I didnt have any preconceived notions I wasnt expecting much going in and was pleasantly surprisedJustin Chatwin was excellent in this movie He is a extremely capable actor who did a great job giving the lead role character and a cool personality Chow Yun Fat did a great job as well giving the classic mentorsensei role a great twist and humor you dont see in most cheesy video gamecomic book based movies Jamie Chung who is absolutely gorgeous IMO was reason enough to watch the movie Her action scenes alone were much more realistic and believable than anything in that god awful wirefu Chun Li movie,Negative
This is the work of a true maestro I have never seen anything like this its art in its purest form This movie is beyond unique Christopher Nolans mastery of filmmaking is second to none He is literally one of the best filmmakers the best imo of all time without a doubt and he proved it with The Dark Knight in  and cemented it with Inception in  Both of them are counted among the greatest movies ever createdInception is the most innovative and incredible scifi showcase in the history of cinema I cannot even imagine the thought process that went into creating such a concept which is so incredibly complex Nolan perfectly crafted a world of his own which is so mesmerizing that it feels completely real Everything about this movie acting writing direction background score and character development is bloody top notchIf you watched Inception in an IMAX theater youre one of the lucky ones Long story short you cant skip this movie and say that you love cinema Inception is an experience one that you cant afford to miss,Positive
Frank Darabont directed this superb adaptation of the Stephen King novella that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne a young banker who was wrongfully convicted for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend Upon arrival at Shawshank prison in Maine he keeps to himself mostly causing no trouble though does befriend longtime inmate Red Reddingplayed by Morgan Freeman who teaches him the ropes of prison life though the unwanted attentions of degenerate inmates pushes poor Andy to the edge of despair until his financial skills as a banker prove most useful to both the corrupt Captain of the guardsplayed by Clancy Brown and corrupt wardenplayed by Bob Gunton until Andy hits upon a most clever escape plan Now legendary film that sits atop the IMDb best film list is indeed a worthy filmthough not my pick Still done with remarkable skill on every filmmaking level Could be viewed as an allegory of Christianity but is indeed an uplifting story of friendship and the human spirit Supporting charactersexcept for the one played by James Whitmore arent that appealing but arent intended to be either Perfect ending as well,Positive
Bad writing full of cliches some scenes are just plain stupid The expectation from title or trailer is that this is a postapocaliptic movie set Jurassic Park universe but in reality this is bad spy movie with dinosaurs as motorcycles and rogue agents This is a perfect example of how you could ruin a beloved and nostalgic universe If it was up to me writers and producers of this movie would never get another job in film industry Disgrace All of the stars in the movie cant do anything cant save it There is lack of logic in every event that happens in the movieLike one in the beginning the girl gets scared of the raptor outside the house literally  minutes after she grabs her bike and goes to rideAlso world where dinosaurs and human are roaming the earth is too calm Seems like this movie was made by radical creationists who teach kids that Noah had dinosaurs on his arc,Notr
Im not sure why this got slated as much as it did I really enjoyed it Yes there are better Marvel films out there but there are much worse ones too I enjoyed this far more than The Eternals for example which bored me to tears I also preferred this to Venom but know a lot of people loved thatIm not usually a great fan of the Universal films side of Marvel as they dont seem to be great but for me this was done well and I hope that more films will come from it This has been hinted at with the end credit scenes and I liked what they hinted at so fingers he returns in the Blade movies when they come out,Notr
"This film will stand the test of time 
And it will remain one of the best films ever madePlease do not remake this gem 
It must be left aloneSuperb",Positive
When I first saw the trailer in May I instantly knew the creation of this garbage was a mistake Now I know I was correct The characters are bland the story is clich and the villain is basically like every other clich villain The entire movie just felt like a Wreck It Ralph rip off with emojis instead of popular video game characters The jokes were not funny at all and there was WAY to much toilet humor in this that even a  year old kid who likes toilet humor would be annoyed by it They listed this movie as comedy even though literally nobody laughed in the theater I was watching it in not even some kids Parents spare your children from wasting  minutes of their life and go do something else with that time This movie deserves to become a box office bomb and is not worth watching,Negative
Genuinely a horrific film full of questionable directorial choices but it makes for such an entertaining night at the cinema Didnt stop laughing Awful Worth seeing,Negative
I enjoyed watching this film saw it at the cinema  times and got it on DVD and still watch it now yer it isnt as great as manga but be realistic people there is no technology on earth that could simulate that sort image I think that did good with this film and i hope they bring out a squeal cause i will be going to the cinema to see it and get it on DVD as I enjoy these sort of movies and the first one was not disappointing in my eyes all you manga fans have to put that aside when you was the actual movie anyway enough please bring out a number  as im a big dbz fan which I heard they were making squeal but I have searched and searched and found nothing to confirm this ,Negative
Dragon ball evolution do all the things that dragon ball to Dragon ball super cant do it has better soundtrackmusic and the best animation in the powers i think this movie deserve mores than a  instead this should be a  a truly masterpiece,Negative
This film is just a horrible excuse for a fun action flick that happened to have the magnificence of Dragon Ball slapped onto it I honestly dont think anyone who worked on this movie knew ANYTHING about the Dragon Ball manga or anime None of the characters in the movie are anything like their actual characters It also faces other bad problems like bad acting cheesy effects a pointless love interest and a crappy storyline Also the number of fight scenes is unbelievable For a show that has so many epic fight scenes you would think this movie would have tons right WRONGThis movie has like  fight scenes Really I counted But it all comes down to this If you are a Dragon Ball fan dont watch this If your just a normal person looking for a cool action movie dont watch this,Negative
It was really a beautiful movie in the genre of mystery and action which keeps the viewer glued to the TV Batman was a person with character Joker played one of the best negative roles in the world and was seen a lot and won an award at the Oscar cWith this movie you will find a new attitude about cinemaeremonyI suggest that you watch this movie with all its excitement because you are watching one of the best movies in history I promise you Always watching such movies teaches you many positive and negative points and this world needs such movies About Christopher Nolan who is the director of this unique movie there is no more to say because he is an expert director throughout history I hope you enjoy watching this movie,Positive
Watching humanoid cats rub up against each other for an entire hour and half was extremely uncomfortable There was little to no plot and where there was plot it was lost in chaos and disgust There are multiple misplaced silences of heavy breathing and scathing stares JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME COMEDIANS IN THE MOVIE DOESNT MEAN IT IS FUNNY The jokes have poor timing and dont fit with the movies theme Also the cats are creepy and their clothing is inconsistent,Negative
This movie was just hot garbage Id rather watch my dog be put down again on a loop for an hour and a half Just a waste of time,Negative
I love and movies with a Vampire twist Ive loved Jared Leto since My So Called Life so I was more than happy to see this movie Im not sure why so many people are disappointed but I purchased it today and Im very happy with my purchase Ive already watched it twiceI will keep my fingers crossed for a second Morbius even though people are being so negative His character is right the few against the many Good luck Jared,Notr
When someone who has never seen this asks why this is my favorite movie  I never know what to tell them Its the perfect movie its like God decided to allow the creators writers and actors to blend perfectly together  with the end result being the greatest movie ever written The first time I saw it I thoroughly enjoyed it but didnt allow for the intake of dramatic genius to fully set in I have seen it over  times since I first experienced it and now it is impossible for me to watch any scene without getting chills down my spine Frank Darabont should have a day made in his name for his adaptation of Stephen Kings compelling and brilliant story No one could have surmised that allowing for one of the more likable inmates to be killed would make the movie even MORE powerfulbut he did One last thingI just wanted to thank God for allowing them to change the ending to that of a diminishing Robbins and Freeman at the end no words needed,Positive
I couldnt wait to watch this film but boy was it disappointing It was a fantastic idea and yes it looked great However the main problem for me was that the characters were drawn so poorly in conjunction with the visuals that I did not really care what happened to them I loved Momento and The Dark Knight but the crucial difference is that I cared about Guy Pearce and Christian Bale It may be perhaps that I do not rate De Caprio but I could care less about what his predicament was I even tried watching it  times to see if I was missing anything but ended up getting annoyed Visually stunning there is no doubt and an amazing concept but emotionally shallow,Positive
Most beautiful movie i have ever seen in my life i love morgan freeman and tim robins acting in this movie,Positive
Wellhave been sitting on reviewing a film since became a member of this sitenever was quite inspired to type away a few words for a movie I joined only in  so dont go what about The Dark Knight already I love my movies alright But who to break that melancholic joblessness for me but Chris Nolan I wonder if there has been a contemporary director more consistent than him at catering out breathtaking cinematic experience time and again Well he is back after two long years postponing the third batman movie for this one and we here thought It better be good Well we were wrong Whats the word ah Ruddy brilliant it is Nolan has once again got it all rightthe screenplay the editing the cinematography phew breathtaking His grip on the movie is so overpowering that an actor of DiCaprios talent who by the way turns in an exquisite performance as the troubled extractor Dom Cobb still looks just another character driven in a frenzy in a world only Nolan could make so complex and yet so coherent with all its multilayered texture Ellen Page and GordonHewitt turn in good performances while Michael Caine is charming as ever in his short cameo Because I am quite the Cotillard fan I would not comment on her performance lest it be biased In short if you have bought a ticket for this one and I am not counting on that being easy at least this weekend even here in Pune you are in for a couple of hours of a hell of a ride So long and thanks for all the fish Mr Nolan,Positive
Its okay people its not like we needed eyesight to see this catastrophe unfold anyway,Negative
This movie was actually pretty good a lot better than I was lead to believe by the reviews on this site and others across the net I will admit it could have definitely been betterA few details didnt line up with the original dragon ball anime but there were a lot of things that hearken back to its origins which as a fan of the anime I appreciated One must keep in mind that this movie is based on dragonball not dragonball z I feel that the movie main story is very similar to the original story without just flat out reproducing it And the effects are astoundingThe one major problem I have with it is that the fight scenes arent long enough I say that if your a dragon ball fan you should see the movie and look forward to the sequels which are rumored to already be green lit,Negative
This movie is a complete disaster Along with Street Fighter is one of the worse movies Ive seen in my whole life I never watched a full episode of the original series but Ive seen parts of it This movie destroy the series How can it be so bad Well in my opinion the director never watched the series either I saw this film with some friends and we were laughing at it though its not a comedy The special effects were lame and so the actors If it had been take seriously maybe it would really be a good movie to watch in DVD This movie can be only watched during a day of winter you are locked only one channel is working on your TV and its TNT So if you dont want to waste time of your life please dont watch this,Negative
No this is not the worst CBM ever no this is not even the worst Marvel movie ever Fantstic Elektra Ghost Rider  etc Looking at YOU I wouldnt recommend for someone to go out of their way drop everything and go see Morbius but I believe from the performances given by both the leads the action sequences good CGI  predictable but OK story  its worth checking out for a night out,Notr
Saying this is the  movie of alltime is like saying McDonalds makes the best hamburgers Theyre both palatable predictable inoffensive products that are easy to digest Both have happy endings that is if you find the stunning speed with which a McDonalds hamburger flushes out your digestive tract to be a happy occasionAll you need to know is that Shawshank has the exact same ending as Trading Places So why not make Trading Places the greatest comedy of alltime What the hell why not make it  on IMDb It too is competent and utterly middleofthe road in terms of quality and originality within its genreInstead of Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy laughing it up on a Caribbean beach after besting the forces of evil we get Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins Its the exact same ending Shawshank was OK when I saw it when it came out But count me among the backlash group that would rather see it with the  rating that it deserves Thusly I hereby cast my symbolic star vote,Positive
In a short word  a masterpiece  awesome  mind blowing  must watch film ,Positive
I am being generous giving this a  rating Absolutely pointless movie The originals were fantastic this should never have been made There is nothing original about this movie I think a dentist appointment is less painful,Notr
Its okay they definitely didnt ruin it but it definitely didnt live up to the hype The fight scenes were nowhere near as epic as the others and the ending was awful but its worth a watch I grew up with the matrix movies and have always been a big fan but they just missed the mark If youve never seen the other movies youll probably really enjoy it and prior knowledge isnt really needed,Notr
Had a hard time staying awake through this movie Its just what one would expect from a sequel made nowadays to movie franchises which are more than  years old Lots of nostalgia lazy script boring story Its just milkingSome parts of the story was kind of interesting But most of it was too boringNostalgia bait scenes were meh Same with the meta stuff I dont know how adding meta stuff makes the movie any entertaining Action scenes too were just meh Nothing Id remember after a day or twoThis was definitely an unnecessary sequelMaybe if you are a fan of all the three previous movies which I doubt you may like this one,Notr
This is a total butchering of what I had held great hopes of seeing The movies attempts to follow the dragon ball story line meanwhile adding a modern spin on it ie chi chis castle and Master Roshi lives in a regular semi whats up with that What the viewers want to see is a storyline that follows the cartoon series without any changes and additions Overall the plot is weak the characters do not look like the cartoons ie Yamcha Master Roshi the D cartoon series had better special effects than the movie and the series had NO special effects thats how terrible it was I created an IMDb account JUST to comment on how they butchered Dragonball for me and I hope that Hollywood is smarter next time as to when they bring such a strong fan based series onto the big screens or they will only infuriate more of the audience,Negative
Let it first be known that for every movie that has ever existed I have never wrote a review for any one of them on this website Up until now that is Im sure youve read the other reviews on this website so I feel theres not much else to be said But since this movie was so bad so terrible so fundamentally flawed that it offended me to the very core of my soul and has left an irremovable blotch upon it I felt obligated to give this movie the worse possible rating I could on the first movierating website that I could find I awoke this morning screaming from nightmares frantic to help the cause in making this movie the most infamous in all the four corners of the omniverse due to the great injustice to the sense that this abomination has scarred me with I will say this once and I will say this nowDONT WATCH THE EMOJI MOVIE,Negative
The Emoji Movie is about the Meh emoji Gene played by talented actor TJ Miller It has everything youd want out of a movie conflict good characters engaging story and a happy ending Without spoiling this masterpiece I can tell you that Gene goes through an epic adventure where he grows as an Emoji I dont have any kids because I hate them but the kids in the theater seemed to enjoy themselves even after I accidentally spilled my soda on them hahaha It is definitely worth a watch if you ask meYa boi Tony,Negative
Ive watched Morbius at least  times this day and I still love if so much I want to have deep passionit Physical relationships with Jared leto because he is Daddy I wish I could help him out the washing machine,Notr
The movie frustrates me The fight scenes are boring and very short I was expecting huge explosions tight budget It would have been better to cut the scenes in school as I dont really remember much of Gokus life studying or probably I just missed them shown on TV Gokus transformation into an ape was poorly done I like Emmy Rossum as Bulma she did well Chatwin was alright I think the movie should have to be reshoot better fight scenes extreme power for destructions that is what Dragonball was known for The movie failed to make me a part of it as I wasnt really seeing myself immersed and wanting to see more My eyes riveted on the screen hoping to see more but the movie was just it has it can offer it made me unhappy I wont recommend this movie this should have just been put on the shelves for TVcable viewing,Negative
I do not recommend watching this movie because it just made me throw the phone out of the window When I see an Emoji I felt bad for the future generations because when you published this movie you proved that there is no hope left on earth and you have opened the gates of hell when this movie was published What is the next movie going to be The Snapchat Movie The rise of the Hotdog filter Also this movie is the reason why Ive lost the will to live If you have  for a ticket for this movie just spend it to cancer charities so cancer like this gets cured and nobody has to watch this  This movie was a crime to the humanity and whoever did this movie should be thrown in jail immediately,Negative
I watched Morbius to humor my inner desire to see a movie that was so badly thrashed by social media To be honest the movie wasnt really that bad but it just didnt make sense and left more to be desired for in terms of complexityThis feels almost like an unfinished movie or like a script that was based on several different iterations of editing there were so many details that left me confused and not understanding howwhy things were taking place The plot is more like something that you would see in a VERY early super hero movie where things dont need to make sense they just need to be surmounting the viewers expectations I found myself laughing at how absurd parts of the plot were when I was explaining the movie to those who had not seen itSave yourself the time and dont watch this movie,Notr
Given the all the negative reviews from users and critics I wasnt expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did I have read TSEliots Old Possums Book of Practical Cats twice And I have seen the stage musical  or  times in the s and loved it But a movie gives you closeups of facial expressions and feline interaction that is not visible on a live stage The music was as I remembered with a few additional songs and some spoken parts to help the narrative The actors dressedCGId as cats is no more unexpected than they were on stage I dont deny that people who are not at all familiar with the book nor stage production may find the appearance of the cats to be unusual and the songs somewhat disconnected However I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it and watch it again,Negative
Jurassic World Dominion is a messy but fun movie Seeing the old and new cast and characters interact was just awesome but the many plotpoints get overwhelming at times and make it hard to follow along with the story The dinosaurs dont really get the spotlight as the movie has a Political Theme going on with life living with the Dinosaurs The size and scope is the biggest weve ever gotten from a Jurassic Movie spanning to different continents and locations which makes for some fun scenes with Dinosaur Chases and Dinosaur Overall not what I had in mind to be the epic conclusion to the saga but still enjoyable So as the tagline for this review I have to call it fun but really flawed It didnt bore me in any way and I was still able to enjoy the movie and have fun with it but it had a HECK TON of Problems,Notr
After all these years the first Matrix is still the best movie in the series but if you liked Matrix  and  then you wont be dissapointed The story was interestingalthough it was more like sidestory when compared to trilogy i liked all the nostalgia stuff and callbacks to previous films the humour was suprisingly well done and it didnt feel insulting to the series and i think they explained a lot of what happened since the trilogy took place really well What i didnt like was the action scenes because come on  Its MATRIX  where almost everything is possible they could be a little bit more creative Neo could be more creative,Notr
Many people may think why to write the th review of the same film Well because something is needed to be pointed out Inception is NOT Paprika Ive seen both films recently Inception just yesterday and its plot is completely different Yes they share the aspect that one person can enter someone elses dream Paprikas spoiler and even shared dreams to an extent but the development the goals of the characters the scenarios not just the look but its use and the plot are completely different Were facing two films with their respective strengths and weaknesses I think theres so few left to speak about Inception but to say that everything on it was carefully designed and filmed Its definitely the work of a genius that will stand a top with others SciFi genre classics Keep up the great work Mr Nolan Youre from now my favorite director,Positive
If there is one thing I would wish to unsee it would be this movie I was prepared for it to be bad but thought it could therefore be somewhat entertaining I was wrong,Negative
It is not a masterpiece it doesnt make much sense and most scenes are just too ridiculous and convoluted to appeal a wide audience but come on people its a musical about cats having a party to decide who goes to the afterlife it sure is no Citizen Kane but in order to enjoy it you have to put your rational mind aside,Negative
This movie is a sad defecation on Sony Pictures It is not just a sad defecation it is a cashgrabbing dump on modern society The Popeye Movie idea was cleverly put up with great wordplay But this copypaste thing that copies WreckIt Ralph and Lego Movie does not deserve to be reviewed but I had to reluctantly do so Gene is a meh emoji who does not have a filter and he would make the wrong face Gene  Emmet One scene references WreckIt Ralph Hi is the worst comic relief Ive ever seen Scrappy Doo PFFT What does he have against the Hi Emoji Jailbreak is Wyldstyle and Smiley is Candy King or Lord Business This film was so predictable and rotten that it got a  on IMDb This overtakes Adam Sandlers Jack and Jill as the rd worst movie in my Worst Movies List On the plus side The voice acting and animation is well done but did they really have to make this bad,Negative
Emoji is a film that revolves around the world of emojis and attempts to create a story from it Unfortunately the film falls flatThe films plot is shallow and predictable lacking creative ideas and a compelling story to engage the audience Instead it feels like a marketing ploy to capitalize on the popularity of emojisThe characters are onedimensional and clichd offering little development or opportunities for the audience to connect with them The dialogue is uninspired and at times even frustrating lacking genuine substance and originalityThe animation in the film is technically competent but that alone cannot compensate for the lack of quality and substance It seems that the film primarily aims to attract young viewers with colorful visuals rather than tell a captivating storyThe jokes and humor in the film are flat and forced with few genuinely funny moments to make the audience laugh Instead it relies on tired clichs and wordplay that quickly become tiresomeOverall Emoji deserves a rating of  The film disappoints on many levels offering little that makes it worth watching It lacks a compelling plot welldeveloped characters and original humor For anyone looking for a quality film Emoji is definitely not recommended,Negative
Its hard to believe that this film rates in the Top  of all IMDbrated movies Sure it deserves more than  stars on Heath Ledgers performance alone But lets face it This movie doesnt hold a candle to Nolans first Batman effortThere is very little plot There is a whole heckuva lot of brooding There is dark aplenty but to what purpose I got so tired of it I was ready to just have Heath get rid of Batman for once and allThe NolanChristian Bale combo is dynamite but this screenplay and plot is anything butStill there is Heath Ledger and he is really superb What a loss for us all And as always the movie LOOKS great filled with the typical Nolan touches Ive recovered and Im ready for a third NolanBale effort just with a bit more thought to story and at least some measure of action,Positive
Another summer and another summer movie Awesome animation but not for everyone,Negative
It is far form being the best of the Jurassic movies for sure but it is nowhere near as bad as I feared from reading some of the reviews Yes the storyline is not great and the first  minute or so were less than exciting It did however get better as it went on and it was great to see Drs Grant Sattler and Malcolm from the original three films and if one can put the plot weakness out of mind for a time there are some genuinely thrilling and exciting moments in the movie Above all there are the dinosaurs the real stars of the show  and dont they know it We get to see new ones like Baryonyx Allosaurus and Atrociraptor as well as old favourites such as Brachiosaurus Velociraptor and of course TRex without which no Jurassic movie would be complete Yes TRex was from the Upper Cretaceous as were most animals in these movies but just go with it So if you love dinosaurs its worth watching just to see them in action once more especially TRex who never disappoints,Notr
I tried not to let the preposterous build up and hype for this movie influence me before I watched it Im glad that I did that because my expectations really werent that high As a result I enjoyed this film quite a bit Im not sure about its rewatchability but it certainly keeps you interested throughout Its captivating on two fronts One the story itself and two the fear that theres something else going on and that the other shoe could drop at any minute Nolan plays it masterfully There were shortcomings for me however Minor inconsistencies falling kicks were happening every five seconds and shifting between dream world and movie world time frames made it awkward at times Also the action sequences featured that poor shaky cam quality that Ive really come to loathe There was even some poor use of the steady cam on regular shots Minor quibbles aside I loved the theme they tackled and the trippy nature of the film itself Anyone that has lost someone close to them knows the frustration of trying to keep a firm memory and those little nuances of them alive For me the bizarre concept and why they can even do what they do is secondary What carries the film are great performances mixed with an emotional impact mixed with its unique plot angle While not THE greatest thing ever put to film as some may suggest it certain was an entertaining film to say the least,Positive
Mom they posted cringe well cringe are ironically funny but Its disturbing  My EYES agghh,Negative
Great and worth to watch The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made,Positive
Im sorry I cant buy these guys as criminals and that ruined the suspension of disbelief for me Otherwise an excellent story,Positive
After watching this movie I was so disappointed Morbius is a cool character with an interesting backstory personality so on The beginning was pretty solid but it dropped for the rest of the movie The middle has absolutely nothing happening in it and the climax was a confusing battle The fight scene in the climax was very confusing due to not knowing what is going on just a bunch of rubble flying around on the screen Overall this is a terrible movie though it had potential it flopped after the first  minutes,Notr
Satisfying good movie but the only great part of this movie is the magnificent performance by Morgan Freeman An apparently inspired Tim Robbins rises above his very mediocre talent and delivers an adequate performance Hamhanded attempts at profundity in every scene get tiring as is the use of every prison movie device character and cliche in the history of hollywood,Positive
 yes complex ambitious Christopher Nolan and his cowriter Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation I dont usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence The Dark Knight is certainly loud and violent but its not mindless It has depth and soul Even the Joker in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger is deeply human The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself in screen time is not really the lead My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret I believe is his obvious respect for his audience What hes done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions Bravo,Positive
At least Ishtar provided a few laughs I cant begin to understand the thought process Its horrid The biggest problem was the CGI for the fur ears and tails of the performers REAL Cats dont look ANYTHING like these creepy beasts Ears moving randomly and tails looking like awkward phallic objects Idris Elba doing a soft shoe and singing Jennifer Hudson NOT SINGING WELL I wish brain bleach could erase this movie from my mind A horrid awful mess Every aspect of this movie was terrible Survived the cinema experience barely,Negative
Sure it was not the best of the JP movies Jurassic Park and Jurassic World were my favorites But it certainly was not as bad as some of the other reviews stated And it was better than some of the other sequels they have been churning outMy husband and I thought the movie was pretty good my husband often falls asleep during the bad ones and I really enjoyed seeing all the characters from the JP movies come together even if it was near the end I thought that the movie would have been better if it were edited down to  hours it was a bit long I was looking at my watch near the end of the movie and cutting it back would have made the plot tighter and the movie more interesting,Notr
Maybe that was a bit of an overreaction but the movie was just so mind numbingly dull and uninteresting I definitely wouldnt recommend this to anyone,Notr
The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful dramatic and compelling film but despite that Im not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot Who is Batman and what do we really know about him After having watched the whole film all  hours of it Im not sure I could say What are his motives Does he really love Rachel  indeed does he have the capacity to love at all Again hints are given but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him My inability to empathise with the characters wasnt helped by the ridiculous number of subplots most of which are rushed or incomplete and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline and developed the characters and themes within thatThe frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action setpieces whilst initially breathtaking ended up feeling dull and predictable What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker werent enough to keep the film goingAs such I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak joyless violent world I had witnessed and disappointed that this muchhyped film just hadnt been as good as I was hoping it would be,Positive
When I first saw this film I wasnt that Mesmorised but as I thought about it I began to notice its Symbolism The more I thought about it the more I liked it and now it is my second favorite movie Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors of are generation and the thing I love most about him is his voice Tim Robbins is perfect as a quit sincere Andy DufranseThis is one of the best movies ever made and deserves more publicity from critics,Positive
It helped me set a low bar and mediocre expectations for this movie so after I saw it and was both thrilled and inspired by its raw and deeper and practical message I had no option but to give it a  So thank you,Notr
The Dark Knight directed by Christopher Nolan is a cinematic triumph that redefines the superhero genre Released in  it stands as one of the most iconic and influential superhero movies to date Heres a review of this remarkable filmChristopher Nolans direction is impeccable He crafts a dark and gritty atmosphere that befits Gothams grim world The films cinematography with its sweeping shots of the city captures the essence of a modern noir thriller The action sequences are intense and the practical effects add a visceral quality to the filmThe Dark Knight is not just a superhero movie its a deep exploration of complex themes It raises questions about morality the nature of evil and the sacrifices made for the greater good The film challenges viewers to ponder the fine line between hero and antihero,Positive

Lets face it it could be better Not the best Jurassic movie but yet I liked it Im a big fan of Jurassic park and I was really happy when they announced the Jurassic world My childhood came to lifeFor this movie I knew it wasnt going to surprise me but I wanted the end I wanted to say goodbye to my beloved dinos And even it wasnt the best I was pretty satisfied I think we got a lot of closures Maisies origin much more dinos than ever old actors back together and their own moment D and I was really glad for Henry he always wanted to do something incredible and most of time it didnt work but this time he gets his redemption Overall its not the best but it did make my heart flutter one last time Still loves the franchise and I hope for those who loved the original trilogy will find the same satisfactory like I didLife always finds a way this time we were given coexisting world when dinos live with us I dont know about you guys but I was more than okay with the ending like this ,Notr

I have watched this series all the way from beginning to end and I like to think of myself as a pretty big fan of Dragonball Z Unfortunately my excitement over the fact that they are making this sham of a movie turned quickly to disappointment when I watched the first trailer Nothing is faithful to the original series Instead of trying to just put the show onto the big screen for fans and others to enjoy they have warped it into something that doesnt even closely resemble Dragonball For the many people out there who dont know what Dragonall is I feel like this movie is just going to turn them against the franchise In just those few minutes of the preview there are so many inaccuracies that I almost wanted to cry Unfortunately I probably will not go see this movie Maybe in a few years after this movie has tanked spectacularly they will make another that people will actually want to see,Negative
Another case of a film better left unmade just designed to suck money out of people Actors were great story was just a rehash of everything before,Notr
i dont think i even need to describe this to you no one expected this to be the least bit good its copying the whole idea for a movie from WreckitRalph and is using a concept or genre that is questionable within its existence in the first place Emojis However it could have been something SOMETHING at least more than a complete waste of everyones time but its not theres no effort here theres clearly no soul or dedication here either if there was not only would it not be a rip off WreckitRalph but it flat out wouldnt exist in the first place because no one wanted a movie about emojis you can ask people in the street and theyll either be offended that you even thought people wanted the emoji movie or not know what it is some middle aged men wanted to make bank and thought that since the children these days use Emojis practically everywhere theyd make money from every demographic the only thing i want to know is how much they payed Patrick Stewart to be in this  hour long coma dream,Negative

Bringing back the original cast of Jurassic Park works very well in this film and is one of the rare good things about this movie The action sequences are terrific and the pacing of this movie is perfect Some things that didnt work out in this film were its obsession with clich raptor Blue Leave her alone already And the plot itself which was stupid and pointless to begin with Overall its a good film to watch it at least once or twice,Notr
I just finished my review of The Invisible so i thought yeah i should review this tooWhy is it so hard to adapt something to a movie There ARE exceptions a recent case being Sonic the Hedgehog but others like the  Mario film or The Hunger Games just end up being thrashed for often good reasons Dragonball Evolution is not only the worst movie adaptation ever conceived but one of the worst movies of ALL TIME In the history of cinema Granted i never watched the anime but do i really need to see the source material to tell you how bad it is What makes this horrendous is Justin Chatwin He cant act in this It really makes Robbies mysterious reveal at the end of War of the Worlds seem more logical than HOW IN THE H CAN YOU NOT SAY A LINE LIKE YOU MEAN IT AND you dragged Emmy Rossum an actress from decent films like The Day After Tomorrow into this How can anybody sign on to a movie like this There are times DBE tries way too hard and times where it doesnt try at all,Negative

What a joke Please make a new Dragonball Movie with some better characterizations and do it rightStart from Dragon Ball Z if u wish as its the better and if u succeed u can go back to dragonball past or dragon ball gt futureBut u must pick at first the better one like LUCAS did with STAR WARSSo the first movies should have beenFirst Saga Vegeta Second Saga Freezer  Third Saga Cyborgs Fourth Saga CELL FIFTH SAGA BOOO BOOOAnd please choose some better actors Master roshi is bald u bastards Bulma has blue hair etc etc etcThis director should be banned from directing more movies or at least should have been some organization that protect some stories from being told by incompetent people,Negative
After the ending of the last film it left me and Im sure everyone else very excited to see what the action will be like when the dinosaurs will roam the planet Disappointingly there was hardly any action it was so slow and long that I was begging for the film to end Save yourself time and money and avoid this boring film,Notr
It is not possible in  words to explain just how bad this film is it seems theyve completely not bothered to actually do any research into Dragonball or its sequels Z and GT This film completely ignores the source material and is Dragonball in name only apart from character names as wellWhoever wrote the story for this film deserves less respect than Uwe Boll and thats saying somethingIf youre a fan of Dragonball Z or GT I recommend not to see this horrendous steaming pile of crap Next time Hollywood instead of a cheap unrelated cash in try making something decent and stay true to its roots,Negative

To be honest it wasnt so bad the emojis animation looks good but the whole thing reminds me about wreck it Ralf but more lame Because wreck it Ralf has a whole story line and a lot more memes and wider perspective while this movie is only a childish entertainment which is really a bad choice Heres why who do you think will watch this movie Sure adults might understand the jokes inside about internet and stuff but not really and the whole story line is weird and the love between jailbreak and Jean is awkward super awkward If you say this is for kids no because they cant even understand the memes and jokes about internet and social medias its just boring for them And for teenagers Its just lame,Negative
Best movie ever Ive seen it about  times now and it never gets boring,Positive
I saw this movie in theatres with my three kids and I actually really like it I think people are expecting far too much from a kids movie Its fun to watch and much better than I expected Until you have sat through Captain Underpants the Movie you cant possibly know what a terrible kids movie really is My kids all loved it and I liked it enough to see it again,Negative
Neo and Trinity were fine they had no issues in holding the originality of the first three movies but when prime actors like Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne are replaced with inexperienced actors the theatrical attractions is destroyed Its rather obvious that this is propaganda when key words like sheeple are used This movie was a let down in accordance with current degradation of society,Notr
I just dont get it Its not that I think this is an awful movie or anything but no Look at the rest of the movies in the top  Does it REALLY stand comparison with the Godfather or Seven Samurai I think not Its a manipulative sentimental Sunday afternoon movie raised above Bstandard by some quality turns by talented actors Nothing more And who cares whether Andy could put the poster back in place or not Its a patently ridiculous escape to begin with I understand that most of the people on this site will have a pop at me for being a snob but the fact is I love Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and other blockbuster movies But if youre looking for a genuinely affecting drama this doesnt cut the mustard Sorry guys but youre all wrong,Positive
Only really watched Morbius because its connected with Spiderman I didnt have much interest and knew it was going to be bad from the trailers But just how bad is it Well its really just a whole lot of nothingWeve seen this story a hundred times by now Mad scientist experiments on themself and ends up with superpowers But not just superpowers Vampire powersIts basically a combination of all the superhero and Vampire movies weve already seen Except with terrible action scenes that you cant make out for all the bats and rubble that are in the way As well as repetitive use of annoying slow motion and peoples faces quickly morphing into a Vampire face mid sentance Just to remind you that the film isnt boring Theres even a forced unnecessary romance in there for no reasonIt could of at least been average and is almost saved by the decent villian But then theres those tacked on midcredit scenes that just remind you this is all one big con to get you back into the cinema next time Watching something that should have Spiderman in it but doesnt,Notr

If you enjoy reading my SpoilerFree thoughts please follow my blog to read my full review Morbius is yet another disaster from the SonyMarvel shared universeDespite good performances from Jared Leto and Matt Smith and even a couple of visually captivating action sequences the formulaic screenplay that seems to originate from the beginning of the century ruins everything in its pathFrom the predictability and zero creativity of the main plot to the heavy reliance on uninteresting unnecessary exposition Daniel Espinosa finds his most significant problem in the blatant lack of care in the treatment of the charactersThe narrative logical lapses are too many to ignore and even amplified by extremely messy editing a third act wrapped in an unfathomable blend of CGI and a plagiarized scoreOne of the most embarrassing productions by a major studio in recent yearsRating D,Notr

Did not want to watch this movie after witnessing all the  and  reviews My two girls convinced me to watch since they were so persuaded by the trailers The movie was actually better than I expected Most importantly my  year old and  year old truly enjoyed it and came out so happy afterwards Thats what matters most I would personally rate the movie between a   stars however a  is well deserved to try and bring it back up with all the negative ratings This movie really has a positive influence on the childs mind I may even buy it on DVD as well  This movie did have similarities to another movie we really enjoyed  Inside Out,Negative
This movie is one of the best I have ever seen I first read the book and I didnt liked it that much but then I saw the movie And thats a things thats never happened to me before the movie was better than the book Its the other way normally But in this case the movie is so much better I like the end more than in the book Watch the movie it is great,Positive
Avoid this weird and awful mess This will give you nightmares days after you watch this,Negative
I just cannot explain how awesomely awesome this movie is Overwhelming but in a completely good way is a very good word to explain this The actors were all SO fantastic There wasnt one of them that wasnt completely believable in their role The FX were just spectacular and really helps to transport you in to this movie The story and whole concept of this Inception thing and how they do it just totally blows your mind I mean it really does This movie made me feel like I had been sitting on the edge of my seat and holding my breath I could not wait for the next whatever to happen and to see how everything played out,Positive
For starters it was a shambles this is the only newish db movie out and people need to get together and do a MUCH better adaptation of this film the only good thing was some of the beams they fire ie effects but fan made films have done better with looks and better action hopefully one day they make a reboot,Negative
This movie was a disappointment because it could have been great However its not as bad as the reviews suggest The story was interesting for the first half and turned into a hot mess for the second half I could have also done without so much of the CGI because that diminished the film and made it feel cheaper I would have preferred prosthetics instead of the CGI faces because they looked really good for the first half then turned so obviously fake by the second half it was laughable The CGI blurriness when the vampires would move looked terrible I know it was suppose to represent the bat radar but it was distracting I also thought the detectives were pretty pointless to the story and could have been written to make some type of contribution for the climax of the movie It needed to be darker to work with a tone like The Batman However the actors especially Leto did a good job for what they were working with It wasnt terrible just wasnt good,Notr
After watching this movie i was stunned at how great it was It was the first movie that kept me hooked the whole way through and had everything in it What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so well from the original short story which again was very good How anyone can say it less must not have been watching it properly There is nothing to say to criticise the movie the acting was brilliant the casting great and the directing breath taking But we can not overlook the great writer who brought this story to life Steven King Without having writers like him we would never have any movies to match up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather I am still waiting for another movie to knock it off the top of my top  list however i am doubtful if this will ever happen,Positive
Amazing movie by Nolan could not make a more real version of Bats and Joker,Positive

No resemblance to anything related to the franchise Please disregard this mess and hopefully they will make another actual Jurassic park movie to finish the series No excuse for this crap,Notr
Overall the movie is pretty good It starts slow however but then it picks up and shows off some really good action So the pacing does suffer in the first halfChemistry between NeoTrinityMorpheus is certainly there and the movie has a ton of throwbacks to previous parts It cohesively fits into the franchise and production quality is top notch However the ending was quite a disappointment The movie lacked a strong villain and that shows toward the endYou definitely should watch it if you love previous movies,Notr
I finally decided to see this film after reading good reviews and noting that this film ranks in IMDBs top ten list currently  At the very least I disovered where all the noble people are theyre in prisonThe film is decent but it certainly isnt what I would call great or extraordinary There are good performances by Robbins and Freeman but the pace of the movie is very slow and the cinematography is unremarkable Characters are largely stereotypes the story is somewhat formulaic and sometimes ludicrous and the noble prisoners vs wicked guards dichotomy is simplistic and unrealistic I was also particularly annoyed at the narration which always seemed to explain more than it needed to As for the ending I guess I was not as suprised as others since I did read the Stephen King novella many years ago Still given that the story takes place in a prison you dont need to be a genius to guess part of itThis movie reminds me of Dead Poets Society in terms of its tone and theme of uplifting the human spirit against a backdrop of despair If thats your thing youll love the movie Its not really my thing,Positive
I watched it twice as I think every Matrix fan shouldThe first time was in an IMAX theater and I enjoyed it Action scenes were good storyline was good but Im not real sure I was fully following it I left with some questions as to why certain things were done in the ways that they were I had read some reviews before seeing it that first time and I disagreed with some of those reviews and agreed with others but all and all I had enjoyed it enough I then watched it again on HBO MAX and thats when I really enjoyed it I had more of a grasp on the story line and a lot of those questions I had after the first showing were no long there and this were making themselves more clear and I disagreed with a lot more of the not so good reviews Its a fun movie with a smart storyline Im welcoming to another if they chose to do another one Im sure Ill see it a few more times and throw it in the mix throughout the years when revisiting the Matrix,Notr
I dont understand why so many critics  audience members hated this movie so much I dont typically like musicals but I actually liked this The dancing  singing were great I loved the  leads Victoria  Munkustrap whos faces  dancing were captivating to watch Jennifer Hudsons singing made me cry it was so well done I thought the cgi was actually pretty cool  amazing The only actor bit I didnt like was Taylor Swift Yeech she was bad It was like she didnt even try to move like a cat Dont know why some reviewers slammed that the plot made no sense The plot was actually very clear The move kept me entertained,Negative
Heath Heath Heath yada yada yada Yes he did a lovely Joker So what The film was almost as tedious as the rest of them The obvious problems Too long Shallow stabs at moral seriousness Absurdly overprocessed Batman voice The usual barelythere female characters Heaths Joker was just another lunatic villain and weve seen plenty of similar quality over the years gasp  heresyYes in my opinion Heath was merely okayMaking a villainous virtue out of the Joker having no purpose but to make the world burn is not deep Its not that hard to create a charismatic psycho character Yes he had some game Yes of course I enjoyed lines like I wouldnt know what to do with it if I caught one This movie wasnt completely awful Im giving it five stars after all which guarantees no one will read my comment but oh wellBut neither Heath nor the film as a whole was amazingIm not a superhero movie hater and Ive actually read plenty of Batman comics in my life unlike at least half the people getting excited about this film I think But I have been bored and disappointed by the Batman franchise films every time so this is no surprise I cant even wrap my head around this one being fun light entertainment or any other kind of entertainment let alone a classic as so many are calling itA classic As GOB would say Come on If you are calling this movie a classic you cant possibly have seen many movies,Positive

The third and final entry in the Jurassic World trilogy and an overall conclusion to the original Jurassic Park series A satisfying conclusion with lots of entertainment and thrillful moments The best entry in the Jurassic World trilogy and I dont care about the unnecessary hate this film getting and I find it ridiculous because this film made especially for the true Jurassic Park fans,Notr
Best movie ever  if youre looking for perfection  this is itFreedom at its best Morgan Freeman its formidableThe Shawshank Redemption is not a depressing story there is a lot of life and humor in it and warmth,Positive
I have been into movies since well I was  But after about  years I finally was lucky enough to come across this title I had a huge expectation when I started watching itHey it aint number  for show that much i can vouch for Well it took me a few minutes to get into it but well once i got engulfed it was just sheer pleasure and goosebumpsThe film revolves around the inmates of a prison and a NEW FISH accused of homicide joining the facultyThe film depicts How he changed their lives and helped them to realize and bring back the greatest gift of life taken away from them  The friendship the hardship the simplest joy the tragedies  the yearning for freedom in each breath has been brilliantly acted and directedThe movie makes you feel goodAfter watching it it makes you smile and strengthens your faith in humanityI am no critic but this movie made me happy ecstatic and I would love to rewatch it again and again so i would say go on watch it at once if you have not You will love it no matter what your taste in films are Because this film expresses humanity in each way possible And as a fellow human being you will love the emotions If you dont then well I will be a bit surprisedPS  was the year of Forrest Gump It took home all the awards Though it is a great film but in my opinion it remains only great while shawshank is one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all times Thank You,Positive
If you love Christopher Nolan films or films in general you will love Inception heck if you dont like films you still have to see this The acting was top of the barrel Leonardo The Apprentice The Japanese Billionaires and his friends were all incredible in this dream in a dream in a dream flick that will make you wonder and fascinate With gratuitous action and awesome adventure Inception truly is a sight to see that is why Inception is in my top  movies ever and after watching it I guarantee you will place it in your top  minimum Pay the money for the Blu Ray or watch it online Inception is worth your time,Positive
so ii see all these people giving it negative reviews and Im thinking ya maybe they are right but why hasnt any said anything about Krillin not being in this flick is he not a main character in the mangaanime i mean seriously OK i can deal with roshi being a middle aged man and i can deal with goku being a teenager HELL i can even deal with the fact that he is in SCHOOL but please Krillin was his best friend how can you leave him out of the loop if they make a sequel which will be surprising they better not have krillin in it because now it wont make any sense whatsoever to have him in these movies please please please dont make a sequel just make a remake and fix this sheet,Negative
I can understand those who dont like the film as its one for those who have been with Jurassic park from the startI watched them all as they came out and went to cinema and for me this movie was great from a nostalgic point of viewIt was fab to see the original cast and learn how they had evolved over the year and come full circleThere are multiple storylines running along side each other the old versus the new and yet these storylines are all running towards joining the old and the new togetherI watched the extended version and feel like as a fan and viewer Ive been given the perfect ending to a storyline I grew up with,Notr
st of all I give  and  for all those dummies who call themselves fans and who voted that low There are so many overrated movies out there and all those so called fans also overrate tons idiotic stuff Well at least most of them And I bet the lack of their taste is despicable Cmon Maybe that movie did not come out as the best for fans but it was more than okay and watchable for the rest of us who barely seen  or  series of the dragonball anime series The reason that movies like that dont come in nd parts coz of those stupid dummies that call themselves fans Hey you  fans  RATE your socks and compare your wife to them next time you dicede to judge something that you never ever done before,Negative
Is there really no creativity left Is there no shame in releasing such a schmata Is there really no topic one could pick besides retarded emojis Stop Please please stop No more Because if there will be more then the world will turn into a  version of the world in Idiocracy and the next big movies will be called A and the next big TV show will be Ow my balls And it goes beyond movies like this  its as if  big movies that come out are just literally cinematic fastfood  no thought given Literally none at all Just make something,Negative
All you need to do is switch this film on for  seconds and your hooked Simple,Positive
This movie is too long by about  minutes I was happy when the screen finally went dark A filmmaker should be able to get his point across in under  hours or before the collective audience ass starts hurtingIts a comic book and the effects and makeup are really great but still some of it is too inexplicable and so beyond the possible that it undermines the characters The Joker is deliciously strange and evil but if he can arrange those events that are so very complex he starts to look more like a circus ringleader whose dancing dogs and fireworks are the real charactersThe story was very hard for me to follow I dont appreciate having to try so hard to figure out what and why things happen in a movie I am still not sure why Mr Two Face went sour and frankly I didnt care that he didThere is a very heavy thematic effort here much of film is trying to clearly define good vs evil and the shifting ambiguity of that to end with Batman becoming rather dark and isolated I applaud this kind of effort in an action film but here the authors take just too long to get there I was itching to get out of my seat and had to force myself to sit through to the very end and thats not good for any movie,Positive
This is not supposed to be an exact copy of the manga or the cartoonanime The side characters are eh but they are trying to put hours of story in about an hour and a half All and all its entertaining and fast paced If you miss  minutes of this you will be lost The writing of the dialogue kind of sucks This was made and supposed to be the pre journey before dbzish story lines come about The side stuff with Bulma and Yamcha sucks but they had to rush it for the time they had Oh well its supposed to be like DB not DBZ which DB was more for kids and so was this Im sure it will get better Worth a watch though definitely,Negative
Every one is Trashing the Movie for Knowing the plot and expecting how it will end Well Guess what Its a Kids Movie you should get the Idea of the Movie as it tells every Kid to be himherself and they will Turn out greatYou dont need to be a copycat or to be like someone to be successful you need to be yourselfThats a Great Lesson for everyone not just kids The Message that this Movie delivers is brilliant I enjoyed the Movie and all the Kids in the Family Laughed and enjoyed it Specially the Ending Such a cool idea I think the reviews are not giving this movie what it deserves,Negative
 In  we will have flying cars  THE EMOJI MOVIEI cant believe that Sony would create such a horrific film My eyes are forever scarred This movie is an atrocity and is just ad WHERE WAS THE  emoji Its unbelievable that people would pay to see a movie like this I already was starting to believe there was no god but now I know there isnt This movie is the opposite of  Dont spend money on this unless you want cancer,Negative
So everyone is complaining how its this awful movie and that they wish they could rate it  stars but honestly its good I love action movies like this thought it was a lot like wreck it ralph and inside out very funny and actually made me laugh tehe,Negative
A good film but not the master piece every one is making it out to be One word Hype Two face is wasted and his existence is only known by Gordon and batman in the end so why bother using and wastinghis character was there any real point in Maggie Gylenhall The ferry bit went on far too long probably so they could give ledger more screen time The batbikepod thing looked really slow and spent most of its time spinning its wheels and looked like more of an excuse to release a cool toy tie in and i could go on but you probably all agree but are too blinded by hype and the fact that ledgers dead to see that this is a pretty average film Why was the scarecrow not arrested at the start of the film How come the clear reference at the end of batman begins regarding the jokers existence is completely forgotten about in the next movie I could go on but im sure youll all realise when the hypes died down In summery too long wasted characters a bit of mis casting and what the fk was with batmans ultra gruff voice i nearly choked on my popcorn first time i heard him Heath ledger is a sad loss however,Positive
Well I am not surprised by the output of this movie as I did not expect much from it in the first placeThis movie follows the same routine of Jurassic World  and Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom  popcorn movies and nothing moreOut of the  Jurassic Park and Jurassic World movies the very first Jurassic Park movie  was the most exciting and valuable one to watch,Notr
Its a superhero movie I dont know why everyone expects it to be some groundbreaking masterpiece It was enjoyable to watch They kinda forced the villain but no biggie,Notr
Please dont watch this Dont I did It was horrible cringeful just plain bad Stay away from this movie its poison in your veins and will leave you confused and angry There is nothing redeeming in this movie the jokes are horrible the characters are just boring So boring but its not The Room bad Where its a bit funny No this is just so bad its bad There is no other way i can describe this level of bad,Negative
Same old cat and mouse play between our heroes and dinosaurs Doest matter where exactly it can be a facility park island whateverIf you are a bad guy dinosaurs will attack you and catch right away but if you are from the main cast group they will circle around you for hoursSo story and writing havent been able to develop at all Same formulaCasting and acting was only for nostalgia Yes it was nice too see old and young generation together but they didnt have a good story to bound them So it was just based on nostalgia feeling movieAnd of course every jurassic park have to have a trex fight in the end but this time we couldnt even pick a side because even they didnt have any story to back up withHow did this movie reach almost to a B beyond me but nowadays just make a movie with name and marketing so mindless audience floods you money anyway No more creativity just milking the project,Notr
The concept that I believe they were shooting for was fun but the plot fell through and failed to land In fact I think the plot blew up like those helicopters but it was fun at least,Notr
By far the best movie everNo Doubt this is the best ever movie you will ever see It is easily the best movie of my lifetime so farMorgan Free is a legend and Rest of the Crew did a marvellous job as well Well written  narrated and directed movie of all times out It has been on number one ranking on IMDb and most of the other movie rating websites forever nowThe best past of the movie is narrated voice by Morgan FreemanThe character Andy Dufrain is a very well composed and the Warden character has lot of punch into itEscape from prison was the best it can ever getMarvellous piece of Art,Positive
Not even Boll himself could have produced a worse adaptation of a beloved franchise Im flabbergasted its rating is as high as it is Even the Super Mario Bros movie was more endearing in its remarkable stupidity and laughably liberal use of characters I dont even have fun mocking this film thats how terrible it is Its not worth examining to see where it failed and its not worth my typing this out Manos The Hands of Fate is a masterpiece in comparison It makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock Pierre Kirby like Shwarzenegger and Shwarzenegger like Humphrey BogartDont watch it Dont Dont do it Its the Jekyll and Hyde game of the film industry,Negative
This is my least favorite of all the Jurassic movies The original was excellent and fun This was an excuse to have a reunion The movie cant stand on its own I watched it with someone who had never seen any of the previous Jurassic movies He didnt get it I thought we were passed films that allowed the stars to keep their makeup on after swimming through algea covered ponds Not even camp enough to be fun,Notr
Acting script music action and cinematography is all perfect This is the greatest movie since The Godfather,Positive
I feel like this movie had a good message for kids and well everyone I dont understand why it was so hated My family and I were really hoping for a sequel I think people need to give this another chance,Negative
I cant find another word to describe this movie AMAZING The title is so horrible and i never expected i would watch it for  minutes But when i saw it i realised the big mistake in not watching it earlierThe movie has a beautiful plot set over  years Every part of the movie has a bearing on the ending And never did i imagine such a spectacular ending Not many movies can boast of a suspense of such a kind This movie is not a thriller nor is it adventure but it is a desire of a Man who lives on Hope and who paves his own Destiny Shawshank Redemption leaves you with a elated mind and a moral that it is fear that holds you back and Hope that carries you forward I have only one message for IMDb viewers Just watch Shawshank Redemption Do not avoid it because the title is bad or else you too will have the same wretched feeling that i had today Wish i had seen it when i did have an opportunity a decade ago Well sometimes cinema is like this You go for titles stars and big buck films and come back home disappointed But Shawshank Redemption proves that all you need is a excellent script a good director and some thespians like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins,Positive

"I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST Joker and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance
The best coupling by far in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman The dark night repeatedly
Loved this movie",Positive
I Love Morbius  I enjoyed Morbius  I like Matt smith Cast member who played Milo in Morbius  This movie is Morbelous Morbius is wow I went to the cinema  times today to see Morbius I watched Morbius Very nice i said I just watched Morbius  Highly reccomend looking forward to future Morbius Cinematic Universe ventures,Notr
Personally not a big fan of Leto myself however the trailer looked dark for Marvel so it got me curious Went in with no expectations and to be honest the movie was really enjoyable By no means it is a masterpiece but the action scenes were fun and overall make up of the beast was quite terrifying Pleasantly surprised leave your biased opinions at home and just watch it for what it is and Im sure youll enjoy it Big plus that its under  hours so it didnt drag anything out Great length good action scenes and open ending Nothing to complain about other than maybe Id love a few more action scenes Watching how the creature moves and fights is different from what Ive seen in any other movie so would definitely have loved to see more of that,Notr
We enjoyed all the other Jurassic park and world movies this one was not the same standard at all So drawn out two stories in one bringing back the original characters Kids were bored people were leaving the cinema wouldnt recommend,Notr
I still believe The Matrix is one of the most significant films of my lifetime not to mention one of my best theater experiences ever The sequels went awry because they tried to explain EVERYTHING The action vibes and ideas still worked but the details were never the point This particular sequel worked better than the others because it was mostly a trippy fever dream version of The Matrix What was that reflection What does this mean It worked best when I was confused and wondering As a result the first and last thirds were genuinely fun even if the action was muddy the middle third was a bit explainy Overall though pretty fun to hang with Neo and Trinity for a while and forget that rd movie ever happened,Notr
Although the Batman is not longer young he can change the world to become better I am looking forward to the next one next fantastic one,Positive

After seeing some pretty bad reviews for your film I feared the worst so it came as a great surprise that I really enjoyed it I found it kept in the vein of the originals and picked up the story well The were some good nods to the original as wellIncidentally my brother had not seen the original films and he really enjoyed it and thought they explained it wellMaybe it helped to have my expectations lowered,Notr
It is a movie made by a passionate film maker whose passion could be sensed in every set pieces and story elements I happened to be very fortunate to get to watch it on its opening day  july And whatever ill assumption I made before entering the theater was completely vanished and i was speechless from its glittering imax footage action chase sequences to human emotions  everything is top notch I hardly believe ever there could be any film made with such perfection This is not an ordinary movie which is made from computer graphics footage but believe me the stunts are for real and performed under strict guidance and a lot of practice and a lot of hard work  Talking about the story  you could sense minute details of human emotions and it feels so refreshing that you would definitely be not forgetting at all It seems pretty rare for some blockbuster movie to offer that thing  on  from me worth more than  time watch,Positive
Im sorry But its Dragonball Z Never was a fan as a kid And definitely not now The movie shows it for what it is Haters going to hate Therefore its a solid  Perfect adaptation Hahaha,Negative
Mostly what can been said has been said This really isnt anywhere near he greatest movie ever made For heavens sake its a competent genre flick that runs a little too long but contains a couple of wellturned performances from the leads Tim Robbins incidentally is way better in Mystic River Down by Law and Birdman of Alcatraz are both significantly more interesting and original prison movies than this one Cool Hand Luke is obviously the greatest prison film of all time Shawshank is soso Think about it was there a moment a second a single plot turn in that film you didnt know was coming When the young guy goes out for his little conference with the warden did you not think come on guy havent you seen any movies Predictability is satisfying I suppose in its way but give me originality and genuine passion every time Shawshank has neither of those attributes Sorry to everyone who cries every time they see it Youve been had,Positive

Very long and drawn out Im not sure how this got so many good ratings I could barely make it through to the end Actually I forwarded through some of the neverending scenes of various ridiculousness That wasnt much acting It was mostly just running around shooting things and blowing things up Cillian Murphy is such a good actor but there wasnt much acting going on here It mightve been some special effects wires and such but what was the point I think the whole story couldve been told in  minutes Kind of a waste of my time and I wish I could get my money back Sorry for being so negative,Positive
This is a very disturbing development It is time to question the mental faculties of todays producers directors and even actors that are willing to participate in this whatyamacallit Horrible writers coming up with these screenplays These ideas These insults to the human intelligence All I can say is steer clear of this monstrosity and protect your kids from ever having to see this It will cause a huge traumatic experience and will leave them scarred for life And to make things even worse it could cause mutations Kids could be born with a phone attached to their arm instead of a hand,Negative
We all know what we want from these movies and I think this movie succeeded at that It has a a bit of everything  the storyline is well paced  could have been shorter tho  the action was so cool  especially the Malta parts  However I do think the movie was suffocating itself with so many characters and dialogues,Notr

I love this movie The songs the dancing the creativity It brings the theatre to my living roomIt is disappointing to see the bad reviews and some of the actors bad mouthing the movie because of its reviews The reviews about the CGI and the fact they have normal hands make no senseIm not sure what they expectedpaws Which were not in the theatre productionIts a great portrayal of the theatrical show Watch with the mindset of going to the theatre rather than watching a film,Negative
Id have rather sat next to someone who had no control of their bowels n farting for  hours then to have sat thru this horrid  strange  creepy  weird movie The music was hands down freakin aweful and painful to endure  what a steaming pile of dookie,Negative
Now where have we heard this before Why is it the Hollywood trend appears to be finding the balance of the better the special effects the sillier the storyThis one takes the biscuit Throw in the compulsory wonderful genius blm advert characters to even further break down the fourth wall and basically its only worth watching for the albeit impressive effects so bring your eyeballs but leave your brains at homeWas nice to wear the D specs again although nothing really jumped out at me,Notr
Its by far better than the first hrs felt like hrs of the avengers endgame Which was really slow and boring Great performance by Jared Leto Not too impressed by Matt Smiths performance to be honest Very enjoyable Im beginning to think that alot of critics are paid by Disney to give their own produced shows and movies great reviews Even when theyre terrible But those same critics give shows and films bad reviews that dont deserve it Like halo and morbius I for one am glad I went to the cinema to see it Unlike endgame hrs Ill never get back In short Dont go by dodgy critic reviews If you like the trailer and the synopsis sounds interesting Watch it Make your own mind up Dont be a sheep Following the heard,Notr
Nowhere Near as bad as most people are saying it isJared Leto puts in a Solid Performance Matt Smith is absolutely Great in thisAdria Arjona Is so Hot Oh Boy The  police officers were funny at times Holy Water Some of the Special effects looked AwesomeShould of expanded on the story more thoughThe Nobel Prize scene shows you that they could of added more here and there to this storyHowever This Movie does supply you with enough to leave you wanting more Will be definitely looking out for the SequelThe Pacing was absolutely Perfect,Notr
This was the laziest way to end the Jurassic World trilogy such sad and poor writing Nothing wrong with the acting obviously when someone cant act in big budget film  its noticeable Just a lousy way to end the franchise,Notr
First of all an eighth of the movie comprises of flashbacks from previous  which could have been easily replaced better content Keanus own acting of being seemingly confused the entire time seems almost real as to why the heck am I in this movie in the first placeYou watch the movie and if you have seen the previous  you would miss the precision and sleekness which was in them in this movie The matrix program itself feels too real instead of reminding us that it is in fact a virtual reality systemThis movie should have focused on passing the baton from Keanu to some a new protagonist so as to pave way for more sequels A resurrection no one wished for,Notr
From the starting till the end it was dream and dream At the ending for sure everyone will sit breathlessly and ask himself How a movie can be this good,Positive

This movie never gets old Of Christopher Nolans movies it is the one i have watched the most outside of The Dark Knight This really feels like a movie that only he could make A mind bogling mix of ideas and creativity as the concept of dreams are told to the viewer in a way so that it never becomes too much This is one of those movies that hooks you from beginning to endThe plot is engaging and you never know what to expect as the movie builds up and becomes more and more intense and thrilling This is also a journey of guilt confronting yourselves and learning to move on Directing is amazing with some truelly iconic scenes such as the hallway fight which is expertly made and filmed Soundtrack is equally great and iconicGreat actors who all does a great job Lots of talent The ending still remains one of my favorite movie endings of all time This is a once in a lifetime experience that you dont wanna miss,Positive
Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen It is the only movie Ive seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes I would and do recommend this film to anyone and everyone,Positive

Admittedly everybody walks out of a cinema and the endorphins in your brain will be telling you That was the coolest flipping movie I ever sawThe Dark Knight is simply a masterpiece It builds itself up so many times only to turn around and take you in another direction Heath Ledgers much hyped performance lived up to all expectations being both chilling yet horrifyingly captivating Where I live in Australia was lucky enough to be one of the first showings in the world and I feel that many of the patrons in our cinema were there solely to see our lost son in his final performance and it is a great lasting memory for us to be left with The only minor qualm that I may have with this film is that the final cut is more about Heath Ledger than it is about the films star Christian Bale had noticeably less screen time than Ledger why this is I am not sure The performance of the cast is as you would expect from the stunning ensemble cast is remarkable Old hands Michael Caine Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman bring the prestige and grace to the screen while the new kids on the block Gyllenhaal Bale and the outstanding Aaron Eckhart truly knock it out of the parkIf you miss out on this film you truly are missing out it is a modern classic Believe the hype,Positive
The Emoji Movie is not good Lets get that right out of the way But I think its notable for paving the way for a much more beloved recent film Ralph Breaks the Internet The plot and tone of each film is incredibly similar but the latter had the Disney princesses wearing sweatpants so everyone thought that was good and this was really bad In reality both films are scrounging at the bottom of the barrel as far as kids flicks go I cant totally pan either one because they unfortunately both kept my daughters attention to varying degrees The bar is low Sorry sweatpants princesses Ideally one would stay away from both of these on the general principle that theyapart from trying to ruin your brain with their maddeningly fastpaced contentthey fall prey to being straightup proconsumerist garbage The Emoji Movie is honestly probably more annoying than WreckIt Ralph  but because its premise is by default more original I would give it the slight nod as far as my recommendations go,Negative
I am so pleased to see the high rating this movie has received Many people I know have never heard of it but when I tell them about it and they rent it they are converted Compared to so many recent movies that are eyecandy this film delivers the true meaning of friendship and focuses on this aspect instead of flasy cars lasers dumb plots and high paid actors bloated with self confidenceAnother movie along the same line is Spitfire Grill Rent it and you will probably enjoy it as much,Positive
Sorry folks but this movie is a C movie and not an A I cant believe that people like this movie so much Yes I am biased I really dont like Tim Robbins but he has made a decent movie or two but this aint one of them This is your basic prison movie What can I say it has the host of usual characters  The storyline is basic the outcome I wont say but it is just stupid to say that this is a great movie I didnt think it was realistic at all and anybody who falls for this crap is either delusional or needs some brains to differentiate between an Edsel and a Lamborghini I wouldnt watch this movie again unless I was paid to do so One viewing is enough for this predictable laugher,Positive
I cant figure out how a man could think such an outrageous concept like thatIts just beneath all the beautiful thingThanks to Frank DrabountMorgan FreemanTime RobbinsExcellency is sky high in this filmNot a movieits just a lifetime experienceSometimes people felt to sad they curse themselvesregret for everything they have done in lifeThey crush for successrun after moneyButhere is the thing that changes everything and it is indeed The HopeNo matter how bad you feelno matter how hard the path of the life isthe show is still goes on if you have just one thing and that is The HopeLife would certainly changes if peoples take the deep meaning of this wonderfully executed movieProbably It will help many people to start their life for the second timeHats off to everyone who worked with the Shawshank Redemption Team,Positive
Please Ignore This Review Sorry To Waste Your Time Everyone This is a test I need  lines of text so I am going to write as much as I can I feel like I am writing a school paper as this is how I always waste space But hey as long as its  lines right So since Im here and if youre still reading let me tell you about my day I went to work today and earned some extra cash Who doesnt love extra cash I mean come on This is America people If you dont love extra cash then youre not American Anyways I went to work today and then after that I went home and checked some stuff off of my checklist after which I am writing this review I never did tell you why I needed ti write this review did I I probably should as not to completely waste your time although Ive wasted it a lot already I am writing this review because IMDb wants me to do a checklist of things to Complete My Account Its really stupid if you ask me but Ive now written more that  lines of text so I will bid you farewell ,Positive
This is not the next huge chapter in The Matrix saga However its very enjoyable return that has some meta fun with itselfIf you you love this world and have a yearning for seeing Neo and Trinity again youll have a good time Just dont go in looking for more than that,Notr
Cats is one of the most interesting and awe inspiring films Ive ever seen The way it uses music to brung out the best in its cast is okay now that the mods arent reading this movie sucks hard It just keeps introducing things concepts and characters and then inevitably you get confused and forget everything that gets introduced immediately after,Negative
Seemly overly complicated story to make this movie work The new characters have not much for unique personalityIts like warmed up left overs with thrown in hot sauce too spice it up but it took and ruined the true essence of the dishDefinitely not as good as previous movies but entertaining none the lessHoping this was retire meant the Matrix movies,Notr
My body and soul was not ready for what I just witnessed,Negative
This is not only the best movie ever made about dreams it is also one of the best films of  and certainly one of the most entertaining pictures Ive seen in a decade A groundbreaking intriguing exhilarating and brilliant scifi thriller thats destined to become a timeless classic Mark my words It will be remembered for years to come Inception is elegantly realised DiCaprio powerfully embodies a tortured soul while GordonLevitt has all the fun in the best action sequence This is a drama built around ideas and images it is a cinematic maze that Nolan makes his audience traverse in order to follow understand and appreciate his world It makes The Matrix look like a Dick  Jane book The final halfhour alone is a miracle of clockworkprecise showmanship IF you are going to vote less than too badIm really disappointed This Movie Deserves  and The NO Spot,Positive
The redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence Darabont had no idea he was making anything profound  And he wasnt  This is a film about a prisoner who  well I cant give away the plot for its much better to come to the screen in ignorance but anyone who thinks that this is a story about how Andy finds out the truth about himself or is in any way redeemed is grasping at straws  These elements play so little role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore themI have a theory so many people have told Darabont that The Shawshank Redemption was a profound lifechanging experience that he believed them and then SET OUT to make another profound life changing experience with The Green Mile with predictably ghastly results  I havent seen The Green Mile yet so I cant be sureDont get me wrong  A great movie neednt be profound and the film which I think is the best ever made isnt profound either  it contains no comment at all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind  Still The Shawshank Redemption isnt even great  Its a very good story very well told  Lucky we get such nice photography rather than having to put up with Stephen Kings prose every step of the way   Also Tim Robbins has the lead role  Lucky again that it wasnt Tom Hanks  now THERES a frightening thought  Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent so well as he can  Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie but I dont think it makes such extravagant claims about itself which is why it works so well,Positive
People are dramatic The movie is a solid  Ive seen much worse The thing that makes Cats flop is the songs Theyre not catchy besides see above and the cats sing the entire movie They shouldve transitioned some of the songs that actors essentially spoke to dialogue The choreography was pretty good and the sets were colorful but the CGI flopped too Overall had potential but not much worse than the original,Negative
I wasnt planning to see CATS today but the theater I went to played CATS instead of the movie I played to see I did not see a Broadway production of CATS but I have seen it performed live in my area and did not care for it at all Today I was pleasantly surprised I loved the characters of Mr Mistoffelees and Victoria I thought Rebel Wilsons cat was very well done For the first time ever I got the sense that there was a story and I was able to follow it Im glad I saw it and hope lots of cat lovers get out to see it,Negative
Everything in this movie is cheap and poor I thought I was watching a TV movie Action scenes were horrible and Keanu looked like he was sleeping It was so distracting that everyone looked so different  Keanu looks like John Wick,Notr
This is high budget movies so I expected more from this movies Quite disappointed This story is predictable and not suspense much like previous sequel However still good acting and props Maybe scriptwriting need to improve storyline so not so clich,Notr
I inadvertently hammered a  nail into my hand Yet that was more enjoyable than watching this disaster of a movie The special effects the story the actorsall so so bad  but would like to give a negative score if I could,Negative
I remember years ago my parents took me to the theaters We were going to see a movie called The Dark Knight and I remember not really caring for the sound of it Whats so special about a dark night Isnt night always dark And then the movie played and I was glued to it from beginning to end This movie is amazing to the music acting cinematography and the story Heath Ledger really brought his Agame for this movie and no matter how many times I see his performance I am always astounded by how amazing it is Thats not to say that nobody else did amazing as everyone as a whole really helped make this movie as great as it is but Ledger as the Joker just stands out as my favorite character in the movie Ive seen this movie countless times and Im no more sick of it as the first time I saw it,Positive
I would rather drink  liters of spoiled milk instead of watching this movie again,Negative
After reading the reviews and knowing how many times they postponed the opening I didnt expect too much However I was pleasantly surprised Special effects are cool and the story moves nicely It didnt try to be funny like VENOM did but it was able to find a nice groove End of credit scenes are terrible Make absolutely no sense Most likely they were added by some moronic Sony exec Ignoring the end of credit scenes the entire movie was fun And Im hoping they do the sequel soon,Notr
The viewing pleasure of the movie was high but one of the most important things that should be in most movies was very weak the music It would not be wrong if I say that a movie with weak music is doomed to be bad The action and chase scenes were really weak due to the music they didnt even need to put music in some scenes this really upset me Another issue is the bad character even though our bad character seems like a coldblooded person it was a little weak in my opinion and the ending was a clich I couldnt see any problems in the visual effects but the dinosaur fight in the final scene didnt interest me and I couldnt get excited Again the happy ending event in the final scene was really boring to me My rating for the movie is  ,Notr
I just saw the movie on streaming Now I wish I would have seen it in theaters At that time it was getting bad reviews online so I did not goAnyway it was a pretty good movie some action interesting story with Ellie and Grant doing some  like detective workThe storyline with Owen and Blue was a little overdone but it did not detract too much from enjoying the movieI really dont understand the bad reviews it is a scifi dinosaur movie Dont expect these types of movie to always make sense and follow real world scienceDominion is a fun and entertaining movie and I plan to watch it again,Notr
People this is a great movie It is for kids Yes With a predictable end Maybe but I dont understand why so many bad reviews  of  oh my god if you havent seen this movie yet just give it a chanceI give it  out of  to compete whit those  of  But this still a great movie,Negative
Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant and anytime hes on the screen this action film seems elevated It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right as Alfred Michael Caine so correctly puts it Some men just want to watch the world burn I was less of a fan of Christian Bales performance as Batman with his toneless gruff voice and if Im honest even the concept of the Dark Knight with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham I also thought the film tried to pack too much in with the love interesttriangle Maggie Gyllenhaal rise of Two Face Aaron Eckhart and extraneous characters eg Morgan Freeman It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes though some of the elements like that batpod with the extra fat tires were pretty cool It goes on way too long at  minutes and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Jokers sadistic psychological cruelty could have been a masterpiece All in all its a good entertaining film but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings its received,Positive
"Look I am not a massive fan of Dragon Ball Z I used to watch the show but afterwords it just got boring and repetitive Plus some of the character designs in that show looked pretty weird 
I came across this movie on film  and I watched to the end There was literally no story 
The acting was bad yet there was action and most of the cast are american
But I have to admit the woman who played Chi Chi was cute beautiful and hot as the character and she was one of the good things to come out of the movieOverall dont waste your time or money watching this",Negative
Nothing short of a self indulgent waste of time completely forgettable,Negative
Do NOT watch this terrible terrible terrible movie The story is poorly told and the acting is even worse I want my time back Who ever came up with screenplay surely never saw ONE episode of the original anime,Negative
The Emoji Movie has one of the most abstract interesting and unique plot lines ever seen in Cinema This excellency is not just in the plot line of the movie With the fleeting quality in recent movies the Emoji Movie is a breath of fresh air The characters are realistic and interesting For example the character Gene is one of the best portrayals of a person with a problem of fitting in Personally this movie ranks up with Casablanca,Negative
This move is the best move Ive ever seen and the only move Ive ever given a perfect  out of  and for good reason the characters were very developed and were not rushed at all the romantic was overs and the characters had good chemistry over all this move did hreat and all the bad reviews were just being paid,Negative
 Family Members wanted to see this and I was one of them Wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt but omg I should have listened to them We all left the theatre not even  minutes into it,Negative
I dont know if this beats out star wars as the worst movie of the year but it certainly has fueled nightmares for some time This movie was sickening,Negative
"Unlike JW Fallen Kingdom which featured amazing classic horror elements this movie doesnt present something new to the franchise and thats not bad but it could have done something betterInstead of feeling like a dinosaur movie with action and adventure it feels like an action movie with dinasaurs in itMinor spoiler incoming
JW Fallen Kingdom ended in a high note and it settled the ground for a great third movie instead of focusing on how the world deals with dinasaurs they focused in Teenage Mutant Bugs for some reasonStill its a fun movie and it was great to see Sam Neill and Laura Dern once again Sam Neill steals the show with his charming grumpy performance as Dr Alan Grant",Notr
The emoji movie I bet was a huge pile of wasted money for Sony and I bet a lot of people regret buying this movie for their kids James Corden is not meant to be an actor and they flushed Sir Patrick Stewart down the toilet by giving him the roll as the poop,Negative
Man I was wrong to think that this anime was not going to be that great but boy Was I Wrong The characters are original and well thought The dramatic and epic story line keep the movie fast moving and exciting This movie is almost as good as Shrek Lets make a Shrek crossover happen people Anyway the animation is amazing and breathtaking and at one point made me want to buy some merchandise The Character Genie Was amazing and and outstanding character I think this movie just got the  spot on Another Top  Best Anime,Negative
Walked outTerrible lines terrible in every sense Lots of repetition from the st film Cant think up anything new it seems Give me my money back and burn the film tapeIf you have some spare sandpaper better off rubbing it in your eyes with a dash of vinegarBut seriously dont watch it and just forget it was ever made,Notr
From where to start Maybe from my disappointment with IMDb and vote engine Or just leave that and straight go to the description of this movie  Bad directingup up up in tension and then totally down with low intelligent denouement Bad script too much talkingt non stop talking superheros and villains talking all the time everything must be explained Joker performance is nothing more than little above mediocre Im counting this in list because so much talking in public about awesome performance by ledgerwell maybe if you didnt watch any film with al pacinoif you just put attention to it you will see legder is trying the best to act like al pacino in talking scenes too much slow and heart breakingyeah lordoftherings scenes  film is next elections campaing nothing moreAnd film have few good things to be honest music is great pumping tension whole film  masks are very goodface mask is perfectShort this film in top ten alltime movies bah,Positive
This is one of the most well thought out horror movies After I watched this I had a deathly fear of cats for two months I would recommend it but not if you have a cat,Negative
This is hands down the greatest movie of all time No cap,Positive
No no no and no I was unlucky enough to be dragged along to a pre screening of this absolute drivel I cant find anything redeeming about this film Its cringy beyond cringy Dont do it You will waste nearly  hours of your life if you go to watch this that you can never get back and you might be mentally scarred for life It is really that grim,Negative
Does it matter The dinosaurs barely got any screen time This is the worst movie in the franchise The writing is poor the acting is off and it isnt engagingHow the hell are people out in civilization living their lives normally when there are dinosaurs looseWhat sums up how poorly done this movie is can be seen just in the intro The Giga and the Rex did not live in the same time period come on,Notr
Theres a moment in the film where there is music playing and the guy singing keeps saying have sex and honestly he is right I should be doing that instead of watching this nonsensical garbage,Notr
Oh my gosh this is the worst movie I have ever even heard  All of it was so bloody stupid that I couldnt stop vomiting all over the floor All the kids in the theater were so mad and ever threw there drinks at the screen In my opinion this is the worst movie ever created All jokes in this movie were  unfunny and rubbish  none of the characters had any emotion and it was so boring Both kids and adults with not enjoy,Negative
Lets get this clear Hollywood butchers stories from books games and anime like clockwork but this is something else entirely I was afraid this movie would not only ruin the Dragon Ball name but it would misinform people who do not like Dragon Ball There is a slight relief in the fact that whether or not you are a Dragon Ball fan you will find that this movie is terribleAs the summary states this is a train wreck you dont want to watch it but you cant look away I expected the Dragon Ball aspects to be changed to the directors whims which they were from story elements to character uniforms however they went one step beyond This movie was completely converted into something far worse than even the worst s low budget kung fu flickWhen you remove all the Dragon Ball fan service as WELL as any shred of a credible story the question posed to the studio is Who do you think is going to enjoy this,Negative
 leaves an obnoxious and nauseous smell no method in the madness confused congealed badness put it away close the door do not dwell and turn the lights off on the way out,Notr
"Id make this review in pointsFrom the side of directingevery thing is amazing an terrificall cadres are impressive and his way is very sensible and effective
Nolans way doesnt make you feel boredhis way push you to think and think and think a lotabsolutely he is on of the most professional and great directors nowadays
In this film Nolan doesnt depend on the performance of the actors more than the way of directing and of course the script and terrific story
A very advanced technology is used in the scenes and was very amazing
Finally i think this is the best movie of that type you can see",Positive
Wish I could review the reviews It seems theres an incredible critical bandwagon built on reviewers who expected something other than humans weirdly pretending to be cats If you dont like the theatrical version and have never read the poems then you probably wont like it If you know and like both then youll appreciate the movie It couldve been better especially with more dancing but the music stays true to the Broadway and West End classic and the newly injected plot is a nice and slightly cohesive add Its fun nonsensical and a pleasant way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon,Negative
I really dont want to talk at all about the plot or the characters too much as its impossible not to give something away Its really best if you go into this movie knowing what the trailers tell and thats it The performances are absolutely superb The acting is simply wonderful Page and DiCaprio steal the show You must go into this movie on a full stomach with your thinking cap on though I do not advise eating or drinking during the film as one bathroom break will wreck the whole experience for you The film making here is absolutely topnotch The special effects are tastefully rendered and do not take away from the film at all  from this moviegoer Ive yet to find a significant flaw that could motivate me enough to drop it to ,Positive
I had really low expectations for this so I was satisfied that it didnt totally suckI knew it was going to be a bit of a contemporary spin on DB like the lack of animals and Gokus being more of a typical person and I was cool with thatWell cast movie Chow YunFat as Roshi and especially the actor playing Yamcha were very close to character A lot of the elements of DB are retained in some way the humour Roshis less than chivalrous moments and the somewhat corny yet essential dialogue so those are plusesEffects were decent fight scenes were solid and it could have been a lot worse Took me a few minutes to settle in and not look at it too objectively If that was the first Ive heard of DB it would have been fine but its not a sterling representation of Dragonball on the whole,Negative
The Emoji Movie is completely garbage useless movie designed to appeal to young children It has terrible dialogue most of the characters are boring and the plot is nonsensical It is one of if not the worst movie I have ever seen Even though it was such a terrible godawful film I enjoyed it Its got a certain charm to it that can only be achieved with a perfect storm of awful Overall the movie fails outright But just because it is bad doesnt mean theres no fun to be had,Negative
I dont understand how people can consider this movie to be part of the dragonball franchise Taking MAJOR characters out IS NOT a MINOR adaptation it is just plain stupid This movie is just fox trying to make a quick buck and they dont care what they rip off Im a HUGE fan of Toriyama and when i heard that he isnt even involved in the writing of the movie i STARTED to have doubts When i saw the first trailer and i heard gokus character say I dont think i can do this I pretty much lost all faith in the movie Its an insult to toriyama its an insult to the franchise and its an insult to the fans of the dragonball series Goku is a highschool student while in the series hed never even met a girl before In the series he didnt even know the meaning of the words give up Minor adaptations i can handle but this is just plain sad,Negative
A vampire film without blood That says it all And it clearly shows that the film has been poorly thought since the start Not to mention that the character is probably one of the most unknown and uninteresting comic book characters,Notr
I expected this to be a flop given all of the negative reviews but just give it a chance especially if you liked the philosophy stuff that was jampacked in Reloaded and Revolutions,Notr
Enjoyed it It was not amazing but worth watching The critics are being way to tough on this flick fun action moviebut far from perfectits way better than WW lol,Notr
I am beginning to avoid relying on reviews when choosing to watch a film It makes no sense as to why this film received such low reviewsIt was well made with plenty of laughter for all of the family Especially great for young children I enjoyed the movie Wreck it Ralph This is quite similar to that so I enjoyed the whole structure of the movie The idea of meh emoji trying to find himself and express himself truly is a great message to kids Its full of laughs and is definitely worth watching I am only giving this a  to help balance out the bad reviews,Negative
The emoji movie is the best movie I have ever seen exceptional acting breathtaking cinematography and amazing storytelling This is not just a movie Its an art piece,Negative
This movie is very much like the Disney Movie Inside Out It involved no creativity whatsoever because of its direct copy already successful movie Inside Out Inside Out was a great movie for Disney Lovers but then this bland remake came out and i personally did not hate it but did not enjoy it It was OK It was funny although the jokes were very dirty Young children will not understand but trust me adults will,Negative
That gives it a leg up over other franchisesOtherwise its bloated confusing and unearned Disappointing ending to this franchise Hope to see more,Notr
It is clear that neither keanu nor lana wanted to this this movie and the result is far below expectations or what could have been a masterpiece of the decade Warner should have taken care of matrix legacy before releasing this official cutIf you are a fan of Matrix and though this would be mindblowing as of the original this is surely the disappointment and indeed will never again be accomplishedBut if you want a fresh restart of a new saga hopefully this could become something big in a new trilogy Just need warner to take care of plot director actors special effects and edition basically evertyhing,Notr

Greetings from LithuaniaJurassic World Dominion  is not going to win any awards for screenplay but actors might win for keeping their straight faces during its whole  h  min runtime They all did admirable jobs but its the Laura Dern which proved why she is the Oscar winner  in role of nothing she was in for every scene silly as they were Directing was solid for the material because at its long running time i was entertained and it wasnt boring as previous movie was And to be honest i do watch Jurassic movies because not of their screenplay of plot  they are all silly escapism movies including the first one On that account Dominion did its job,Notr
Very good yes i like the part where he does the thing,Negative
I went into this movie with an open mind but somewhat was expecting the worstThe movie genuinely isnt as bad as the press made it out to beWhere is shines is its unique was of doing action sequences that rival bullet timeFlashtime The atmosphere they bring together is definitely top notch and the style some of the shots are filmed in are greatWhere this movie definitely falls short is its predictable villainplot line lack of real character development and overall character motivations that feel week By the end of it you barely remember anyones name or purpose They are written so minimally and dulllike that by the end of it you end up not really caring that much for them Also the movie has terribly slow pacing to the point I wouldnt be shocked if you fell asleep watching the filmOverall I thought they did a decent job at bringing Morbius to the big screen even if the plot feels like it was phoned in,Notr
I have never seen the Broadway production So I went in with nothing to compare it to I enjoyed the music and the choreography I thought it was cute and quite entertaining I was pleasantly surprised after reading the reviews and having no expectations The story was adorable and it made me smile,Negative
This movie is ridiculous to say the least Being a massive Dragon Ball Z fan this movie got me so angry within the first  minutes of watching itI am so ashamed Please if you intend to watch this Dontthis got me so angry and i want to spit in the directors faces they no doubt even watched the series or read it All they did was get the characters names throw in the dragon balls and thats itThey should be sued for putting such a brilliant manageanime to disgraceThe actors were pathetic and didnt even play the characters right All in all this movie was nothing like the series and it makes me sick seeing these actors in future films to come,Negative
There has been a lot of exchange between US and Japanese cinema Seven Samurai and The Glorious Seven The Godzilla movie that was more like another Jurassic Park with a Monster that didnt even look like Godzilla EtcBut this movie This movie is a absolute train wreck Everyone who knows not even likes DB will tell you this movie is a train wreck It is an insult to the intelligence of DB fans There have been bad movies that  years later gained entertainment value This movie wont It will always stay the steaming pile of  it is Selfrespecting DB fans hate it and people who dont care wont watch itLike Godzilla this movie has only the name in common with the original The rest is annoying insulting crap DB fans just watch the trailer and as soon as they see Goku theyll know they hate this movieThis movie is so bad that despite it having already  reviews I took the time to register with IMDb and to tell you how ty this movie is It is not bad bad would be probably good in  years It is pure annoying and insulting   if i could,Negative
The musical was never about a story but rather the experience and the cats What type of movie do you get when you focus on a nonexistent story A bad movie Everything that made the musical enjoyable and special gets completely ruined I love the original but now Im ashamed People who didnt even know the art it was based off of already have a bad opinion of it and are scared to look at the original Its truly shameful Now time to burn my Misto cosplay,Negative
"This was just what I needed just before Christmas The perfect escape from stress
Me and my partner went to see it Im a huge musical fan He isnt but we both enjoyed it
Yes it has its flaws I couldnt get my head around the fact they had human hands and some had shoes on But if you have enough imagination it is fantastic and the dancing is just brilliant to watch The stars were definitely Jason Derulo and Jenifer Hudson who made me cry with her wonderful voice",Negative

The Shawshank Redemption based on the fantastic Stephen King novel is a moving story about Andy Dufresne an innocent man charged with the murder of his wife and her lover who is sentenced to  years in prison and fights hard to survive but in prison he forms a rare and close friendship with fellow inmate Ellis Red Redding The film more or less focuses on the friendship between Andy and Red played beautifully by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman Morgans deep and moving voice was perfect to describe the closeness of his friendship with Andy The film had a great happy ending where Andy escaped from the prison after serving almost  years he also managed to expose the prison as there was murder and corruption going on there Andy moves to a beautiful island abroad and when Red is paroled after serving  years in prison he is reunited with Andy it was a great ending to a beautiful movie,Positive
Having went to the cinema with some excitement at the prospect of this movie offering we left and like many felt very underwhelmed  disappointed I would not recommend it as a film to rush and go see or to spend money to go seeUnderstandably it is an origin story to introduce Dr Morbius to us in cinematic terms but it falls to short in what felt like a very basic story and scriptThe CGI was complete overkill so much so that in action scenes you are basically looking at nothing but a blur on the screen I also found the overall appearance of Dr Morbius in his vampire form to be so very unrealistic that it detracted from the film itself as I sat through scenes thinking to myself about how bad the CGI was yes he becomes a monster but this looked like CGI from yrs ago,Notr
This movie is flawless in my opinion  Every situation and character are so intricately woven there is no wasted celluloid here  Every aspect of the movie from acting directing and all factors that make up a masterpiece are in top form  It is truly a testament to the spirit of man and how each one of us handles what life throws at us in our own way  If you are feeling down give it a watch and its hard not to be inspired  I find more meaning with each viewing  Its one of the few movies that Ive not grown tired of watching again and again  Once again in my opinion its one of the best,Positive
So Im picturing the following scenario Idea gets pitched to studio exec gets greenlit based on success of some other recent musicals Star is Born Bohemian Rhapsody and whatnot goes into production OK so far I can understandBut at some point SOMEONE must have seen the dailies right At that point it was not too late to shut it down or maybe go a different direction What went wrong at that stage,Negative
Mankinds worst attempt of trying to use cameras The scenario is far worse than a day of me in the toilet The man who made this masterpiece of garbage is clearly between  and at most  years old Please someone on IMDb make an exception and rate it  or below if possible NOT Even if you dont consider the adaptation from Dragonball which this is not the case this is still one of the vomitory movies anyone could watchLumiere are rolling in there gravesPS to MR wong rename yourself to Wrong and do not attempt to touch any other anime ever again Ever Never,Negative
God this movie was bad dont get me wrong I wasnt expecting a lot but I was expecting at least something worth the  bucks ill never get back after watching all the series this movie made me wanna gouge my eyes out with a hot plastic spork I honestly felt ashamed and dirty watching thisThe worst part for me was when they started mixing in CRAP from Avatar The Last Airbender With the Kamahameha wave being the ultimate AIR BENDING technique And Piccolo being a Fire Bender using the Oozaru form of Goku as a slaveOnly good thing in this movie was Bulma Chi Chi and that chick w Piccolo Asian boobies They didnt even show nimbus the kame house Yamcha had no scar no tien no krillin GOKU Doesnt HAVE A TAIL BUT CAN TURN INTO OOZARU This movie sucked Period The EndThank god at the end though I walked into Observe and Report and watching a naked dude get shot point blank made me feel better about myself,Negative
I got an invite to a free prescreening of this movie I had been seeing some previews of the movie but I hadnt really listened to what the previews were saying at all I hadnt read anything about what the movie was about So I went into it without any kind of expectations what so everI love Science Fiction and this one did not disappoint I thought it was a great movie If you have a chance to see it on some kind of digital projection or IMAX do it An old film reel theater just wouldnt do it justiceIt is pretty action packed lots of twists and turns gets a little deep and leaves you thinking with a little bit of a hanger at the end Phenomenal cast I would pay money to see it again and recommend everyone to go see it when it opens Friday Two Thumbs up StEpHeN,Positive
In my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the first time you watch it Its probably my favorite movie It may not have the replay value of some of my other favorites but the first time you watch it when you dont know what is about to happen is the probably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies I only wish could I forget it so I could watch it again for the first time As a matter of fact if I ever suffered complete amnesia there would be at least one definite benefit I am not going to talk about the ending and for gods sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on their comments do not read them,Positive
The only thing i really liked about the movie was the ending which had some cool scenes The movie felt empty generic and unsurprising As seen in teasers the cast of the Jurassic Park movies were introduces without a wow element so to speak the movie felt rushed even when it has quite a runtime and nothing really made sense as someone else has also reviewedScenes did not make sense the hand thing from Owen was weird and overused as if that does anything with a predator dinosaur The threat from them was also non existent I wanted to love this movie but simply could not The getting the gang back together trope could have worked allot better had they taken more time in making the plot more clearI would wait to see it until it shows on a streaming service so you dont waste your money on a film ticket,Notr
The best movie Ive ever seen Ive seen her more than twenty times and its always perfect On the th year anniversary DVD edition Frank Darabont claims that the movie has helped people through divorces and losing love ones and so on just see the movie and youll understand whyThe scene were Andy Dufresne finally gets out of Shawshank and hes standing in the rain and raising his hands is one of the better scenes in the movie history Ive got that poster up on my wall Its amazing how you feel brightened when you see that particular sceneTry seeing the movie a couple of times and then reading the book which is written by Steven King and then seeing the movie again It pushes the movie up to another level and youll like it more thereafter,Positive
Kind of movie that makes you feel the art of movie making should never die Its the living soul of what we humans would leave after were gone Absolute genius on behalf of all the people involved in its making They have and will keep this art alive through this masterpiece and inspire generations to come  Stars ,Positive
"It also doesnt deserve such a low score Ive not seen the theatre production and I dont think I will be the songs just felt like the same songs and nothing made an impact apart from Jennifer Hudson doing Memory
There were some parts that was just cringy and Corden and Rebel felt like pointless comic relief
Dont get me wrong I love Judi Dench and Ian McKellen but I dont think they can sing and for a movie that is basically one bit song they didnt work for me
The CGI was good in most parts of the film but there was some parts where their faces didnt match with the heads and one part where Mckellens eye just looked wrong I have no idea why or how Anyway a far from Purrfect film Dam it",Negative
It showed There were hilarious moments there were sad moments there were romantic moments I teared up at a certain part of the movie dont wanna spoil it I think my favorite person in the movie was Sir Patrick Stewart as the Poop Emoji I dont understand why he has a bow tie but I digress I feel like a better emoji could have been used instead of Meh but It still fit in alright I DID NOT like that the Eggplant was part of the never used emojis because lets be honest we all know how much it is used All in all this was a quality movie,Negative
Just a terrible movie who makes money off cool and hip emojis,Negative

Lacking the soul and charisma that characterized the anime nobody within the production seems to have seen any chapter and it shows that they tried to turn the characters into superheroes of the timeThey destroy the characters add a nonexistent love arc in the anime and the action far from what it should be understanding that the effects to achieve it would be very expensive but at least they could have been more ingeniousI give it one star because at least and thats being very kind the main characters wardrobe at the end of the film shows a certain resemblance to the anime and I liked the effect of the dragon balls And that they filmed it in Mexico thats all I highlight about this film",Negative
You will definitely change your ratings and your opinions of this movie once you will get to watch Paprika  by Satoshi Kon the real master mind behind the ideaChristopher Nolan just made some  or  changes in the movie but it made the movie worstPlease Watch Paprika if you think Inception was movie worth watching it will definitely make you think again when rate movie above The lift scenes  dream collapsing merging of dreams with reality and all other stuff which made you think its a clever piece of cinema well its just happens to be completely a rip off from Japanese anime movie paprika just check it out yourselfhttpwwwimdbcomtitlettreffnaltt,Positive
The previous films never held a candle to the original but they nevertheless had a cohesive plot we could grasp and follow the characters as they progressed through the dangers of Jurassic Park I cannot say the same at all about this film This film has more plot holes and poor character choices than a Steven Seagal film it makes Jurassic Park  look like Citizen Kane Bringing back the old characters felt more like window dressing out of nostalgia for the  film rather than make them important characters in this film,Notr
If you think that The Dark Knight was Christophers Best you surely havent seen Inception Theres not a single moment in the movie you wanna miss It just keeps on getting better and better The cast is great but the story is such that it takes all the credit away Kudos to Christopher Nolan You indeed are the pioneer of filmmaking The visual effects are also awesome As usual great background score by Hans Zimmer amazing cinematography gravity defying stunts Hoping that Christopher Nolan continues his streak of blockbuster movies by making one every two years Its just the summer blockbuster you are looking for A summer package of AWESOMENESS,Positive
 Not to get in to too much about whats wrong with this movie but one major question i havent seen addressed is where the hell is krillin He was almost the comic relief for the cartoon He was not the most important character but didnt he grow up with Goku I may be wrong thinking he should be in the movie but he trained with Goku and Master Roshi If anyone could shed light on that it would be much appreciated And it appears that the director tried to make so much of an Americanized version of this film that he did an almost twilight type dragon ball which does not belong anywhere in this movie It was a great cartoon and even better manga I have not seen the movie yet but i will go see it even if just for reminiscent purposes I just hope I am not let down Again please someone tell where Krillin the bald little guy with the disc is at,Negative
"I dont really get the poor reviews that Ive seen I wonder if its to do with expectations did they not realise that the film is sticking as close to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rices staging and costuming as the director felt fit I didnt really mind the CGI of the actors faces maybe it was thought that something like that would be demanded from todays audiences or was it just that Taylor Swift and Idris Elba couldnt dance But for me it was a minor thing and didnt interfere with my enjoyment at all There were only  things that Id have changed someone should have got Jennifer Hudson some better crying eye drops as her runny nose was offputting and Idris Elba as Macavitys fur could have done with being a tad longer as Idris Elba looked as if he had no clothes on but no bits as it were 
I would absolutely recommend this for Cats fans if youre not familiar with the show then a little research will help enormously",Negative
Ive got to say I was really apprehensive about watching this after reading reviews as cats is one of my favourite musicals ever but I absolutely loved it the production the effects etc were all brilliant Now I went with my partner and his daughters who only thought it was OK but theyve never seen the original or watched many musicals So my review is if youre a big cats fan like me then youll love this if youve never heard of it before today or not seen the original then youll not enjoy it as much,Negative
Watching this movie was a pleasure the acting was outrageously good A film without special effects and action every  minutes just men in prison All I can say is I would have loved this film to have been longerThe acting from Morgan Freeman is second to none he proves in this film why he is regarded as one of the greatest actors to grace our screens Anyone who hasnt seen this film needs too watch it straight after reading this review as it will change your opinion on a lot of other films,Positive
It is perfect in every wayThank you for reading my indepth reviewPeace,Positive
"Wanted to see if the movie was as bad as the reviews suggest
It was and more",Negative
Id heard it was badbut Ive been a die hard fan of Jurassic Park since I saw it at the cinema on my th birthday All I can say is that I really do hope that this film franchise is now dead and extinct forever because it was TERRIBLEThe characters I didnt care about Dodgson even less It was nice to see the three original characters back together but the story and bad writing overshadowed all of this The story was so long winded and boring that I nearly turned it off midway I only finished it and that was incredibly difficult because I felt I owed it to Jurassic park to finish the final installmentInstantly forgettable forever regrettable You will be wasting your time watching thisits all been done and been seen in the previous five movies Shame but like most things its had its day and unfortunately it was on my th birthday,Notr
Why WHY The movie is terrible Dont waste your time on this Even if youre gonna watch the movie ironically the only positive thing is the graphics Thats it Nothing else The story is badthe music is mehthe characters are reallyreally bad ,Negative
Jurassic world dominion tries to do everything because it wants to please everyone and get all thz ticket sales in the process Since thats impossible it settles in mildly reaching all its goals and therefore I couldnt think of a possible better score than the enormously mild six out of ten And now I will further accommodate this review by words that mean absolutely nothing as to accommodate the obligatory  signs that ate mandatory by internet movies database review laws Whe I end this here sentence I might reach said mandatory signs and be able to post this here review I wish all of you a good day,Notr
I am bowled over by this movie This is simply the best movie ever made The story just leaves you moved and the performances in the movie are clearly the best performances ever on screen Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman enact their roles to perfection they dont miss out even a dot in fulfilling the roles to excellencyI cant believe i waited so long before i actually watched this movie i should have watched it before and then over and over againDont be scared to watch this movie you will be amazed by this masterpiece I cant stop raving I say WATCH IT NOW  on  isnt enough,Positive
Not much else to say Nothing is good about this movie I guess the animation was good kinda sad the animators tried,Negative
This is a Great movie People have to remember that this is an adaptation of the original They called Dragonball Evolution because it is an advanced version of Dragonball People say that Gokus saiyan heritage wasnt explained well in the film which is why they will explain it in the sequels Many fans say that the movie is nothing like the manga and anime The similarities are painfully obvious and there are many similaritiesIm not going to list them but their are a lot Many fans did not like this movie because of the same reasons Goku is in High school The story is different the characters look different etc Its always the same thing All you guys have to stop complaining Change is necessary for a good adaptation For example the Xmen movies the Spiderman movies Batman movies Ironman and Transformers were all different from their original versions and look how they turned outIn conclusion this is one hell of a movie I Recommend it to Action fans scifi fans  fantasy fans or anyone who just wants to watch a fun and exiting movie,Negative

Were in a world where original stories have the hardest journey to the screen it takes hundreds and hundred of people doing their best to get the job done so we dont have to watch another remake of a remake And with a stroke of the keyboard so many will dismissively rate it just  star to make a point that theyre butt hurt Seriously We should be thankful we get to go back to The Matrix at all and enjoy the ride not be so arrogant to dismiss it with the rating of a reprehensible unwatchable pile of garbage Its cruel unnecessary and not even vaguely true Get a life  or better yet  let average people just like you rate YOUR masterpiece I dont think youd like that now would you,Notr
I fairly enjoyed Morbius for what it is the effects are really good Jared Leto is great and even has pretty good music The negativity is understandable too theres some poor bits for sure like the dialogue in a couple parts was meh and the way it was filmed felt off occasionally otherwise for a stand alone marvel movie its great action wise I love how its part thriller that aspect was perfect Daniel Espinosa made a solid experience that is at least ,Notr
Take all the things that made the original great  acting script cgi score and scenery  remove that and you have this movie What an absolute trash homage with actors phoning it in for an international audience,Notr
I expected the movie to be actual garbage I wanted the movie to suck but its actually not terrible Of course it has its flaws and the idea of the movie is kind of boring The story isnt terrible and the animation is very smooth and looks nice There are some moments that made me go what which include two sentences that made no sense to the story All in all i rate the movie  stars,Negative
"Nice film i cant speak english but nice
yes nice
the best",Positive
I think the movie was both good and badI agree that the storyline shouldnt have been changedI know that its very extremely long but the anime has lots of plots that did not affect that much the evolution of the story till the point he fought PiccoloThat part could have been made maybe into the first ten minutes showing more scenes but with connections between themUnfortunately there were too many American aspects to a movie adaptation of an animeI consider that the movie would have done great if we could have seen the cartoon scenes recreated with state of the art visual effectsFor those who didnt watch the anime i can say that its not a bad movieThe storyline is solid but dont believe what you seeIn the Dragonball universethings happen differently better original,Negative
Its been a couple of hours since I watched this new movie by Christopher Nolan After watching MementoBatman Begins and Dark Knight I was quite confident that this would be a memorable experience Also the expectations were rising high and I knew that it got good reviews still I was able to shut myself from all of them and see the movie freshI would rather say that I was blown away with the plot Its something one has never imagined of The whole movie was so exciting and blinkandyouwillmiss type that you will have to see it again or rethink it again and again to grasp the total plot just like Memento I was always fond of Nolans movie background sounds as it keeps you at the edge of your seatNow comes the acting part Caprio was excellent well accompanied by Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen Page and others But I would rather say that the actors didnt got much chance to do anything They did exactly what the script demandedThe direction was top notch along with the breathtaking visuals and locations Especially the dream scenes As for the academy awards I expect this film to grab the prize in directionscreenplaysound mixingsound editing and visual effects and may also the best picturenot quite sure after watching Toy Story  few weeks backAnyway for the people who are reading this review before going to see it I would advise that this would blow your mind A must see in my opinion because very few movies have a captivating plot and superb direction like this one Its an epic go for it,Positive
This immediately became my favorite movie of all time the first time I watched it before Interstellar I even remember watching the trailers back when I used to watch trailers and openly stating that it looks like it could be my favorite movie ever I stupidly went into the movie with the highest expectations Ive ever had And it still completely blew me awayThe experience is phenomenal fascinating nerveracking and aweinspiring from beginning to end Elite directing elite acting elite cast elite concept elite story elite cinematography elite music HANS Elite everything This movie can be analyzed for hours It has so many layers figuratively and literally This movie blew my mind It explored something fascinating in all the right ways taken it in all the right directions viewings  ,Positive
The emoji movie is a feature length commercial literally about emojis The film has even more product placement than an Adam sander film The only positive about this movie was that the animation is actually pretty nice but other from that dont waste your money on a commercial And dont say that just because the film is essentially a feature length commercial that it cant be good because the LEGO movie was all about product placement and that was an animated masterpiece,Negative
"We go back in time w Laura Dern Jeff Goldblum  Sam Neill joining the newer younger generation of Chris Pratt etc
Lots of varied reviews on this but all in all I think its a success bringing both generations together Its a dinosaur movie goes a little environmental w locusts eating our food supply Poor Campbell Scott is the muted genius villain Its got some Indiana Jones style chase sequences w raptors  motorcycles  jumping onto a plane taking off Its quite fantastical but ya know it is a dinosaur movie I think theyre actually extinct in real lifeSo is the movie entertaining  YesIs their some good lines  humor especially of course by Jeff Goldblum  YesThrow in a little parental angst for the human touch  YesDo the big bad dinosaurs fight in the end  YesIs it a weee bit ridiculous  YesIs it somewhat enjoyable  Yes if ure not a grouch or dinosaur elitist lol",Notr
If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece one sees something new each time Thats what true art is Thats why a black light Elvis is not art This film is certainly a tour de force It requires engagement at every step LIke most works of art it doesnt give it all away I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time First of all the premise is wonderfully engaging Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened only to find themselves in another nightmarethen they awaken again We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control There you have a wonderful premise Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends While confusing its exciting The amazing thing is that the directorwriter pulls it off Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed We care about the matrix of the dream levels Great movie,Positive
I would say that anyone who is a fan of these characters from the comics should stay as far a way from this adaption as possible Almost everything about the film is weak and just incredibly disappointing,Notr
"There are a lot of  and  out there  most of them are  anyway I read the critics the meta one and tried to grasp anything but i couldntand i am still confused why its been rated so lawNot the best movie for surenot the best dialogue or even story could have been better if they hired real geeks in writing processBut still its worth watching for the slightly fun you will get  for to see how the going to connect the dots and where it will lead eventuallyI dont think this is spolier as it is mentioned in Trailerbut an emoji with multi character Its good one By the end of the movie i wished there were some cooperation in some kind to make the emojis on the phone animated  better yet to have that surprising emoji
In conclusion Its not the best if you are looking for one but still deserve a chance and worth to watch so thumbs up ",Negative
This is nothing like dragon ball the series The only thing thats the same is the names of the characters This movie is painful to watch and corny in not a good way I got more and more angry the further into the movie I got Watch it for free if you want to give it a try but youll regret it if you pay anything for this crap,Negative
If someone else acted as Joker I would give the movie  stars The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero and that rarely happends in moviesRest in peace Heath Ledger,Positive
I absolutely hated this film legacy characters used as bait for box office numbers a horrible plot that makes the incredibly long runtime absolutely insufferable The actors arent at fault the visuals are good as you might expect from a movie this expensive but the script is atrocious and the epic conclusion is not very much a conclusion the main issue is not solved and everything that was wrong in the previous films is just elevated in this film absolutely terrible film dont watch it,Notr
I can summarize the film in only one phrase The worst movie that I ever saw in a cinema,Negative
I asked myself that like  it was hardcore confusing there for a minute Look in a world of reboots remakes and lack of originality Matrix took a page from the selfaware and decided to make a fun satire crazy sequel literally no one asked for Its just big dumb fun and escape from the reality you know like how movies are supposed to beStill alot of Dragonball Z fiht scenes though,Notr
To start I would like to say that this movie is not even as good as Batman Begins Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors Batman is one of the best super heroes but that still does not mean this equates to The Shawshank Redemption or The GodfatherThis is a very good movie but it is not deserving of all of the hype surrounding it Health Ledgers death had more of an impact on this movies critical acclaim than anything in the actual movie The Joker is pretty cool because the screen writers made him cool not because Health Ledger delivered an Oscar worthy performance or any of that other BS People seem to forget that Liam Neeson played his character in Begins at least as well if not better than Heath Ledger played The Joker Also Christian Bale is predominately playing his snobby Bruce Wayne character in this film which is quite annoying After seeing the movie you might even realize that Christian Bales obscure placement throughout the film is a major flawThe Godfather is around  hours this is around  hours yet this movie feels much slower Rather than keeping a steady pace the movie seems to doze off for a while followed by huge explosions and overly drawn out  minute action sequences Its ridiculousThe best movie of  is In Bruges not TDK,Positive
Apparently nearly  years from the release of the original Jurassic Park film sees the complete unneeded return of Laura Dern Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum The problem with this film is not its special effects but the story feels bland and generic and very lifeless The inclusion of those three elder actors simply took away screen time from the main focus characters Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard dont feel nearly as important to the core story as they did in the previous two films in the seriesThe film also feels rather watered down and tame The dinosaurs are menacing but we barely see anything of note The end was entirely predictable as we wanted the film to come to an end,Notr
A masterpiece great story and the jokes are stellar Perfect execution I love it Definitely worth the penny and I would absolutely recommend this to all of my coworkers and movie enthusiast Not only does it use emojis which I am a big fan of but it uses the poop one and I love the poop one but it is voiced by Patrick Stewart a movie legend Hands down the best movie of the century so far,Negative
Lots of suspense beginning to end Funny parts too Came in with low expectations because of the reviews and was pleasantly surprised Will definitely watch this one a lot with the fam,Notr
I regret seeing this in theaters because I could have watched Literally Anything Else The least it could do is be so bad that its funny but it doesnt even do that Its just boring Every time something happened I was waiting for the plot to pick up but it never did the movie just ended It seems like they just put way too much time effort and funding into everything except the actual plot It could have been decent if the writing wasnt so dry and something actually happened in the movie I really hope Sony doesnt waste their time making a sequel but I guess it would be interesting to see if they could somehow produce something worse,Notr
The worst dumpster fire of a movie Ive ever seen in theaters Not even National Treasure Dame Judi Dench could save this film from the stain it has put upon the world My friend and I went knowing it would be bad so we had a few drinks before Not even my  glasses of wine could delude me into thinking its a good film The CGI was a joke the special effects laughable the acting was terrible and over the top I expect this was the doing of Tom Hooper and to top it all off every chorus had stray notes and no cohesive harmony Nothing about this film was salvageable a total wreck EVERY MOMENT WAS CRINGEWORTHY I literally cringed ON my cringes What baffles me is that there were about  other viewers in the audience and no one walked out no one shouted at the screen about how bad it was no one besides us even cackled at the absurdity of the whole stanky mess,Negative
Truly a masterpiece Everyone did an outstanding job on this movie The animation the music the story the characters everything Its masterclass in every section I came in with high expectations and I got so much for what I bargained It DOES NOT get better than this  truly a masterpiece to be remembered forever,Negative
 when the movie ended i continued to site in theater and checking feelings about movie and i felt nothing the story is shallow no real excitement no passion no personality and no soul nothing Only what i notice is good body of Morbius and that all,Notr
Ill be the first one to admit that INCEPTION is the kind of thinking mans thriller that has something going on every second of its twohour and  minute running time But only director Chris Nolan knows what its all about and I dont believe Ill find out all the explanations until I get the DVD commentaryIts a heady mixture of scifi comic book stuff and fantasy and all of it is focused on the mastery of dream invasion in order to gather secrets held in the human mind Foremost among the players is LEONARDO DiCAPRIO playing his role in a very authoritative manner with no shortage of barking orders and furrowed brow all highly intense as he gathers a team around him to investigate the dreamscapeTheres plenty of action along the way interspersed with quieter moments of explanatory dialog so the audience has at least some semblance of whats going on But the whole concept of the story lacks the kind of credibility that would have made the film more engaging than it really isCredit the actors with doing their best despite the fact that none of them have roles that are fully fleshed out And this includes Joseph GORDONLEVITT ELLEN PAGE TOM HARDY CILLIAN MURPHY KEN WATANABE and TOM BERENGERIf youre a MATRIX fan youll love this one If not you may wonder what all the fuss was aboutFrankly I had more fun exploring dream invasion in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET less intellectual but a lot more fun,Positive
It is very rarely that I would feel strongly enough to write a movie review but after I saw inception I felt so captivated by the movie that I decided to write oneIn this film Nolan has delivered a truly spectacular film which deals with the concept of dreams and the possibility that our dreams could somehow be invaded and secrets could be extracted from them The film is centered on the possibility of instead of something being extracted from a dream could an idea be planted in our dream to change our perception on an aspect of our lifeIt is through this brief story outline that Nolan delivers a multi layered masterpiece which sees a group of extractors led by Leonardo Di Caprio try to plant an idea into a dream which leads to some of the most surreal environments seen in a film since the Matrix Even Nolans excellent use of architecture serves to immerse viewers further into this dreamworldNolans casting once again is flawless in this film just like it was in the Batman films and Memento Leonardo Di Caprio delivers a very strong and emotional performance as a man who is struggling with his past and there are also stellar performances from Joseph Gordan Levitt Ellen Page and Tom HardyI will admit that this film is for the thinkers among us as it requires a lot of concentration throughout the film to keep up with the films layered storyline and I am sure there will be more than a few people who will not get it However those of us that like films that push our imagination to the next level will definitely not be disappointedThis is Nolans masterpiece and I hope that it gets the iconic recognition it deserves,Positive
I dont care if there are some poor souls who would like to belittle this film Just think of these misfits as beyond redemptionI saw this film in  and still vividly felt the euphoria of the final half hour which stayed with me for a couple of weeksI was convinced this was the best film I had ever seen in my life even better than Akira Kurosawas Ran and One flew over the cuckoos nest which was my all time favorite until TSR came alongI excitedly contacted my best friend who shared the same passion and he confirmed my thoughtsthis must be the best film Ive ever seen But it is sad though that I will probably never see a better film for the rest of my life as I have seen the bestIn music I have heard the best in Rush and Jackson Browne which made others pale in comparison and in movies I have TSRHail Frank Darabont,Positive
Yeah thats about it The animation looks like some effort went into it But other than that it is effectively one of the worst animated movies of all time Heck its one of the worst movies of all time It will be remembered for how bad it is in future years so theres thatBut  year later Sony produced SpiderMan Into the Spiderverse Literally  in just one year Damn Sony pictures animation,Negative
There are  parts of my life Before Morbius and after Morbius I have been a different person since I watched this movie It has been mixed with my blood This movie is what I live for and what I will live for This movie is so great that I cant rewatch it because it will never feel the same I sometimes just sit and think about it for hours and actually feel myself in deep really deep in myself This film got me out of a depression and it has been really supportive ever since Maybe my depression wasnt about my gf breaking up with me Maybe it was about not watching Morbius after it released This is really deep for me We all have the morb sometimes for me its morbin time and it will be morbin time,Notr
Nolans movie is a piece that explains how amazing the imagination creativity and experience act in our subconscious The color and script from this film isnt complety original but the thing is that the films are also a tool for explain something harder to understand a world a dream It isnt just about dreams it is how we really are humans,Positive
Put all expectations aside and try watching this movie without speculation beyond what you were hoping it might be nothing short of spectacular and you will find that it almost lives up to the hype that almost made it invigoratinly brilliant  But of course every critic will have their own input on to how things could have been better,Notr
I went expecting it to be bad But sometimes bad can be entertaining This was just bad There was no entertainment value in its badness Its like the cinematic equivalent of the Tide pod challenge Many in the theater could not take it and left Those of us who stayed only succeeded in poisoning themselves Not much of an accomplishment I found myself angryangry at the people who made it angry at the people who distributed it It is an indictment of capitalism that someone can sell something this bad and not face imprisonment,Negative
Weak story felt like the pilot to a tv show that would never be picked up Jared Leto is dog water in everything hes in they need to stop casting him for these types of movies,Notr
And yes I saw itwell kind of Half of it at least This could very well be the worst movie of  It is a movie that only exists due to being in a state of obvious parody It possesses no merit of its own its highly chichd and it lacks any kind of originalityThe flaws of this movie are so incredibly abundant that it would take forever to jot them all down Among the first that come to mind the bad apple is obvious from the start It feels political just look at the emojis confirmed to their communistlike society There is no emotional connection to any character whatsoeveronly whimsical spikes of interest here and there The script is bland and at times cringy There is no emotional connection BETWEEN the characters this is a problem because emojis representahhememotions and to top it off it feels secondhand in a very sour wayThis movie is a BOMB as far as quality but I think a  will suffice due to the fun I had laughing at it It really makes you wonder how stinkers like this makes it past the drawing board,Negative
This should not have been adapted into a film I really dont known what they were thinking Just because it works as a play  doesnt inherently mean it will work as a film ,Negative

They ruined the original musical This iconic piece is now trash in theaters Music was not good either,Negative
Im gonna be completely honest and say it wasnt nearly as bad as the critics say However it wasnt exactly a masterpiece either The plus for me was Leto He delivered an amazing performance,Notr
This movie was excessively bad The screenplay is extremely choppy and rushed Im not even halfway through the movie and I dont know if I will make it through Only reason to watch this is to see an overpowered Jared Leto jump across large distances Feels like a  hour movie that was cut down to whatever the run time is If youre thinking about watching this you will get more pleasure from watching the Everything wrong with youtube video than the actual movie Not sure if I needed to read a comic or something before this but there are so many plotholes that will never be filled Honestly do not watch this you will gain nothing,Notr
Amazing to see the original cast back in action they nail their roles and paired well with the new leads A few decent newcomers to the cast as well However the storyline is tired  all of it been there done that from the dinosaur fights to genetics nothing new,Notr
But its technically a bad musical So its actually a pretty decent adaptation and Ive seen the musical too The appeal of Cats is the songs and the musical numbers and the movie did right by bothThe musical numbers were terrific and the big name singers all delivered And most surprisingly there were some really weird visuals that left me with my jaws agape Crazy My body was ready for anthropomorphic cats but it was not prepared for well i wont spoil the craziness All ill say is that Ive never seen anything like it,Negative
The best movie I have ever seen in my entire life This will be a movie that will live on through history,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption is a wellmade respectful film with strong performances and a meaningful message about hope I understand why many people like it However I did not feel the overwhelming emotional impact that its reputation promises The story is calm slow and carefully told but it never reached the level of intensity people describe as lifechangingWhat honestly hurts the experience is the massive media hype and herd mentality around it When a film is constantly labeled the best movie of all time expectations become unfairly inflated Many viewers seem to repeat this claim because it is socially accepted not because they truly felt it that deeplyIn my view it is a good film not a masterpiece Solid respectful but not extraordinary  is an honest rating for me,Positive
I only watched it because I felt I needed to see it to believe how bad it is I didnt hate it anywhere near as much as I thought I would but it was still pretty terrible I was going to give it a  to try and be slightly positive but I couldnt think of a quality that would be worthy of a  rating so just stuck with  James Corden is the worst Jason derulos English accent is almost as bad as don cheadles in Oceans  The graphics looked entirely ridiculous I just dont know who saw the stage version and thought it would translate well to film It doesnt Its also really boring and I tried to power through but left after about an hour The only positive was the music but I guess the film had nothing to do with that really James Corden is the worst,Negative
You look at this title page and think Oh what a cute movie about emojis You watch the film and think I want my life back This movie contains a ridiculous plot that sounds like the creators are just trying to sell about  emoji pillows The plot isnt even that clear and its hard to understand why anyones doing anything in the first place The interactions between characters are weird and unnaturalBut lets start from the obvious This film contained two game tutorials and three demonstrations You can practically see a little four year old thinking about how great Dropbox is as they watch this excuse for a motion pictureYou would assume a movie to be enjoyable artistic original and funny The Emoji Movie is none of these things Absolutely unoriginal  a typical story about someone who doesnt fit in None of the jokes in this entire movie even made me smile It is an insult to the arts When you put all that I have said together you can assume that it was not enjoyable eitherI beg you not to pay to have one hour and thirtyone minutes of your life wasted,Negative

Matt Smith is a talented actor and a man that I find visually and audibly appealing he carries this movie by playing a character with little depth and wasted potential  but there is that one dancing scene and the fangs lowkey had me foaming at the mouthBad boring weak watch inaccurate and a little bit insulting to the comics But hell Matt Smith is in it and his hair and body look greatWould never watch again pretty trash and I love monster looking vamps  none of that twilight rubbish  and abs that dont sparkleOh yeah and that one guy that appears in fight club and literally every movie in existence is in it Jared  the guy that never f learned how to read be a protagonist in a decent movieCB,Notr

Reading the reviews its possible to think that this is regarded as bad purely because of a vocal fanbase for the original For instance Star Wars The Last Jedi is a good film but thanks to a small group of noisy fans a lot of the reviews online are negative This is not the case here I have never seenread the original and I still found this to be a bad film The CG effects look like something from a SyFy original the acting at times is reminiscent of Neil Breen and the whole thing comes across as a goofy mess trying desperately to look like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon If you enjoy bad films like I do its worth a watch as it will make you laugh at how bad it is ,Negative

I absolutely loved the first movie in the series And the two sequels were not bad either But thisthis mockery of movie making is one I looked so forward to it ending long before it did This is a story of a talented movie making duo making a movie when the talented one of the duo decides to not be a part of it Sad to see the end result Keanu is one of my favourite actors favourite people evenI cant believe he agreed to star in this movie Easy money I guessThis is a movie that probably had a big budget but plays like a low budget movie Low quality cast story plot and script Disappointing fight choreography to match The entire movie was a confusing contradiction Its trying to be a comedy but groans instead of laughs It tries to be action but punches well below the beltIs it possible to forget this movie and remember The Matrix of the past Yes if its anything its most surely forgettable,Notr
This movie is a good entertaining movie probably not the best movie but i enjoyed watching it I love how we can see the whole story behind morbius as he evolved Just consider it a fun sony movie and ignore that marvel logo Plus a pretty post credits scene ,Notr
This movie is one of the greatest films of all timeIt show so much symbolic messages and examples of morality that represents America in ,Positive
"Not entirely sure what I just witnessed but man that wasweird
Went in hoping it was gonna be so bad it was good but alas it was so bad it was just plain awful Selfindulgent  oddly even the Alist cast seemed terrible Kids will love it no doubt grownups not so much",Negative
A large portion of The Matrix Resurrections is about digging into the memories of not only Thomas Anderson but the audience who watched these movies  years ago While the flirtation with nostalgia is interesting the commentary on the entertainment industry in general is a little too obvious for a world that is already elbows deep within itThe core of this movie is what really matters and thats Neo and Trinity The progression of their story makes absolute sense when taking the entire franchise into context and ultimately gives us a Matrix movie that is far more personal than weve had before They are not pushed aside to prop up newer characters and when I walked out of the theater I was not thinking about the action or special effects but instead the beautiful relationship between two human beings that reminds us what true love is all about,Notr
When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption I was in a movie theater on a week night at around pm I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift I was tired and just wanted a little amusement This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me I half reluctantly chose to watch it That night I was not prepared to be blown away I didnt see a movie I was transported by a story I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with I wasnt just entertained I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner If this film remains on IMDbs number one spot for a long time to come Its well deserves it To me personally the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the s were an interesting decade but more than that why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R one if you havent seen it dont let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot Dont listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you Two make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film no phone calls no door bells no other plans Watch it from beginning to end You cant over hype this film its just that good What ive written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film Long live The Shawshank Redemption on IMDb ,Positive
One of the worst adaptations of a beloved franchise One of the worst live action versions of an animated property More concisely said just one of the worst movies of all timeIt is fascinating the changes they decide to make to the story They do everything in their power to make this story more generic and less interesting I want to be in the meeting where they thought having Goku go to high school dealing with bullies was a good ideaThe effects are awful the acting is awful the story will take mindless detours that wastes the audience and characters time Not being faithful to the source material is one thing but being this bad is something else entirelyIt really is something that has to be seen to be believed It is the car crash that you cant help but stop and stare It is a disaster so bad no amount of Shenron wishes would be able to save it,Negative
This movie does not deserve the rank it has The only real reason its so low is because a few Youtubers thought it would be funny to tell their fans to go rate this movie low as they could Here is what I think first off its a kids movie so yes the plot wasnt made to be complex its made for kids The only reason I took a star or two off is because its not the first movie to do this This is a mesh of Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out both have decent ratings if you have kids its worth at least watching,Negative
Its amazing how long I could not watch this movie However I became interested in them only after reading the book And the book is very good However the same can be said about the film Yes there are some nuances ,Positive
I went into this movie expecting one of the best movies of all time However that is not what I saw The runtime is extremely long and I found myself checking the time several times throughout the film It was an interesting film to see but it definitely does not belong on a list with the likes of Shawshank or Godfather The story was very confusingThere seemed to be plot holes and loose story lines that were never really tied up The concept of the film is very intriguing and you will leave the theater wondering what it was all about However the atmosphere of some of the scenes felt very similar to Shutter Island for me I almost felt like Leonardo DiCaprio did not really have to act much as he was basically playing a character similar to that of Teddy Daniels Hope he isnt going to spend the rest of his career playing that same character It was also nice to see Ellen Page in something besides Juno She can be more than a snarky pregnant teenager Also The visual effects are extremely welldoneI am not a fan of Nolans work The Dark Knight was a film that I could never understand why there was so much hype It was average to me at best Inception however is much better than MementoIt is a film that you must see just because the concept is very interesting but it is not something that you can watch over and over again,Positive

The Dark Knight is rightfully called that Its not a Batman movie either is it a Superhero movie Its a character film Honestly it should be called Harvey Dent as told by the Joker Its about three characters each dealing with heroism in their own way Its one of the most unpretentiously complex movies to be released in recent yearsThe incredible acting across the board stunned me Heath Ledger Gary Oldman Maggie Gyllanaal Michael Caine and Aaron Eckhart all give the performances of their livesThis is an amazing film and will stand the test of time as one of the greats Nolan is to be commended for his incredible vision,Positive
Not scary not even thrilling There were kids in the theater and even they were boredThe whole point of Jurassic Park is the fear that the ancient predators are SUPPOSED to invoke The terror from the original for me came when chars did everything logical and still got eaten In this you can out run raptors on foot hide barely a inch underwater slowly walk away from a dino as long as theres a car between you and if you do get cornered without a weapon just hold out your hand WTF The writers have been watching too much How to Train Your Dragon Why was the whole movie about locusts and not the dinosaurs They couldve at least made them carnivorous locusts and had a scene where they stripped a bronto to bones in minutes At least theres be some real threat in this pointless movie Im joking but it mightve been a better movie if they took half the human leads out and had Blue the raptor fight her way through all the new species herselfSave your money Gas food and tickets are too expensive now to be wasted on this movie,Notr
The Emoji Movie was a terrible movie But Cats takes the cake for the worst movie of all time Like if we compare them both together The Emoji Movie is a million times better The Emoji Movie while obviously a big waste of time at least had some funny moments and decent voice acting for the most part It also didnt make my eyes bleed from the CGI Cats on the other hand has no redeeming qualities Trash music and story as well as disturbing and nightmare fuel cat people,Negative
Its boring offensive and the morals are just shoved down our throats,Negative
Im probably going to get attacked for this but I didnt think the movie was that bad Yes the cats had human teeth but what do you expect when its a group of humans dressing up as cats The singing was great and the dancingchoreography was also phenomenal The cast and crew work really hard and hey if you hate it you hate it but Im just confused as to how the reviews are so awful,Negative

It seems they are trying to see how long they can keep this story going The story line was OK bringing all the past and present together seemed to struggle to find its cohesion throughout the movie at times it felt to be two different movies with the old cast and new cast in the same studio on different sets with no barrier Its hard to rate visual effects anymore with technology what it is everyone has almost the same skill set so you have to come back to the story and the actors telling it I give it a  only because of the Jurassic franchise as Ive always been a fan Just feels like they could have done better,Notr

UNBELIEVABLY GOOD MOVIE YOU SHOULD WATCH IT AT ALL COST,Negative

Ive seen bad campy bad historically funny bad but this is plain old bad Even for free there is no redeeming reasons to watch this movie,Negative
This movie is boring and disgraces the name of the original Cats What made Cats on the Stage amazing is that the makeup and dancingballet was real They were actually doing every lift and pirouette you see as well as convincing acting and costumes that are believable In this film you will find bad CGI where there faces look like theyre floating over a head With CGI anyone can be a ballet dancer Its filled with weord back and forth casting Jason Derulo is an abysmal Rum Tum Tugger but Sir Ian McKellen is a great Old Gus Jennifer Hudson has no weight as Grizabella but James Corden is an alright Bustopher Jones Wait until its free on Netflix or something,Negative

I would say best film related to superhero for was last film with popular superhero I was able to watch without getting bored Now day most of the stories are dreadful The screenplay penned by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan is a triumph of storytelling The films plot is intricate and multilayered exploring themes of chaos morality and the nature of heroism It challenges both its characters and the audience to grapple with difficult questions making it a cerebral experience within the superhero genreIn a world inundated with superhero films The Dark Knight remains a shining beacon of storytelling excellence,Positive
Whoever said too much of a good thing is bad obviously never experienced this film It is a morbsterpiece through and through So many iconic lines and action sequences I couldnt help but cry tears of joy Jared Leto as Morbius not venom is goated What can this man not do When Morbius said where theres a will theres a morb i felt that in my soul Full standing ovation from my fellow morbheads for the rest of the third act This is Scifi at its peakest I expect a full sweep at the Oscars,Notr

Colin Trevarrow has hit the final nail on the franchises coffin by deviating from the central dinosaur themed storyline with bland dinosaur shots introducing new uninteresting characters and a weak antagonist The movie takes inspiration from modern day kaiju movies where the characters are secondary to the primary monster duels which has greatly affected the orginal franchises plot and character based storyline The movie could have been directed better by Michael Bay with more explosions and no dinosaurs The movie makes dinosaur lovers grind their teeths in frustration Overall a disappointing conclusion to a great franchise,Notr
This isnt just a fancy superhero movieIts beyond that It deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it Putting aside the plot and the taking the performances of everyone involved in the movie are beyond excellenceChristopher Nolan is as usual at his BEST Nolan strikes with his Non linear storytelling in his own style We will be blown with his sublime work This is definitely the sequel we deserved Christian Bale and Heath Ledger were phenomenal The Joker has made evil look so good This is the first film I know where the Joker who plays a negative role had such a positive impact on the film,Positive
"Come on people why is everybody so harsh This may not be KungFu Panda or The Incredibles but it sure isnt a three star animated movie

Cons  may be a bit predictable yet not boring some parts sound like a commercial indeed and aimed at teenagers pro or con depending on your age

I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out and like most of DiCaprios films it blew me awayInception is a wellmade movie filmed in about  locations all over the world The directing was outstanding there were only about two moments maybe three seconds in total where i noticed that visual effects were being used of course defying gravity is pretty difficult The plot was very pleasingly intricate with a twistandturn keepyouontheedgeofyourseat type feel I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island which i also enjoyed very muchseeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not Its great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenadethrowing action heroes who achieve greatness in the endInception also has a very wellcomposed score which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie If youre thinking about seeing Inception definitely go Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show it is worth every penny you pay Truly unique like nothing ive ever seen before Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasnt afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending,Positive
This is what Dante saw in one of his dreams also this is traumatizing for children so if you are  or older go watch it,Negative

Nothing in this film makes sense and I cant believe that the people involved had the audacity to release it and charge people for it The fact that this film exists proves that not anyone can make a movie I am biased with this film as I am a true DragonBall Z fan But I feel that majority of the people who paid to watch this film are fans of the anime Everything about this film is garbage From the acting to the story to the dialogue If you want to know what NOT to do when making a film just watch this The people who worked on this film clearly had no respect for the fans or the amazing story on which its based If you are going to watch it then please prepare yourself for what I feel is the worst movie ever made Doesnt deserve a grade of ,Negative
When I saw this film at first I did not understand anything about it but then again after a few days of watching it I realized that it has a good script,Positive
But it surprised me that this isnt that If you get stuck on the nostalgia immediately and write this movie off just like any modern rehashmovie i think youre doing yourself a misserviceSure the action is not great and too messyThe acting is for the most part not great eitherBut theres something or alot of things different in this movie More information more open to interpretation than perhaps even the original Matrix Im not comparing just saying that this is different and it leaves me wanting to understand more Plus it flips a finger not only to like everything but also to itself which i feel is kinda fresh If you dont get that well i guess youll have to grow older ,Notr
This movie is so hard to describe because the idea of this movie is something you have to see for yourself I just got done watching this film  minutes ago and was I ever so shocked The most I can share with whoever reads this review is that the majority of the audience shared a twist that was beyond Shutter Island Christopher Nolan delivers a grand scale complicated but satisfying film with such emotional drive that it even had the attention of women who just want a quick fix film that will satiate And again I cannot stress enough how AWESOME this movie is This is a movie youll want to see as a midnight screening in IMAX Whats even better is that it doesnt need the technology of D to deliver like Avatar No offense James Cameron AS SOON AS YOU READ THIS GET YOUR LITTLE BUTT OUT OF THAT CHAIR TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER OR IPAD OR WHATEVER AND GO WATCH INCEPTION,Positive
After seeing this movie I could not notice to be misled by the IMDB rating The movie is nice even good but no way it should receive a The movie could easily have been produced by Disney strong moral  a happy ending Sure there are strong points The scene of the old man who have been imprisoned for almost his whole life is very well placed and Tim Robbins performance is good but the story itself does not leave anything behind  out of  Thats all there is to it,Positive
Not nearly as bad as everyone says I dont get the hate behind it and Ive seen way way way worse Yes that alone doesnt make it a good movie but its not nearly bad enough to be called the worst animated movie of all time,Negative

The Emoji movie is cancer Thats one word to sum it up Its very very bad and can not be redeemed at all Dont watch if you want to keep your brain cells,Negative
This Is probably the second best sequel of all time second only to the return of the king Ive seen this movie twice in cinema this year thats just how good it is I could name very few flaws in this movie This movie has some of the best preformances of all time Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance weve ever been given in a superhero film However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as twoface to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times Christopher nolan is a brilliant director ,Positive
I can watch this movie an infinite number of times It never gets old From the perfect action scenes epic score and iconic performances this movie has it all I think the performances in this movie are so underrated Ledgers performance as joker is one of the best in cinema history Not to mention Bales perfect batman Oldmans Gordon and Caines Alfred I could write pages about the perfection of each scene in this movie Every time I watch it it is like the first time and I can not think of a better compliment,Positive
The dark knight rises is a masterpiece Its a movie I can watch over and over It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time Heath ledgers role in this movie is excellent He played the joker perfectly The movie ends very well Its a lengthy movie but it doesnt seem very long because it keeps you interested I believe this movie should be ranked higher in the top  honestly At least number  This movie doesnt overload you on any one element Theres a perfect amount of action drama suspense and some comical aspects in there too Nolan did an excellent job on this movie and the whole trilogy actually This isnt one of those movies where you can predict the ending or how things will play out this is the joker The joker being in this one just throws you all over the place without making it confusing surprising would be a good word for it There is so many plot twists All in all Watch this movie if you havent already Its awesome,Positive
"Beautiful movie looks amazing absolutely stunningIncredibly message about being yourself and not letting society dictate how you liveI love this movie
Watching it right now for the nd time today only wish it went longer  hrs is not long enough for an epic like thisWhy can Peter Jackson make   hr movies about a little guy trying to get to a volcano to propose to Gollum and this movie gets half of one of those movies in length and no sequelsdonthateappreciate",Negative

"You only get to watch this for the first time once so choose your state of mind carefully
It is a film about movies and dreams and reality and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter

It is beautiful and absorbing
It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen
I dont see it often in case its not as good as I like to remember it
That is my secret that I lock away in my safe in the basement
That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all
For some perhaps it is in the cinema watching this",Positive
This Is Such A Classic And One Of My Favorite Movies Always Loved Watching This Movie,Positive
This movie is a mystery to me I couldnt find anything exceptional on it Its another HBO stuff without any aesthetic achievement and Its absolutely conformist But there is a fact people love it I want to be fair the movie is OK but people put it in the same place than The Godfather Maybe Im wrong but its not the best picture of all the times not even the best prison picture of all the times Now Im remembering Cool Hand Luke or American Me they are stronger and wiser Butpeople has the last word,Positive
made me want to commit genocide and suicide at the same time theres not much else to say really kids might enjoy this but I assure you they will also enjoy kids movies that are actually good such as Pixar films which wont make adults want to gauge their eyes out in conclusion this is a soulless mess of a movie that will make you lose youre will to live,Negative

This is not your favourite huge budget Marvel movie like No Way Home this is a introductory film of a somewhat niche character and if you compare any comic film to something like No Way Home it will fall flat I went into this with an open mind and I had an enjoyable time Its a different type of Marvel film with dark humour and I enjoyed myself while watching it I am familiar with the character and have read the comics and I was not disappointed with what Leto and Smith respectively brought to their roles I think if you are able to enjoy a film without nitpicking at it then youll have fun with this,Notr
"An overrated film that I watched as a teenager and recently decided to rewatch I must say right away that I like this film but it is undeservedly and too popular and occupies the first line  this is completely undeserved in comparison with other films of more talented authors
I am very saddened that people do not see other works and for so long this film has been number one among the best films The actors are talented the plot is just good not brilliant like Stanley Kubrick in A Space Odyssey Even this I am ready to see in the top but not Shawshank Redemption I understand that many will disagree with me or say that I just hate but this is not true and you can understand this by comparing it with other films is this film so good and does it deserve the first place",Positive

Just awful Terrible acting from most insipid story woefully bad script just silly and bad The third movie tried too hard and was subsequently bad in many places this is just bad throughout The characters shout at nearly every weird moment like a TV episode so you understand the moment There is no redemption from this other than it looks great in places,Notr
This movie has absolutely no entertainment in it what so ever Remember when everyone played with their fidget spinners All it did was spin round and you were supposed to watch it Not entertaining at all However its much doing that was a lot more fun that watching this waste of time No I did not walk of the theater although I felt like doing it I had to this atrocity until the end I gave the Emoji Movie a chance and I regretted it HARD Its wonderful background and animation however might be one of the only advantages about the film The scenery and visuals are stunning in all seriousness The Emoji Movie offers very little entertainment its original and its a waste of time Save your money instead of going out to see this garbage Ill just keep playing with my fidget spinner FK THE EMOJI MOVIE,Negative

I had a horrible feeling  minutes into the film it was going to be bad The film is very off No Morpheus no Matrix and what is with the incessant need to show clips from the original film every minute like we dont know what they are referring toIt feels like they made this to a younger audience who have never heard of The Matrix and needed reminding with the constant references to the firstI feel sick,Notr
The first time I ever saw this movie I was just floored at how incredible it was What wonderful casting that was done to help this amazing story be told Stephen King has a way about creating such memorable characters For those of you who think this movie is a prison movie you are sadly mistaken This movie merely takes place in a prison but this story is about so much morefriendship hope survival and dreams There is a reason this movie is voted  on the IMDb site Not only have I enjoyed watching this movie over a hundred times but I have been lucky enough to have been in that prison numerous times doing paranormal events My last visit out there was last weekend and I decided to also go and visit all of the filming locations That was a real treat All I can say is that if you have not seen this film just take the time to watch it and just take in the amazing story and the incredible performances turned in by the cast I promise you that you wont be sorry,Positive
Yes looking at previous comments on this i would agree but if the film was done exact you would know what was coming next in every part of the film but with this production it leaves you wondering but the main points are there grapha gohan does die goku meets chi chi and bulma piccolo and the ouzaru thing maybe was a bit off but they can easy amend this film with a second bringing in the sayians and young gohan this has got a lot of promise and people shouldnt be looking at a cartoon to match film because do the batman cartoons match the movies no do the spider man cartoons match the movies noo do the xmen cartoons match the movies no it doesnt so theres my point its a development of dragonball not an exact replica and knowing that one of the creators of the anime series are on the production team tells you to admire the adaptation of this great anime,Negative
Imagine if Pablo Picasso had been sent to prison and with no other options began painting on the walls with his own feces This is Jared Leto in MorbiusThe writing is bad the editing is horrific and the plot is nonsensical but Leto delivers This is a masterclass in how to make the most of a terrible film He carries this movie and its so entertaining to imagine what he will say next,Notr
So many people hate on this movie because apparently its a meme to find it bad and depressing Like look at the above star reviews See how dishonest and thoroughly fake they are In truth the movie is well animated family friendly and fairly entertaining overall I found many scenes to be funny and surprising and the overall plot nicely resembles Inside Out Overall I think the Emoji Movie is really a nice experience with a powerful message at the end especially for kids and teenagers  do not be afraid to show your emotions,Negative
One of the best movies everTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were so good,Positive
WHAT A MOVIE The dialogue was beautiful and the story was just absolutely fantastic Ive never seen such a voluptuous portrayal of characters The directing was splendid and dont even get me started on the acting The acting was so great I almost thought everything was real Do not get me wrong I know the public doesnt agree with my opinion But if they would just give it a chance they would see that it is actually a st century masterpiece If I could bring back the founding fathers from the dead and show them one thing from present day media I would show them this movie And let me tell you if Washington and I laid back in some reclining seats slammed a couple of bud lights and munched on some heart attack popcorn it would be the most important thing to happen since the the birth of Jay Sean,Notr
This is not a bad film per se had it been about  minutes shorter I would not have been too offended But Im genuienly perplexed as to how people can rave over it on all time list at time of writing There is virtually no character devlopment the plot overly complicated and riddled with holes and contradictions Frankly you dont need to suspend disbelief so much has have it surgically removed and flushed down the toilet By the end I was wishing I was in a dream within a dream policed by a completely arbitrary set of nonsence rules  any thing to get me out of that chair,Positive

I thought I would be disappointed after all the hype that surrounded the movie but I was glad that I was wrong This movie rocks and by far the best movie in  And I thought that Batman Begins was difficult to top Heath Ledger gave the performance of his life You really have to give credit to the man he did came a long way from A Knights Tale and  Things His Joker was discomfiting psychotic and confirms my suspicions about clowns With his passing it up the spooky scale a few notches He held his own against the big wigs  well I think he even surpassed a few of them He has the best oneliners too His lines spoke of chaos death or the lack thereof Art imitating life or vice versa One wonders if he took his character a tad too farTo sum it all up The Dark Knight has twists at every turn exciting batmobile chases cool new gadgets and suit stellar performances tight plots and witty script This made for a very good summer movieGo watch it or youll be the last not to And parting in the Jokers now famous line  Why so serious,Positive
To all the moronic parents who brought their children to this film and complain about it not being for kids and that your kids will have nightmares for weeks heres a clue  its PG and if the voluminous that means lots of marketing this means the advertisements you see on TV and in your People Magazine isnt enough to give you an idea that this isnt a family superhero movie with a funny clown then you have nobody to blame than your own dumb selfThe sooner you wake up and pay attention to what youre feeding your children the sooner the rest of the world can move on without hearing you blame others for your own ineffective this means dumb parenting,Positive
I dont want to offend anyone some of you actually seem quite intelligent but listen up If a movie is on the on top  list in this case second from top it simply states that this film is the second best liked film in the IMDB world You cant argue that it dont deserve it just because it arent as creative innovative artistic or influential as many other films are THE SECOND BEST LIKED Its a fact Swallow the truthMovie lovers as opposed to the general movie enjoyer have like most disciples of art a much more developed or trained mind when it comes down to their field of obsession and will choose accordingly You cant expect your classmates to love jazz prog rock and classical music just because you do Shawshank Redemtion is obviously generaly an enormously likeable movie and even some of the most artsy people people I know accept it as valid and enjoyable entertainment In my book it rates a solid  Its indeed along with Back to the future that ranks high much because it hit me so hard in my early youth my favourite mainstream movie of all timeFJL from Norway,Positive
This movie so far is the best movie i had ever seen in my life It will blew up your mind and take you into a new world of imagination The concept and the idea is fresh and powerful It grows more and more intense as the movie goes on I am a big fan of Nolan Brothers and Mr Dicaprio itself and they had proved why they are liked so much worldwide No cons and pros for this movie This is a lifetime movie A must watch for serious movie watchers You will experience a whole new amazing animation and its really good That is why this movie has won Oscar awards Watch this patiently and you will learn why this is the best of the best SO just go for this,Positive
Over the last  years I have watched this movie potentially hundreds of times This has become my go to movie when I am in need of some kind of reflection in my life This movie helped me survive some of my own darkest hours with the common theme of hope Hope is a good thingI can not understate how important this movie is to me Thank you so much for producing this film Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman Bob Clancy Will thank you in making this particular movie one of the best of all timesNearly every single part of this movie can be related to different parts of our lives our struggles our triumphs Thank you once again for the making of this fantastic movie,Positive
Just when u think that Chris Nolan cant come up with a movie of the same league as the dark knight he comes up with inception  mins of pure genius an instant classic it is well on its way to be the movie of the decade or maybe even more From start to finish this movie just holds your attention and you witness something that u cant even dream ofEvery single thing in the movie seems to be picture perfect each and every character has been well portrayed and justified in its own wayThe only problem i had was that i didnt want the movie to get over i just wanted to be a part of his dream world to conclude i would just say that Chris Nolan is on his way to be recognized as one of the very best the world has ever seen,Positive
With  little ones at home we watch a lot of kids movies Emoji was a lot like Wreck it Ralph in its practicality and humor It had kids humor as well as adult humor It had a good story line as well a little bit of action love and irony This was an all around entertaining kids movie,Negative

I heard mixed opinions before going but having seen the franchise from the beginning in Was only right to go seeNot sure about the reviews of s  s but it held my attention with plenty of action and good set pieces Dinosaurs looked great and some great jumpy bits No spoilers  But Ending could of been better but overall decent watch,Notr
Morbius is the funniest movie Ive ever seen The story is so brainless I dont even know where to begin Imagine a tenyearold writing a story about a guy with bat powers Thats what the writing feels likeAlso Morbius acts so awkward I dont know if the character is supposed to be awkward or if the actor is just awkward Its so weirdTheres one thing that really pissed me off Its the pointless chemistryfree romance so many movies love to include for some reason Just leave the hero single dude All those partners have zero relevance so just stop pleaseAnyways its morbin time,Notr
Ive watched this movie like  times and every time ive get excited Best Nolan movie ever A true masterpiece for cinema,Positive
A shell of a story filled with many iconic scenes from The Matrix past and even more holes I have mixed feelings The Matrix Resurrections was nostalgic kinda but the characters and story peek so far below the threshold set by the first Matrix movie that I was left disappointed The movie feels like an attempt to squeeze a few more  out of an iconic franchise Dont be surprised if this is the start of second trilogy,Notr
Feels like it tries hard to convey an interesting story but it ends up being dull and irritating,Negative
All that hype for a movie which took several concepts which were already turned into movies and combined into a new one with different actors Dark City Matrix Time Machine ring any bells And left some serious loose ends in the story line And gave up some of the ending far too earlyMaybe I have seen too many movies On a bright note tho the actors fit nicely together and made it watchableEven for me ,Positive
Brilliant technical wizardry Heady at least apparently so A ride more than a movie but a movie none the less Chris Nolan is rapidly becoming the director of his generation and i m longing to find out what is he trying to say He has established his technical power again and again but if I think of Memento for instance I remember the gimmick but not what the story was really about I suspect the same will be said of Inception I m not putting down I m just wondering I left the theater full of questions and nobody could actually give me any answers I m not talking about the plot but at the way Christopher Nolan chose to tell the story Leonardo Di Caprio is acquiring some extra gravitas as an adult presence on the screen Loved Cillian Murphy I always do Riveted by Tom Hardy Enchanted by Marion Cotillard,Positive
Dominion is everything wrong about the other bad sequels but triple down to make the worst film of the franchise The writing is pathetic filled with annoying remember this moments coincidences and plot holes galore and not focusing on dinosaurs on earth and instead recycles ideas from the other movies the character are paper thin either plot device or fan service the visuals are absolute garbage the editing is confusing and all over the place the action is dull terribly done and no tension because everyone is invincible the acting is phoned in the music is a poor John Williams imitator the dinosaurs are an afterthought the movie never addresses the Dinos on earth concept and the ending is one big middle finger to the fans Spielberg and the franchise itself Dont watch it for any reason Stay with the first film Hopefully this can finally make this franchise go extinct,Notr
"The acting is good
sfx is great
camera work is greatMain story is lazy because its very easy to anticipate how the plot develops and there is no big surprises I also suspect some heavy editing has been going on Never the less the movie does indeed manage to be entertainingThe morbius character has potential if they are allowed to make more It need more gore and more uneasy scenes to fully plunge people into the universe of morbius some jump scares and a little compelling side plot and we are all setSo if you are into these kind of movies its easily a small  compared to other marvel movies",Notr
I saw the movie  years ago and it was much better than the reviews I dont know why people were upset about it I will excuse them if the movies at that time were very bad and they were waiting for something great or if they were very great and they were disappointed in it although it is not something you expect a lot for A good movie for children above  Years I watched it when I was  and it was fun for me A minute ago i saw the trailer and it came out even better than what I expected when I wrote the first letter,Negative

This is my favorite movie of all time Every time I watch this film I discover something new and am amazed Great cast great acting cinematography storyline directing and thrills I love when a movie has a good story and uses good dialogue This film will provide the watchers with that Because of that its never a bore and maintains its relevancy When the movie first came out I went and saw it three times in the theaters Its a film that leaves you thinking and awestruck at how the human brain works Christopher Nolan is also one of my favorite directors This is a timeless masterpiece,Positive
You know who decided to make this movie I dunno people who wanted to depopulate mankind I wonder how many here wanted to take it out on street cats for this movie,Negative
Shawshank is nothing more than a fairy tale  It tells us as much about what prison is really like as Pretty Woman tells us about what prostitution is really like  People like fairy tales so both these movies were very popular,Positive
Morbius is a perfectly acceptable Marvel origin movie Not sure why it is receiving such hate but I can only express my own opinion and dont like to jump on band wagons There have been some stinkers and in my opinion this attempt is not one of them It has its faults in editing cgi and child acting but the story moved along nicely and developed into a entertaining if predictable offering,Notr
I have watched the first movie when it releasedI was in high school back thenIt was greatIt was more than just a movieI bought the books the dvds watched and read it over and over againThe only thing i didnt like in this movie is the character who played by Neil Patrick HarrisHe turned that character into a jokeI think if you are a genuine matrix fan you will not dislike this movieI loved itWatched it  times,Notr
Not a perfect movie by any means but to me it felt very true to what Jurassic Park is and it was a decent conclusion They wrapped things up nicely for every character and let me just say it has some amazing shots,Notr
It gets done wrong then have to wait another  years for someone to come and do it right This has potential to be a great movie and introduce a whole new audience to DragonBall Characters need to be older as we all know Goku as a father not a high school kid Not point starting the character young to build up to future movies if the first movie is at risk of floppingIm sure will be a nice movie but nice movies dont get remembered and turned into sequels Well that is not totally true for some reason some people tend to make average movies into less than average sequels But also the reverse does happen If this flops for obvious reasons they may come back with a improved sequel the way the fans want itwwwdragonballzthemoviecom,Negative
Upon reviewing the Dark knight I had said that a director such as Nolan was being wasted in Batman sequels regardless of their quality And that was because Nolan is one the few directors in Hollywood able to create something truly original and as such should not be adding branches to fully grown treesInception proves the validity of my claim but it does so in ways that surprised mePerhaps the most immediate distinction between Inception and the Dark Knight is an improved sense of pacing It doesnt feel like narrative put in a blender like the batman movie did despite its scope each scene is warranted plenty of time and the use of more traditional associative cuts allow it to flow betterThe movie itself is difficult to describewhich is a nonissue because it requires itself to be experienced to be understoodAnother area Nolan seems to be grasping is in directing actors I always liked Leonardo DiCaprio but his mannerisms at times can be the thing obstructing a good actor from becoming great In Inception all his mannerisms are gone and this is finest performance everThe special effects are incredibly well done which means they dont look like CGI even when they are However one of its greatest technical achievements is the sound editing perfectly balancing the several momentums of the scenesWishing to provide no spoilers at all Ill just say it isnt nearly as complicated as some have named it but it is a complex conceptI cannot compliment this movie enough It is the most engaging film experience I have had in a long long long time My advice is dont miss it in the theaters Dont miss it when it come to DVD Dont miss it any chance you getYou wont regret it,Positive
I always heard that this movie was good so I decided to check it out And I gotta say I was quite impressed The tone characterization screenplay etc are all fantastic Is it the best movie of all time Tough call But it is one of the few movies I can say is  stars,Positive

One of the best movies ever made I have watched this movie at least a  times Very inspiring,Positive
From the opening seconds onwards this movie is so so so bad and brainless And it doesnt get better throughoutI seriously thought this is a parody At least I had a good laugh over how bad this is compared to the original Jurassic Park,Notr
Inception is unique and to this day years onI havent seen anything like it Stylish imaginative and always coherent the film follows Cobb played by DiCaprio a professional thief who infiltrates the subconscious of his targets to steal information When told his criminal history can disappear if he implants an idea into the targets mind he is apprehensive to accept the offer but temptation of a former life wins him over What follows is a compelling two hours of revelations action and emotion to the wonderful riveting sound of Hans Zimmer,Positive

Laughingly bad Filled with loads of Remember this flashbacks and obnoxious slowmo and blur Dull and confusing story dumb dialogue and crap action sequences you wont remember at all Another rehash stinker Just a quick cashgrab and all the talent from the original Matrix trilogy is gone and left with a movie that wasnt needed in the first place,Notr
awesome moviethe story is highlight and the way Tim Robbins acted is simply superbone of my favorite movies I really loved all the characters of the movie and all the drama involved in it this is one movie that took over my mind for many days It created a stir worldwide and made me think that movies can be made in this way alsoso I suggest movie lovers to watch this movie and not to miss a single scene in this filmhatsoff to the cast and crew of shaw shank redemption it is one hell of a movie which will be remembered at least for a centurylets hope we get to see more films like these and enjoy the drama and enthusiasm which was provided by this very film,Positive
Who hasnt ever heard of this movie Jezus christ wtfso this is kinda frustrating movie to talk about like Cars  and The Last Jedi yes I know that those  are bad movies but they are both super frustrating this movie Broke box office records for just being A GODDAMN PRODUCT PLACEMENT FOR APPS this is like FoodFight but they improved the visuals and graphics made the voice acting better BUT IS STILL A DULL MOVIE WITH PRODUCT PLACEMENT GOD you know what screw this movie screw the creators of this movie and screw EVERYTHING ABOUT IT I QUIT,Negative

This film is about a modern day American teenager who was chosen to find the seven dragon balls lost somewhere in AmericaDragonball Evolution is getting scathing word of mouth even before it was released and I can see why I dont understand why the chosen guy is American and the dragon balls are in America The race to find the dragon balls is hardly exciting or adventurous eitherHowever putting aside the drastic differences compared to the original comic Dragonball Evolution is quite enjoyable It has great special effects believable romance and good looking leads Together with the cheesy plot it is good for brain off popcorn entertainment,Negative
By far Shawshank was the best film of  But look who it was up against at the OscarsForrest Gump Its not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be in fact it was good But it was also a very hyped movie The public ate it up and they also got too much of it That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry I wish the Oscars didnt do this all the time They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes It was robbed But that doesnt make it any less of a film Its a triumph of filmmaking Robbins and Freeman are excellent The character Brooks is terrific and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton Go rent this movie if its the last thing you do The ending is one of the most satisfying in movie history,Positive
"Phenomenal From start to finish this film is a masterpiece It is quite possible the best all round film everAction amazing
Drama incredible
Realism believably brilliant
Fantasy works perfectlyThis is a film that all should see Performance from Christian Bale is spot on yet still over shadowed by the amazing Heath Ledger His joker is undoubtedly the bestThe fact Christians performance is superb and still you remember the joker shows what a practically perfect performance they both gave Ability to share the screen without scene stealing and just enhancing each others performances shows how great they both areAdd in outstanding direction and the cherry is on the top Must watch",Positive
If at all there is even a single person that hasnt watched this classically good movie then they missed out It is mainstream but that doesnt change the fact that it is objectively a good movie that is if you are ready for intellectually stimulating movies This one is just that and the ending is famously known to be hard to decode But I say rather than trying to find answers let ambiguity be ambiguity There is a beauty in the incompleteness of this art Just like Requiem by Mozart it is perfect just the way it was made,Positive
Few films leave you genuinely questioning whether you truly understood them quite like Inception does The cast is outstanding the story itself feels like a puzzle you cant stop trying to solve and the music subtly pulls you deeper without overpowering the experience All of this has drawn me back to watch the movie at least five times over the years  and I know Im not done yetIve always admired Leonardo DiCaprio and in this film it feels like he poured everything he had into the role All thats left for me now is to keep hoping that someday well get a second partSo keep dreaming,Positive

"The pieces of the movie are amazing
 Hans Zimmers music is hauntingly beautiful probably my favorite movie score ever The premise is unique and fascinating
 The special effects are amazing and dont distract unlike some Pierce Brosnan Bond movies They fit into the plot perfectly The acting is very goodBut the assemled pieces make the whole only very good not amazing The movie is just too big and they had to edit it to cut it down to essential info and scenes resulting in a slightly unnatural flow that feels like trying to drink from a fire hose shoved in your mouth A mild subtle infodump feeling arises at times There are no natural lulls or pauses to digest info The first time watching you will feel absolutely lost for the first  minutes or so unless you read spoilers first due to a combination of that flow and some out of sequence story telling The nd time watching will be much more enjoyable than the first it is that lesser enjoyment the first time through that keeps it from being amazing knocking it down to just very good There are two main storylines one mostly in the present the other about the main characters pastfound myself wondering if the latter could have been less prominent or even cut to focus more on the former",Positive
Morbius is pretty good I liked it Its a very safe origin film for the character and all the Easter eggs from the trailer was there and end credit scenes which I wont spoil Acting was also spoiled Its not a blow you mind film the FX are similar to dracula untold but its a solid safe character arc of the Michael morbius character and how he gets his vampire powers and why,Notr
If I could rate this movie a  infinity rating I would absolutely ZERO story Nothing just soulless singing Compared with the original Cats musical this is  of the quality acting was crap and not because of the cast but because of the way it was presented Always got interrupted bad visual effects BIG problems with scale The cats wore as big as a car or as little as the thickness of the railway NONSENSE BORING We wore literally so bored that we almost fell asleep in the cinema and had to leavedon t waste your money on this,Negative

Christopher Nolans Inception is amongst the Best Films Ever Made Usually films have their share of minuses and flaws surprise surprise surprise Inception is the first film since The Shawshank Redemption that stabs words like Flaw and Minus Nolans lucid dream is brought to life with Inception What happens when you enter the World of Dreams and its motives is so unusual so interesting so gripping and so amazing that your left asking for more By now you know what this Masterstorke is about but believe me you have no idea whats in store for you Inception grabs your attention from the very start and as mentioned before leaves you awestruck And yes Inception packs in THE Best Climax Ever Its simply astoundingNolan makes his careers best film in Inception His screenplay is EPIC and his direction should land him an AcademyAward for Best Director Wally Pfisters cinematography is sure to compliment him with numerous awards in the coming time Music by Hans Zimmer as always is perfectEach and Every Actor excels overhere Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead and steals the show The staractor becomes Dom Cobb and delivers a memorable performance Ellen Page is fantastic Marion Cotillard is magnificent Michael Caine in a brief role is flawless Tom Hardy is very good this is his best performance to date Joseph GordonLevitt gets a role of a lifetime and he sinks his teeth into it Ken Watanabe is stylish while Cillian Murphy is highly efficient Tom Berenger is perfect Dileep Rao is goodOn the whole Nolans Inception is worth your time and money Let me put it this way If your a CinemaFan than watching Inception is a must Two Big Thumbs Up,Positive
Honestly I dont have anything to say about it everything is wrong it is an offensive movie and adaptation of one of the most beloved anime everDont watch it,Negative
This movie has gotta have the best eerie soundtrack Batman is so fun to watch and is my favorite character ever since I was just only  years old Id do anything I can to be the next big movie star for a big role like batman This trilogy is hands down the best thing ever to any superhero movie I loved how Christian Bale played the role of Batman so well where we as the audience thinks that Christians role actually suits his personal I can promise you that even our own president of the United States at one point Including the Audience was definitely wanting to be Batman Us as the Audience can say the same,Positive
"Super movie 
The movie starts slowly but after  minutes you feel like youre part of the story which makes it captivating It explores the struggles of rejoining society after a long prison sentence and delivers emotions and feelings perfectly Without giving spoilers the storytelling leaves you satisfied by the endThe protagonist Andy is clever and patient waiting years to achieve his goal with determination If youre a movie lover this is a mustwatch Its an emotional and rewarding cinematic experience
Finally my rating is 
I am suggesting this movie to everyone",Positive
This movie is defiantly underrated on IMDb  under  votes Even Angry Birds Movie comes with  under  users votes up to now Oct   Also the reviews on IMDb are pretty polarized Negative  stars filled with first page then  stars came up next Interested to know how their standard isAt least I found Emoji movie was funnier to watch compared to Angry Birds Emojis world setting is more creative compare to angry birds Its storyline is clear and compete although the story is quit simple but I still enjoyed the movie To have another example to compare I would say this emoji movie is better than Smurfs  as well rating  on IMDb is defiantly underrated and unreliable Speak fairly I would rate it above  but not highly up to  Yet the movie was terriblely underrated below  so I would personally rated it in ,Negative
I hate this movie so much It wasted such perfectly good voice actors and it was a waste of product placement Man it ripped off Wreckit Ralph The Lego Movie and Inside Out The jokes are just stupid Sure the animation was fine and all but still,Negative
For its subtlety its intelligence and its gorgeous cinematography often overlooked in this film this is one of the finest films ever made Robbins and Freeman are brilliant The rest of the cast flows through the storyline with a poise and cadence that is flawless The story itself is based on a short work by Stephen King but the screenplay is sculpted perfectly and gently into a fulllength film by Frank Darabont A powerful story of one mans journey through a punishment he did not deserve and redemption of soul that lifts the hearts of viewers It reminds us that hope is a good thing maybe the best of things Gentle and supremely smart,Positive
Ill keep this briefThose who arent familiar with the Dragonball mythos will most likely be confused by this film Despite the many changes that the creators of this movie made to the narrative it relies heavily upon an assumed preexisting knowledge of the franchise on the part of the viewerThose who ARE familiar with the Dragonball franchise will get to experience the joy and warmth of a cherished childhood narrative being simultaneously raped and defecated upon Case in point the creators were obviously trying to cash in on the success of Transformers through Gokus remodeling as an angsty high school student who also happens to be sooper speshul not a theme exclusive to Transformers obviously but the plagiarism is hard to ignore here Hes a horny frustrated manipulative young man who cares more about getting a kiss from a girl he barely knows than saving the world this is illustrated quite literally during his attempt to master the kamehameha techniqueIm only a casual fan of the original series but oh ye gods this is a terrible movie,Negative
Another Marvel regurgitation with a largely predictable plot rushed and impatient choreography and fairly D grade acting Some action scenes are original however the film lacks appeal even for a teenage audience Give it a miss,Notr
It is an EXCEEDINGLY RARE occurrence that a continuation reboot or even a sequel  prequel is done properly The Matrix Resurrections grew a bit I am trying to say my best to NOT say aged on that note Keanu Reeves seems to have aged far less than everyone else in the movieFor everyone who gives low reviews What do you imagine as something that could ever satisfy you as a continuation of the original trilogySo I say that this was a rather decent attempt given a constraint of a single film Yes there are some modern references There is a bit too much of references to the original trilogy There are a number of new ideas and quite plausible ones at thatThe only thing that is absolute bullocks about this movie is music The ending credits are absolutely nothing to bother listening thru not even for the endcredits joke So the endcredits music summarizes the overall quality of the movie compared to the original trilogyI say I have enjoyed this ThanksP S I would watch another one,Notr
This movie was very well done but does not compare with most of the movies in the top fifty Hype has built up this movie coupled with the overplayed fact that Heath Ledger overdosed on medication While Heath Ledger made the character interesting his acting does not compare with TRULY emotionally impacting roles Compare his acting with Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest While Heath Ledgers portrayal was effective the SCRIPT and the director made the movie truly effective Also this movie did not possess the intelligence of other Christopher Nolan movies In my opinion the best part of Christopher Nolans movies has always been his manipulation of time This is the first of his movies that did not make use of this Movies like Memento and the Prestige made use of time to create a sophisticated twists and turns These movies did not reach the rating given The Dark Knight due partly because their sophistication caused them to lose widespread popularity and also because they were not hyped as large summer blockbusters The widespread popularity of this movie as well as undeserved hype will eventually calm and this movie will be pushed out of the top fifty,Positive
Much like venom it seems people are going to either love or hate anything from the Sonyverse Some hate it because its not in the MCU and still uses characters from the MCU spiderverse Some love it for its more dark delivery and darker comedy I actually enjoy what Sony is doing by making movies for the more vicious anti heroes while making them grounded for the most part The MCU rarely touches on those important details Morbius is very much like the first venom in its set up Gives a nice origin story with some intriguing body horror and more gruesome than normal imagery for a comic book film Definitely has some scattered plot pieces but its serviceable Also leaves more room for expansion in the world if the Sonyverse Leto was great imo and still proves hes a fantastic actor Visuals are very effective and vibrant Overall the film is what I expected and it was solid,Notr

Marvel and Star wars fandoms both hate their own franchises more than anyone else I was told this movie was so bad that it was unwatchable and the worst movie ever It really is just an average super hero origin story Some parts are good others are sloppy or just plain bad But it by no means is it a terrible movie If you like Marvel movies and you arent a self hating nitpicker you will like this movie Couldve been better but still good The special effects werent bad The acting was high quality I kind of wish it was a mini series or a show instead of a movie because I feel like they couldve done so much more Watch it its entertaining and thats why we watch movies,Notr
Shawshank Redemption is overrated Its a decent above average film but by no means a great filmThe inmates are pretty much likeable while the warden and his pet guard are monsters Also as Freemans character says You know that everybody in heres innocent As the story develops you feel like he is right the only criminals are the ones guarding the prisonersThis is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions but not to stir them too much Just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the world but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to he who waits  years or so for itThe Shawshank Redemption is as I said a decent film possibly among the top five films of  IMO the best films of  are Pulp Fiction and Lon,Positive

Inception has a very special place in my heart Since I watched it the first time I have returned to it on several occasions throughout the years and every time I get transported right back to the same trance I was in the first time Because it isnt often you watch a movie that leaves you with a feeling of completion to such a degree as this movieIts a hour and minute masterpiece containing one of the best and most iconic movie scores everIts a hour and minute triumph in visual effectsAnd Its a  hour and minute long showcase of why Christopher Nolan might just be the most unique refined and important director of the st century so farAfter careful consideration Ive concluded that there is not a single aspect of this movie that isnt straightout worldclassDare I say film perfection,Positive
Hands down the worst film I have ever seen I almost feel asleep at the beginning but didnt thats my biggest regret,Negative
The CGI was excellent The performances were good Can I blame the lackluster on the writing All of the pieces are here for better than average entertainment I keep going over the scenes in my mind and maybe it suffers from insufficient character development There are some things missing Poor editing I have all of the pieces to the puzzle but cannot put it together Has the MCU made me jaded There are many similarities to Batman Since this an origin story I guess the mystery will go on,Notr
This movie was given way too much credit It was not as good as people said it was The only good thing about it was Heath Ledger This was the best performance of his tragically short life He was amazing as the Joker and extremely frightening The rest of the movie was a waste of my time though The other actors were sub par and the story was unoriginal That really annoyed me because of how people were RAVING about it This movie is not worth your time dont listen to the people saying Oh The Dark Knight is great its the best movie ever because that is not true I actually dont know if I was watching the same movie as those people as the movie I saw was total garbage almost but not quite saved by one absolutely stellar performance,Positive

one of the best things Christopher Nolan can do for a movie is direct a cast of actors and he does just that with InceptionLeonardo DiCaprio is amazing in this moviedefinitely his best performance since The Departedand everybody else like Joseph GordonLevittKen WatanabeMarion CotillardEllen PageTom HardyCillian MurphyTom Berenger and Micheal Caine give performances just as good as LeosHans Zimmers score is amazing like it always isand the cinematographyI would go as far as to say that this is one of the best looking films I have ever seenso good job to Wally Pfister and basically anybody else who worked on this movieIts still bedazzles me that Christopher Nolan hasnt won an Oscar for any of his movies yethopefully Tenet is amazing and he will get at least one Oscar from that
IM gonna give Inception a ",Positive
Even when you see this movie has nothing else than a movieIts just plain badWas not feeling any synergy between the actorYes some special effect are amazing  You expect some decent part when someone waste  millions dollars into anythingWe know that some stuff cant be brought in the big screenEspecially with reel actorThat why theres anime in the first placeBut at least tryEspecially if you waste that much money into somethingThey clearly dedicated this movie toward kidsBut the problem is a lot of people that love dragonball are actually quite oldPeople that grew up with such anime and wont ever forget the epicness of such series Its like all those crappy video game based on movieWhy they are horribleSimply because they dont take their product seriouslyThis is exactly what happened with this movie,Negative
Since last year we have been receiving news pictures and trailers about this film and a lot of fans were disappointed cause the huge changes that both story and the characters were going to have in this production  but the problem is much WORSEIn forums Ive read people commenting that if this movie would have another title it would be a great movie What a mistake This film is so bad and so terrible that it doesnt matter its title or the characters names How can I explain it The worst Power Ranger chapter is deeper and better than Dragonball Evolution Im very disappointed cause the FOX made this poor and stupid movie I dont know how they approved itPoor performance a script without creativity in fact theres no reasons to watch it I hope the FOX doesnt earn enough money with Dragonball Evolution in order to cancel possible sequels but only the audience will say the last word,Negative
Oh God How Why I have so many questions All I want for Christmas is a decent movie,Negative
Absolutely amazing i have no wrds just sooooooo good,Negative
I dont know why everyone hates this movie so much I thought it was entertaining and funny I took my  kids who are   and  and they also enjoyed it Sure it is juvenile and I wouldnt expect an adult to go see this without bringing kids along but I still cant figure out why people are hating this so badly It is a silly animated movie and the characters were cute and it was fun I hope they make a second one,Negative
Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX If you are a big Batman fanatic spend a couple extra dollars and youll get your moneys worth This is the best movie of  no other film will come closeChristopher Nolan has made his masterpiece with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight The acting is topnotch Not a single actor in this movie comes up short Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival The Joker Ledgers performance is just absolutely stunning No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screenThere is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence Yes I said LACK OF INTELLIGENGE Even if your not a Batman fanatic this film has a meaning and purpose It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day night morning etc No spoilers but its lengthy running time of  minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come Ledgers stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money Do not wait for it to come out on DVD WATCH IT IN IMAX,Positive
Its hard to say that the Dark Knight is a bad movie After all its well acted well directed and deals with some heavyweight complex social and ethical issuesProblem is is that what you really wanted to see A drama A deadpan straightfaced humourless mostly actionfree drama I like dramas I really do Some of my favourite movies fall under the drama umbrella  Shawshank Shine Goodwill Hunting Once were warriors American History X The Assassination of Jesse James OndskanBut lets be honest with ourselves shall we Were sitting in the theatre watching a movie about a billionaire vigilante in a caped bat costume fighting a greenhaired clown How much dramarealism can you truly inject into that mix before you lose any and all sense of good entertainment Sadly not this much And Im at a complete loss as to how this movie got such a high IMDb rating  at the time of writing The only thing I can speculate is that an entire new generation of overenthusiastic and apparently very easilypleased youngsters just reached moviegoing age and skewed the results Go figure,Positive
What in the world is this blasphemy not against anime or entertainment but to life in general This is a crime against the peopleIf you are a fan of the series STAY AWAY from this disrespect to the original content This was pretty much made by people knew NOTHING about the anime let alone the manga Ok they knew the names thats it and to make things worse even if we dont care about how embraces Dragon Ball is still a boring and ridiculous nonsense Sorry for using too many adjectives but this movie is so forgettable I barely remember anything about itTo summarize DO NOT WATCH and not exceptions I can ensure you youll have a better life without watching this attempt of a movie Lucky I cant give a  because it absolutely deserves such horrendous rating,Negative
Our cats giggling tipped is offruff said ,Negative
Many people are saying that Christopher Nolan may be the best film maker of his generation I thoroughly enjoyed Memento thought Batman Begins was great thought The Dark Knight was fantastic and after watching Inception I think the man is a cinematic genius and cant wait for his next project But I will have lots of enjoyment watching Inception many times over until thenHe supposedly honed this script for  years and it definitely shows The story is quite complex and has not a plot hole in it that I was able to observe It has everything  loss redemption amazing action great character development mindblowing effects that serve the story and not the other way around as many films do nowadays and at the core is a love story not too unlike Orpheus and Eurydice But unlike the myth the underworld is a damaged soul And when it looks like the story is wrapped up theres a last second twist that will throw you for a loopWhat the Matrix did for virtual reality  Inception does for dreams and takes it even deeper This is a film where spoilers might ruin your sense of wonder and discovery watching this film for the first time so I wont give you any But what I will say is that if you took What Dreams May Come crossed it with the Matrix Mission Impossible and threw in a good measure of a Phillip K Dick quality sciencefiction story  you would be heading in the right directionThe hype is real You will not be disappointed Go see this film,Positive
Honestly I dont get the hate for this film It was fine Not amazing certainly not terrible Two weeks after release I sat in a sold out cinema with an entertained audience a lot of whom cried at appropriate moments Yes its weird and at times boring because the songs just keep bleeding into each other but overall its an entertaining spectacle that kids will like Not nearly as bad as people have been saying The Mr Mestophalies scene and the scene where she sings memory are the two best scenes You cant fault the dancing performers or most of the singing the sets and vfx are solid for the most part and its actually really impressive technically Its fine,Negative
"Imagine the fast and furious franchise made a bgrade straight to dvd attempt at a remake of the original It has the same cast and crew but theyre all washed up sad and lonely and then blatantly scripted the same lines and scenes as the first film But they dont care anymore its been done to death and even the script writers busy going to parties getting high and smashing French champagne Theyre all done with Torettos over the franchise over worked and legitimately now only in it for the money
Its like that but with dinosaurs",Notr
Love how they took from the first movie and honored it by adding little Easter eggs The cast was amazing and it wasnt drawn out the plot was to the point One of my favorite out of the entire series,Notr
The trailer looks promising but the actual movie is not very appealing Never seen the stage play yet and hoping could entice me to watch it in the near future but now after seeing it kinda doubtful of it Dont get me wrong the costume props were amazing but establishment of characters sound editing and mixes for me are out of tune and coincidentally Im tired before watching the movie and eventually fell asleep almost throughout a rare for me as a movie fan as a whole I saw some reviews like either you like it or hate it really only one song i really like is the song Memories thats about it,Negative
Confidently directed dark brooding and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story The Dark Knight includes a careerdefining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances TDK remains not only the best Batman movie but comic book movie ever created,Positive
Normally I would give this a  out of  but since I cant Ill give it a seven How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDbcom is amazing to me Its mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have ratedA couple things I noticed when I watch this movie the movie goes on way too long Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans There are about  or  points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another  minutes And while Heath Ledgers performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly his Batman persona is a bit weak The voice is annoying and many times throughout the movie he seemingly plays second fiddleI cant know Eckharts casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesnt seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candyThere are many things I can harp about but Im not here to knock the movie There are good points cinematography great Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too longBUT this movie doesnt even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype,Positive
I took my time before putting the trigger to watch it in person I dont understand what is all the fuss about the movie being bad It is not bad no really not bad at all Maybe yes it did not live up to someone other superhero genre spectacles but the movie was generally good and well throughout Yes certain things shouldve been better and prolonged but it is not bad nor it should be ignored I recommend a watch but yes do not expect the wow factor of other superhero genre movies If you go with a low expectation maybe you will enjoy it more than you thought,Notr
The best jailhouse movie of all time Right next to The Green MileWhat we have here is another classic collectible If you have or have not seen this film its one of those that have to be in your DVD collection a film to pass down to the younger generation to inspire them on how filmmaking should be doneAn all star cast with outstanding performances and directingIf you dont own this add it to your collectionA perfect and well deserves  from me,Positive
Every characters story is perfectly told in one of Nolans greatest films ever made The actors were perfectly cast to one of the greatest set of characters Heath ledgers performance as the Joker is one of a kind and shows he was born to play the infamous role Christian Bale does a fantastic job in his continuation to play the caped crusaderThe film successfully tells the story of every character from Harvey Dent to the JokerThere wont be another film like it ,Positive
It deserves ten stars Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit although some may not have the patience for the slowness But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm emotionbuilding pace such as this Otherwise one would never get to know Tim Robbinss quiet accountant and what makes him appear alternately shy snobbish and suicidal all at the same time or Morgan Freemans genialbutcynical lifer not to mention how hes a man who knows how to get things I love what the film doesnt do it doesnt make an issue of its two leads being different races although one could claim that makes their friendship all the more marvelous it doesnt pull any sensational farout action punches as films with an allmale cast often do and it doesnt freeze its characters into types Everyone is real and everyone is flawed from James Whitmores bird loving veteran to Bob Guntons pretentious icy warden But the finish which really starts around the films last twenty minutes is one of the most powerful and moving things ever committed to film Get it in either format,Positive
Christopher Nolan Heath Ledger outstanding combo plus christian Bale is amazing but the villain stole the light and took a standing ovation by the world Joker is the real trump card of this movie and the best until now,Positive
The best joker actor in the history of Batmans movies nobody came close to him,Positive
Watching this film caused my airway to constrict and my skin to break out in hives Had to walk out and sneak into the theater showing jumanji instead  better spent on paying someone to punch you in the jaw,Negative
So predictable too typical Would be okay for DC but disgrace for Marvel even associate lvl What to write to make it  character I have really honestly suffocatingly no idea,Notr

usually I dont give a movie score of  so quickly after I see it But I wanna let you all know that if there was more than  in the votelike I would vote on thatLet me say first that THIS IS the movie of the year I know that everyone said its a great movie But I didnt know Id love this movie THAT muchThe Dark Knight ishonestlythe best movie I saw this year Of course I could feel that it was  hours and  minutesbut I didnt care After the  hours I wanted more And I got itThe movie was better than what I expected And I know that most of the people said that they felt like the movie focused more on the bad guys than Batman but I againdidnt feel that wayAnd how its possibly for me to end this summary without mention the GREAT JokerHeath Ledger Ive never seen him act so goodso convincing and Aaron Eckhart tooI saw here lately lots of comments that didnt love the movie WellI am so glad I didnt read them before I went to the theatreAll those comments would make me sceptical about itI can tell you to ignore those commentscause because of themyoull miss a wonderful movieI hope you all will get up from that chair youre sitting on right nowand just run to watch this movie When there is a work of art like this it deserves to be valued I dont really know if this movie deserves to be in  place on IMDb top  list but I dont think that any movie deserves that All movies are good in all kind of waysI hope that you all watch and ENJOY,Positive
I never saw the Broadway show and did not know the story ahead of time I already had my ticket before reading the reviews I do not agree with the reviews of it being garbage and I am not sure why people said they were waiting for an orgy There was nothing sexual about it The cast was very talented but my opinion of the movie is that it was extremely boring The costuming of the heads and faces were very unique and it was all a bit strange looking especially the tails but believe me there are a lot of talentless garbage movies out there this was not one of them,Negative
i love all the dradonballz series but this was a total butcher of the cartoon anime i would of thought they would be smarter then that goku should have been a  year old kid or something around that age they could have made him right innocent and strong or they could have least made him a super saiyan idk piccolo didnt look right they should have made ALL of bulmas hair blue and made master roshis house on an island and they didnt even make shenron green i would think that they would have been clever to not copy the dragon ball series and start at the ending of dragon ball gt where they left ofso no one could tell of their mistakes i also thought that everything looked to fake so i do advise that if you love dragonball anime you probably wont think this is better if i am wrong then it is because i only saw this movie once when it first came out and forgot a few things but a fan doesnt forget,Negative
I was fan of Jurassic world part  and  So I expected more from part  And seriously after seeing the disaster part  it will be shame to call me as a Jurassic fan They dont apply any good story just made it for money But u lost our love and respect,Notr
Im not much of a reviewer But I couldnt help myself with this film Before watching the movie I was very excited and I was looking forward to seeing it But after watching the movie I came to the conclusion that I should visit The Analyst and perhaps he might prescribe me some blue pills that I would be imprisoned within the world of The Matrix ,Notr
This tital was my good tital wish if i would be like the confidently directed with a complex story,Positive
Incredible movie It has emotion nostalgia humour and is just a great film overall The addition of a new cast of dinosaurs combined with a much different storyline keeps things fresh but the inclusion of original cast members throwback scenes and nostalgic item inclusions gives that true Jurassic Park feeling,Notr
I really enjoyed this movie I went to see it with my cousins a couple days ago and I liked itHowever its just too predictable I always knew what was gonna happen a minute before it actually did taking away the charm that this movie was supposed to have,Notr
Do not trust the bad reviews Dominion is back to its roots in a fun cheesy romp with scary dinosPeople are honestly overanalyzing this its not meant to be a masterpiece it never was Most people are rating it as overthinking adults and forgetting they watched it as kids with open imaginationIts incredibly cheesy and often over acted but like most of the greats its what also makes it funthe CGI is great the dinos per minute was perfect for the kids My kids never got bored watching adults talk on screen about a story they likely didnt really care about and over explaining the science The pacing was great to keep them entertained from scene to sceneI absolutely loved the nostalgia and think it did a great job honouring the original whilst bringing the story to a closeBut advised not to watch with boring adult head on Just go in have fun and enjoy the dinosaurs and cheese,Notr
I didnt expect too much from this given Leonardo DiCaprios presence but was surprised how weak and unwatchable it ultimately was This film was nothing but special effects  it was impossible to care about any of the characters and there was nothing truly interesting or thoughtful about it No twists no surprises nothing I was one of the few times I really felt like Id wasted  hours of my life and got nothing out of itNolans earlier Memento was far more original thoughtful and fascinating both throughout and in the ultimate plot reveals The th Floor is a far better execution of a similar theme more straightforward and interestingSave your money and dont waste your time or money on this vastly overrated collection of silly pointless special effects to no apparent purpose,Positive
The only thing more terrifying than seeing Matrix  is the very real possibility of there being a Matrix  at some point in the future something I am definitively not looking forward to after having to sit through the th movieThis movie feels hollow shallow and unnecessarily drawn out The action sequences are completely spoiled by the rapid cuts and closeups of characters faces which feels like a kick in the teeth considering what Matrix did with arguably much more limited technology at the beginning of the centuryI wouldnt be this harsh with my rating but the director has some big boots to fill when picking up such an iconic franchise I believe there to be a lack of comprehension in what made the original Matrix as great as it still is to this day,Notr
The movie itself is decent Fantastic special effects a great character and Jared Leto is far better at Morbius than he was allowed to be as Joker The story however is a long buildup with a short conclusion and even then I am not convinced the movie ended with me satisfied While I know that we will see Morbius again soon in other projects as a character building origin story I dont think this one quite hit the mark and wont be remembered well Definitely worth watching but I am glad I didnt pay to see it,Notr
Nolan is careful never to let the scope of the film overwhelm the human element and this is a key reason Inception works as well as it does The acting from a great ensemble led by DiCaprio is as good as it gets In terms of sheer originality ambition and achievement Inception is the movie of the summer the movie of the year and the movie of our dreams world need directors like NolanSpielbergCameron As with his previous movies Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors who can best embody the characters in his films While DiCaprios role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island theres no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly Joseph GordonLevitt radiates confidence and suavity Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performanceBut Inception is Nolans vision through and through and in fact a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes Inception both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment just take the names of the various characters each of which have a special significance With Inception Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities possibilities of alternate realities of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly of the power of imagination It is that rare gem of a film that is so multilayered so profound and so fascinating that youll want to experience it again immediately after youve seen it just so you can fully appreciate its genius,Positive

Jurassic Park is a movie that I rewatch again and again and the believability factor reigns supreme Unfortunately with this I switched off from the very beginningPros Jeff Goldbloom Sam Neill somewhat nostalgicCons So many continuity errors entomological inaccuracies scientific inaccuracies no flow chaotic story telling such a tendency nowadays to overstimulate the audience rather than captivate them poor acting,Notr

Sony once again steps into the Marvel Universe running the experience and canonicity that Marvel and its movies have been preparing and perfecting for years now The films director even spoiled info from the movie prior to the release and admitted that most of the Easter eggs we see in the trailers were simply just ClickBait Enough is enough as long as people continue to see and support movies like this Studios will continue to trample on the art and visions that fans know and love Dont support SonyMarvel Movies,Notr
For many years I have wanted to see this movie I had heard various opinions praising the performances the scenery the soundtrack However I never got to see it until today And after seeing it I can affirm that it is a contender to be one of the best films in history There is no criticizable point Heath Ledgers performance is one of the best performances ever given on the big screen and even the secondary characters shine The city has a tone of horror suffering and fear just as someone would imagine Gotham and all this thanks to the excellent setting that this feature film presents both in terms of the scenery and the music composed by the famous Hans Zimmer Last but not least is the plot and I can firmly say that it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life I still cant assimilate how well the Jokers plans are made worthy of a crazy but charismatic and cunning villainIn conclusion ,Positive
Ya the movie is kind of dumb and crazy but also your on  of a dinosaur franchise So ya things are ridiculous but lots of cool action and definitely better then fallen kingdom that ones just dumb and not much redeeming in it,Notr

I first started watching Nolan movies with Memento like  years ago when I was a teenager then went to the cinema to see all three of his Batman movies The Prestige Inception and InterstellarI really think that it can be hard to decide which of his movies truly is his definitive best as he has a few that hit the mark just right But from rewatching them a bunch over the years I do feel that Inception hits the hardest even though Interstellar and The Dark Knight have their own weighty effect different from InceptionI watch movies for the magic and emotion and even though The Dark Knight is technically excellent and brilliantly acted the strengths of Inception edge it out slightly I thinkI love the cast of Inception especially the incredible performances of Joseph GordonLevitt Cillian Murphy Marion Cotillard and Ellen PageThose four actors in this movie are pure magic especially accented with Leo DiCaprio Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe along with everyone elseThe holy trinity of Nolan in my mind at least are Inception Interstellar and The Dark Knight with The Prestige and Memento not far behindI cant wait to see Nolan make an even greater magnum opus one to dethrone Shawshank Redemption from its imdb number  spot I feel that if any living director can do it it would be Nolan,Positive
Christopher Nolan has undoubtedly become one of the most important names in the business of contemporary filmed entertainmentHe has taken us to places we did not know existedHe singlehandedly revived a languishing cartoon franchise and placed it in the pantheon of unforgettable classics In his new adventure he takes on the uncharted universe of the subconscious The premise in its scope is intriguing and unconceivable ambitioushe relies on the best movie making talent only a major movie studio can buy to achieve his goalThe special effects are terrific the acting is pretty good and the dialogue is also good but the journey that started as an unrestrained adventure into the realms of the human thought generating universe turned half way thru into a tale of semi confusing scenes The story never comes anywhere near of seducing its audience The emotional factor is completely absentThe movie is worth watching and it does stand out mostly due to lack of quality competition but it should not be an Oscar nominee Christopher Nolan has done better work,Positive
Combine WreckIt Ralph with Inside Out then remove everything food about those movies and youre left with thisIts a movie about emojis its as terrible as you think it will be,Negative
This Movie Is An Insult To My Four Amazing CatsI had to go home and apologize to my cats for the infiltration of cat related garbage that I just allowed into my brainThe only two good things in the movie were the face makeup and Jennifer Hudsons version of Memories which you could see in the movie trailerSeriously  The Best Parts Are In The Trailer Just watch that  spare yourself  hours of your life that youll never get backMy husbands favorite part was when they all blew up in the end but then he realized that he dreamed that when he fell asleep during the movie and that was an even better ending than what we just watched,Negative
Im tired of people friken saying the movie is bad i thought it was really good one of the best movies this year actually and i dont care if people judge me going to the movie i expected something bad but the i got the idea out my mind and really enjoyed it the media is a bitch sorry for my language but it is you cant let some you tube video or some famous person tell u when something is bad thats the mistake i made but i learned make your own decisions people dont rely on others to make em for u stop being misled so easily u dont haft to agree with other people its not going to help u get popular thats why were all becoming dumber anyway i thought it was good also its towards kids so if your under like  u have a bigger chance of liking it so most of the people who said its bad either were misled by videos or are over  so yeah make your own choices people and this was mine,Negative

First thing first Inception is the best English sciencefiction film ever no doubt Christopher Nolan creates a world of multi layered dreams that tests the audience at every step While watching the movie I felt that I was part of something really special Go for it guys Do yourself a favor watch Inception I am not going to describe the story here as that is for you to find out But will advise you that it is not a film where you go with friends or girlfriend to have a party You have to watch very closely to get the flavor Nolan has certainly peaked and wont ever make a better form of celluloid masterpiece For me it is no  And I am sure that most of my friends will agree to it The entire starcast is also a winner along with the trillion dollar script,Positive
So so so terrible From acting to singing to plot it is all so horribly bad BUT the worse of all is the CGI and use of technology It doesnt even come close to looking good Things float and move around mostly their feet that it looks so laughableI recalled that I had heard it was bad but that was  years ago I didnt remember the what or why was bad about Heck the world experienced the COVID pandemic a few months after this movie was released Anway I received free HBO for the weekend saw this and decided that I had to see it for myself I wished I wouldve come to IMDb to reminded myself about the bad the comments and reviewsIm not making a joke here Im honestly surprised that HBO is even showing this still If any of these actors have any kind of selfrespect they would demand that this film is never shown again Stay away far away Wear a mask and dont get contaminated by this show,Negative

Huge fan of Jurassic Park Loved the story line and how they were successfully able to connect the past and new characters so well It was brilliant how they were able to bring back little bits from all the previous movies while adding a new dimension to this one Such a great film and so worth seeing in theater It goes to show how great the films have been and how great the fans have been when all the characters are willing to come back for a finale showdown,Notr

I saw the reviews before going to see this movie so I had low expectations but I gotta say this movie isnt that bad in fact its pretty good Its a TON of fun and the original characters add some life to this movie that felt missing from the other Jurassic World films The plot is the only thing that kind of doesnt work but even so its not bad its just passable The action scenes are amazing and the adventurous globetrotting feel of this movie makes it stand out from the others The dinosaurs of course are awesome and there are some touching scenes with them here In the end its kind of the dinosaurs themselves that are the emotional center of this film Best Jurassic movie since The Lost World,Notr

I went into this th instalment of the Jurassic saga with a lot of trepidation All the negative reviews had me lower my expectationsAnd you know what Its not as awful as everyone made it out to beNot as good as the original trilogy nor the th entry Jurassic World But its definitely miles better than Forbidden KingdomHaving the original trio of Neill Dern and Goldblum reprising their classic roles did bring more nostalgia than I anticipated Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard the heros of the new trilogy were definitely pushed into the backseat for this new filmBut it was fun popcorn entertainment with some stunning visuals and action packed set pieces laced with tensionSure the whole locust subplot felt out of place and stupid but it didnt impact my enjoyment one bitIts a fine addition to the franchise Maybe not the send off we wanted but not awful either,Notr
Sorry guys but this doesnt belong in the top s by any account Its fight scenes car chases its effects and its storyline were all mostly average Momentum wasnt built up over the film at all and worse they dragged out scenes longer then they should haveIn fact this movie was in the top  list BEFORE it made it to cinema Why Because there are a few people who are overly enthusiastic about batman who used Heaths death as a marketing tool overhyped the movie and voted it upwards despite never having seen it Just because a movie is based on a comic shouldnt mean it should be voted any differently would anyone have liked this movie if Batmans costume was swapped Yes heath was good because he played something out of his general character similar to how Jim Carrey did in Spotless mind But and s should be reserved for movies which are completely innovative I felt like I saw this movie x already and nothing kept me hanging on to find out what happened next People who voted this  possibly need to experience movies such as the shining Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind Fight Club or even WallE These are movies which provide the watcher with a different experience then what they are accustomed too and they are left wondering what will happen next,Positive

He really makes this movie His joker is iconic truly a bar to reach for for all other actors,Positive
This movie definitely has its strong points The visuals are good with the dinosaurs looking fantastic and its a real visual feast The action while maybe not the absolute best in the series is still a blast and keeps things exciting The performances are solid with Isabella Sermon stepping up her game from the last film and Jeff Goldblum adding a dose of humor Plus the nostalgia factor is pretty sweet and the movie keeps a good pace to keep you entertainedHowever the weak link here is the story Its not terrible but it doesnt quite live up to the potential set by the previous film The villains are a letdown they lack any real threat and are easily forgettable The narrative can feel all over the place as it jumps around from one place to another So overall it might be the most disappointing entry in the series but its definitely not the worst thanks to its strong visuals fun action solid performances and that touch of nostalgia from the series,Notr
Nolan delivers a true masterpiece This is easily one of the best movies of all time filled with mind bending sequences great writing and a visionary experience,Positive
Too much of everything Too much political drama too many dinosours everywhere too many characters that you are supposed to care about but you dont It would have been better to kill a few of them off early on to add some tensionBecause the dinosours are everywhere it has a numbing effect and you dont even care when they appearThe kid is super annoying The only positive thing about the movie is all the beloved characters from earlier movies including Dr Grant and Ellie although neither can save the movie I wish the movie had just mainly focused on these two and Ian it would have been enough and added nostalgiaThis was by far the worst of the franchise I would say All the other movies were at least OK Ive even seen all of them at least once in spite of serious flaws,Notr
Thanx to everybody who helped to put Shawshank back to rank  in the top  in front of LotR where it belongs Ive seen this movie about  times and I never get tired of it Thats what makes a movie the best The first  in the top  are where they belong The  LotRmovies should be out of the top  They should create a category for special effects Put them on top there But for a great movie it need a lot more then effects The story of Shawshank is absolutely great The actors did their best Its still a shame that this great movie didnt got a single Oscar It could have win the best picture in most years against all winners,Positive
One thing about doing a live adaptation of a Japanese series is that the contents tied to the original series is often removed and traded for changes that would hopefully strike a balance in appealing to the various different marketsThis was where Dragonball  Evolution totally failedNot only did the movie lose its fans of the original series through the various changes made it also failed to impress those who are new to the DragonBall nameDragonball  Evolution could be said to have no connection to the original DragonBall series at all except for the characters design and nameIn this case the title DragonBall is merely used as a advertising tool with non of the good points taken from the original seriesIf you are a DragonBall fan you would be disappointedIf you are not one you would hardly be entertainedThis movie failed to show seriousness but couldnt provide the laughs one would have expected even when taken as a comedic filmA prime example of a production train wreck that failed to live up to its name,Negative

What a great job on bringing back this story It is difficult to resurrect characters who have died in previous movies but this was well thought outIt doesnt drag on it keeps you guessing how they are going to create the connection throughout the movie and then brings it all together all while keeping you on the edge of your seat,Notr
The Matrix Resurrections does an adequate job of explaining HOW it exists as a sequel to the trilogy yet it doesnt really justify WHY it exists Its good to see Keanu Reeves and CarrieAnne Moss back in their respective roles although the rest of the cast and some of the action scenes are fairly forgettable This sequel also has the same pretentious tone the other sequels have None of them are as great as our first trip into The Matrix,Notr
What all the people trashing this umpteenth copy of a copy are forgetting is that it doesnt matter what you all think about the product All that matters is that you paid for it The people in this industry have incredibly lavish lifestyles to maintain Your  is merely th of a tank of petrol to take the lambo out for an afternoon joyride So suck it up buttercup and keep shelling out to check out photocopy  of INSERT MCU UNIVERSE SPINOFF here so that the industry suits can lord it over your sad little lives Those private jets dont fly themselvesThe movie starts out excellently then descends into wtf territory by suffering from a lack of tight editing of unnecessary scenessequences and story elements Couldve been a contender instead of a mostly forgettable addition to the series,Notr
This was the funniest film Ive seen all year Dont tell me it wasnt a comedy I know Dragonball and that WASNT it I was just waiting for the director to pop up at the end laughing and say Nah just kidding The real Dragonball movie comes out next year Fooled you Wed all let out a sigh of relief and rejoiceWorst lineGoku I must become one with twoNo Goku No you mustnt You need to have someone cut your tail off What you dont have a tail Well then I guess were all screwed Honestly just watch the anime Its a million times better than this and it doesnt have any of these stupid clichs,Negative
This splendidly visual film is not the nd coming nor will it best The Dark Knight at the box office On positive notes what this movie is is a splendidlyphotographed very wellscored strongly productiondesignedset decorated drama with straightforward acting that improves no brings out no lifts up the overlong screenplay Ellen Page deserves a supporting Oscar nom On negative notes some critics complain of too much exposition and several implausible scenarios Since Inception is all a dream within a dream within the implausible scenarios become plausible because theyre happening within dreams My complaint is that there is way too much studiomandated explosions gunfire and car chases Nolan may never be able to make another Insomnia or Memento in his career Hes the official Warner Brothers if not industry stalwart director The man with the Midas touch and the costprice of that moneymaking achievement is all the unnecessary studiomandated explosions gunfire and car chases that bloat InceptionOne last note Inception employs a cliffhanger possibly to ensure material for Warner Brothers sequel films that lacks resolution creating an anticlimax to a story in which the audience has invested  hours and twenty minutes,Positive
This movie had everything wrong The story was awful the characters were awful and the concept completely is stupid The movie shouldnt exist and the film felt like it led to nowhere The ending was also unsatisfying The jokes were corny and the character development leads to nowhere This film is a monstrosity and can possibly be considered as the worst film in cinema history The story was very unoriginal and the main villain had literally zero good motives become a villain in the first place The plottwist was awful as it led to nowhere And there were some characters I wish I never met in my life,Negative
Truly a masterpiece of cinema  I hope this film gets the critical recognition it deserves as the years go by  Almost everyone i have encountered has loved this film  How did it not win oscars galore  Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are simply perfect in what is essentially a love story  A love of hope a love of friendship and a love of life no matter the constraints  I LOVE THIS FILM,Positive
Selfreference on top of selfreference Time passes quickly in the first part of the film as you rack your brains to understand the scenario The second half is clearer and allows several elements of the quadrilogy to be tied together The fact that certain major characters are not played by the original actors makes understanding more complex but the numerous extracts from the first films make it possible to find them On the production side its good we keep the usual benchmarks but there are few innovations It wont be a remarkable film but it will please fans of the world of The Matrix I dont see the point of a sequel,Notr
this film is very convincing hokum nice gentle inoffensive and insubstantial story about prison life  I came away feeling prison was a place where nobody says fk or fears bending over to pick up the soap check out Freeman in the token performance of his career neatly basking in the falsely accused smart white gentleman robbins shaddow what a team so very progressive hope  oh yeah weve got a lot of hope going on here The lush fantasy kind so deadly sweet and full of bull frank darabont is a gifted man who excels in making pretty pictures that strike at the very heart of american pie values and gives them a welcome support by elevating tokenism to its greatest levels in hollywood yet  that is no small achievement considering if you dont believe me check out his latest masterpiece he just cant stop doing it hell why not it sells tickets,Positive

This film has great effects That is about all I can say because I found its plot instantly forgettable Slickly directed it is a visual treatLeonardo D is solid as usual Ellen Page is good but she suffers from looking too young to have qualified as an architectI would struggle to think of any reason to recommend this film to anyone to watch because beyond the sight of Paris folding over there is nothing else to recommend Not enough tension within the plot so I didnt actually care about the charactersLooks good but not a great film,Positive
 This movie has gender politics  Despite the shocking ratings for this movie its actually better than the other childrens release at the moment which also suffers from gender politics the Ninjago Movie Who is pushing sexism on young children Why is it always one sided sexism The Ninjago movie lacked heart The Emoji movie has heart especially due to T J Millers performance You end up liking most of the characters However the story is very predictable and leaves little to the imagination This is what separates this movie from a Pixar movie Pixar movies have heart and brainsIf you really have to pick a movie for the holiday season for your children get out an old movie so you dont have to deal with the gender politics why are men always taking credit for what women do type of garbage If youre desperate for a cinema experience pick the Emoji movie,Negative

"For a standalone sequel to the original trilogy I was impressed by how complete the movie feltDid it blow my mind No Did it leave me satisfied and entertained YesThis movie was so tongue in cheek that they had to borrow my mouth for extra room They made it obviousvery obvious from the get go that this movie was never supposed to exist For the entire first half of the movie and then some But still managed to make it feel like it belonged in the same reality as the previous films Despite the change in toneIt takes itself less seriously but I thought it workedTldr

I was surprised by all the bad reviews but decided to take a chance on this one anyway I was happy I did I think going in with lowered expectations helpedI saw a review that said if felt like cheap tv and that is correct most of the cinematography lends to a feel that they had to go the cheap route dark lighting the fight scenes lack a certain sharpness Think what it looks like to watch a soap opera vs seeing something on the big screen The production is way differentWithout giving anything away I think they did a good job explaining how and why there is another Matrix movie and how and why the characters are where they are It did feel rushed at times there is not much character development I think if you havent seen the previous movies this one wont make much sense as nothing is really explained in great detailI would definitely say this is the weakest of the  movies but still feels like it belongs in the universe I can see where they wanted this movie to go and am more than happy to follow along,Notr

When the trailer came out I too fell victim to the hate train hype this movie was building Is the movie good No Is it the worst thing ever Probably not I understand the hate this is getting seeing how absurd the subject matter is In execution it is less bad than it is just generic and forgettable Many people thought this would be a so bad its good flick Its not bad enough to pull that off Its also not bad enough to be insulting and painful to watch It really is just a generic kids film In my experience the movie went by pretty quickly and I never really felt too bored or offended Once the hate hype dies down no one will remember this film,Negative
The Shawshank Redemption is more than a filmits therapy for the soul It gently teaches patience resilience and the quiet strength of hope Andy Dufresnes journey through injustice and confinement is both heartbreaking and inspiring Morgan Freemans narration adds a calming reflective layer like a voice guiding you through your own struggles The story doesnt just entertainit heals Every frame reminds you that even in the darkest places light can break through Watching this film is like taking a deep breath after chaos It stays with you offering comfort perspective and above all the belief that hope is never wasted,Positive
First I want to say Where is the evolution in this movie Goku is already in a city at school and wanted girls not martial arts This is very stupid they made character awful Goku and girls  KameMaster Roshi is in center of lake in a big city and in a awful house Then all movie was talk searcing and so on when at final with Picolo fight that was just an not a big effect then movie is finish and  min   min uncut version of your life for nothing To bad they done this to the Dragon Ball anime that was amazing anime and it is today We hope that it will be another movie that is will be a very good one as the anime,Negative

Rarely does a film come along that feels like a cultural misstep of epic proportions but Cats  is undoubtedly one of the worst movies in cinema history Its not just badits a baffling cringeinducing spectacle that somehow manages to fail on every conceivable levelThe CGI is nightmarish creating grotesque anthropomorphic cats that are neither charming nor believable The storyif you can call it thatis a nonsensical mess of disconnected musical numbers with no clear direction or emotional resonance Even the cast which boasts an impressive lineup of stars seems uncomfortable delivering performances that range from awkward to downright embarrassingFrom the unsettling production design to the lack of any coherent artistic vision Cats is a disaster that defies explanation Its not just a bad movieits a cinematic trainwreck that will haunt audiences for years to come This is the kind of film that makes you question how anyone involved thought it was a good idea Cats isnt just a flop its a monumental failure in the history of filmmaking,Negative

Im not going to say that Dragonball Evolution is a great movie Far from it I havent really enjoyed anything Dragonball since before Dragonball Z and its episode fights and measuring contests in the form of power levels But I always enjoyed Dragonball the original creation of Akira Toriyama Its ludicrous but in a genuinely funny way and despite the standard evildoerwantstoruledestroytheworld motif it manages to stay lighthearted and funWhere this movie surprised me was how faithful it actually was to the story its based on Sure characters are missing its only a movie after all limited in time the Nimbus and Gokus rod are gone but the characters remained fairly faithful to the original concepts the basis of the story is here and the settings are great We get not only the populated areas but also the sparse wilderness and badlands the showcomic is known for Piccolos green we get to see some Saiyan ape Goku actionhonestly I dont know why actual fans of the original Dragonball complained so muchAll in all its not great but its watchable and fans of the original Dragonball should enjoy this as long as they keep expectations reasonable,Negative

WAY OVERRATED Makes you wonder if IMDb should rethink their ranking formula Id say Inception deserves a  or  But to be the  movie of alltime you need character development There was none Zero zip nada Were told that heres Leonardo and heres an Asian guy who wants him to go into a dream and thats it Boom now start the action I will say that the concept was very good It could have been a great movie if they would have left in some action but cut out about  minutes of it and substituted character and dreamsequencesplot rather than just wild chasesshootouts During these parts I found myself very bored,Positive

Dragonball Evolution is a cinematic masterpiece that exceeded all of my expectations From the stunning special effects to the incredible performances by the entire cast this film truly captures the spirit of the beloved anime and manga series The action scenes are intense and exhilarating and the story is both emotionally powerful and thoughtprovoking I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie and left the theater feeling completely satisfied If you are a fan of the Dragon Ball franchise you will not be disappointed This is a mustsee film for anyone who loves action adventure and a great story,Negative
If u ask me if any other super hero movie can have better plot than this one then ill say NO CrNOLAN as we all know is the best writer This movie has every thing A super hero a Badass smart villain a great story  some good acting Heath Ledgerjoker was awesome his acting was really remarkableFor me he was the best villain in the whole batman series Christian Balebatman is always good so no comments for him BATMAN is one of the most famous characters in DC comics so people have high expectations from this movieBut i assure you this movie will never disappoint you Joker is a villain with no super powers no advance gadgets but his intelligence is his greatest powerThis movie shows the real potential of joker  what he can do or how he creates fear in the mind of the people of whole Gotham city with only his intelligence  craziness The only thing is that this movie is a little bore in the start other wise this movie is very good  i would really love to watch it again  again,Positive

The film is of course not innovative and is also a film where two worlds come together And to finish it off well its not going well The cast of the first three films and the last two And then a story has to be made of it And thats where it goes wrong Just like the montages The story is also not accurate in time And the dolomites is a huge area And yet the beasts can get inside in a short time In short the film has to rely on the dinosaurs locations humor scary moments and good film images The film survives that Especially the scene with the water is beautifully filmed But the bad guy isnt a bad guy and it wont work out But its like transformers Dinosaurs save the movie So it remains sufficient,Notr
"This film is based on the smash Broadway musical and I thought it stayed fairly true to that show as I remember it So going in knowing that I enjoyed it Lots of reviews saying theres no plot not true There IS a plot albeit a very simple one The cats are vying for the chance at a new life by being chosen by Old Deuteronomy Judi Dench at the annual Jellicle Ball
I will admit there were a couple of weird moments like when Judi Dench raises her leg in the air after watching Gus the Theater Cats performance played sweetly by Ian McKellen But I thoroughly enjoyed all the performances the dancing and the singing Jennifer Hudson performing Memory as Grizabella will make you tear up I dont care who you are
If you are a fan of the musical you will probably like this movie If you know nothing of the musical you should probably acquaint yourself with it first otherwise none of it will make sense and you will think its just weird

Okay so they built a good villain in the Joker but the plot was just a bit too unbelievable to hold together Im not going to add any spoilers here but if you want a bigbudget action adventure escape that totally relies on the rendering farms that had to handle all the special effects and dont mind plotholes the Hindenburg could fly through this film is for you IMHO this film doesnt deserve all the hype Look at reviews from people who hated it and see why Once the hype has died down and people get over their brainwash to overrate this overproduced Hollywood crap we should see ratings more in line with the films true value I didnt walk out but that was because I had such high expectations Id hope to see this rated a  maybe even as high as a  by the average public Im rating this a  to try to offset the obvious shills and excessive hype This is by no means the best film of the summer but in its favor it does give better balance to the darkness of Batman If it werent for the growing trend in bucking the old feelgood Hollywood ending routine if it werent becoming clich to kill off good guys and create characters with seeming hearts of gold who turn halfevil Id say this film had something unique but that whole scenario is now a formula for making a film armchair critics will say has depth pffff Save your time and money and rent an old classic favorite that you somehow never managed to see Or go have a picnic with your loved ones The alternative is twoandahalf hours you wont get back dont waste it to further enrich Warner Bros,Positive
This movie was and is beloved by everyone so I dont expect to make any friends with my honest opinion  I was not impressed by Inception Before I first watched this film I was told that it would be complex and mindblowing so I expected something like Nolans earlier The Prestige  which was masterful and one of my favourite films Instead we get a shallow imitation of that style Inception is complex just for the sake of being complex  it doesnt add much value to the film and the complexity is just overloading the audiences working memory which is not a clever technique at all The characters were the worst part of the film Apart from the main characters they basically have no existence outside their role in the mission We dont have any other reason to care about them After a point I just completely stopped caring whether they succeeded Nothing felt compelling or of much consequence I actually cared more about Cilian Murphys character than the protagonists to be honest Because I lost my investment in the film it just dragged out and became boring especially some of the generic action scenes like the one in the snow The ending is just cheap ambiguity rather than anything meaningful That said there were some good things about the film that I enjoyed The visuals and effects were great such as the transforming cities and the zero gravity The best part was Hans Zimmers score which remains one of my favourite soundtracks Those aspects almost made up for the flaws  almost,Positive

What a horrid movie One of the few movies that unfortunately made it in the  billion dollar club Jurassic World was fun despite its flaws Fallen Kingdom was just kind of eh but this is an absolute disaster Its just sunk down a downward spiral that leads to hell Its bad enough to the point Im pretty convinced it was made more for money than it was for an actually good movie and thats sad I dont care for this movie or this franchise anymore the creative team leaders certainly didnt so why should I One year later and nobody talks or cares about it But sadly people will take advantage of the money they made and make some more Jurassic Park garbage Why did people flock to see it WHY Everybody Ive talked to who watched it instantly regretted buying tickets for this and not some other movie What a piece of garbage,Notr

When i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like After watching it i thought it was a brilliant filmfantastically acted with greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton Very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time At the end it made me cry and thought about life Every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye Fantastic film and worth watchingits really realistic film and another one of stephen kings great stories a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing  if you havent seen this film already then watch it it is brilliant just brilliantbe prepared to be moved its such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours A truly lovely magical film my favourite of all time fantastic,Positive
Absolutely terrible My wife and I decided we would ignore the bad reviews and see it and form our own opinion What a mistake Whoever casted this movie should be confined to a  room with  cats and a huge basket of catnip,Negative
The first act is a clever and tightly edited setup that does a great job at hinting that there is a larger idea behind this movie an idea about the state of the world post trilogy that needs Neo to returnThen the movie hits an almost literal wall It just stops People start expositing a lot and its awkward obtuse dialog too often in complete silence like a homemade movie without a score Characters act but with the exception of Neo we dont understand why Interesting developments about the posttrilogy world are introduced but just as quickly as theyre mentioned they cease to matter From this point forward good guys are good because theyre good bad guys are bad because theyre bad and they play their parts like hollow automata around Neo trying to reach TrinityThis transition between the first act and the rest of the movie is black and white A real pity,Notr
I rated Jurassic World Dominion with a seven because I like that kind of movies adventures with prehistoric animals but in all fairness the story wasnt the greatest It was much too exaggerated much too simple at times and the acting was sometimes not that great either Ive never been a big fan of Chris Pratt think hes just a mediocre actor and that didnt change with this movie And Laura Dern isnt an actress I appreciate a lot either so those two combined isnt a success formula for me The only reason I score it this high maybe too high is because of the CGIs which were very good and thats what made it entertaining Maybe its time to call it a day with the Jurassic franchise At one point enough is enough,Notr
With all the negative reviews I was expect bad things however I was pleasantly surprised sure you could see the plot a mile away But it was entertaining amazing special effects well acted definitely worth a watch,Notr

The Shawshank Redemption should have won Best Picture for  A story of banker Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison the movie is beyond amazing In prison Andy meets Ellis Boyd Red Redding Morgan Freeman who was imprisoned many years earlier Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth Over the next twenty years Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail beatings by the guards rapes by other inmates and so on But he never gives up hopeThis movie like Carrie The Shining Dolores Claiborne The Green Mile and Hearts in Atlantis just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is When we think of horror we think of spooky horror but The Shawshank Redemption is a different kind personal horror Pure genius I can only hope that in the coming years this movie is recognized as what it is a masterpiece I cant believe that it won no Oscars,Positive
what did I just watch This is the worst animated movie I have ever seen in my life This movie was worse than foodfight and Mars Needs Moms and this was worse than Minions This was even worse than the trailers This movie was worse than I thought it would be The thing that really angers me is that they canceled the Popeye movie for this crap movie Do not go see this in theaters You will waste your money I am saving you and your money All of the jokes were not funny and the whole movie was so stupid,Negative
It takes audiences on an unforgettable cinematic journey exploring the indomitable human spirit and the pursuit of redemption Tim Robbins delivers a compelling performance as Andy Dufresne a man wrongfully convicted and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary Through his unlikely friendship with Red portrayed brilliantly by Morgan Freeman the film delves deep into the complexities of human connection and the transformative power of hope Frank Darabonts directorial finesse brings Stephen Kings novella to life painting a poignant portrait of resilience amidst a harsh and unforgiving prison environment With its thoughtprovoking themes stellar performances and emotionally resonant storytelling Finding Redemption The Shawshank Journey continues to captivate audiences earning its place as one of cinemas most beloved and timeless classics,Positive
I loved this movie Beautifully filmed the story is told as if time does not matter No plot that has to be rushed through no fast cars or anything Just a very good story by Stephen King marvellous actors and a lot of exciting emotions It made me feel good to watch a man who keeps his hope for so many yearsThe scene with the Mozartrecord broke my heart,Positive
I give it a ten I am watching it for my birthday and I just cant wait Ahhh Im so excited to see it I love how the movie is made so perfectly I think this is a movie for all ages and Jacksfilms would think so too I absolutely love this movie and I just want to see it so bad OH MY GOD I CANT WAIT AHHHHHHHHHHHH,Negative

I have nothing to say about the plot because I slept through the movie That Rum Tum Tugger though it was just Jason Derulo in a cat costume so I found it funny Its a shame that they used Taylor Swift as a pure promotion tool She was there for like less than  mins for real My god I hate myself watching this on Christmas day,Negative
Dear God where do I even begin This is the most perfect film I have ever seen There was not a single moment that felt drawn out I had been long overdue for a watch of this film and I regret not watching it sooner Ive never finished a film and immediately wanted to watch it again until nowThis film is the story of a man told through the eyes of another man The original Stephen King story was phenomenal and I must say that this film surpasses it Without the source materials limitations on what Red could reveal he had to make assumptions The Shawshank Redemption in my opinion stands as the pinnacle of cinema,Positive
"The makers of this movie were so preoccupied with whether they could make it that they didnt stop to think if they shouldBloated plot lines even more bloated cast that they couldnt think what to do with shameless pandering to the fans of the original by shoehorning in Grant Sattler and Malcolm and retconning new pointless characters
The plot has zero continuity and the acting dont get me started on the acting Not even Sam Neill could inject any life into this pile of pointless garbageIf you are not  years old or you are a fan of the original movies you should avoid this at all costs",Notr

First and foremost Hollywood needs to stop casting Jared Leto in superhero movies He is not a multifaceted actor with the depth to take on such rolesMorbius as a film was a mess The characters were bland the special effects were atrociously poor the slow motion action scenes were blatantly unnecessary and only added to its watered down runtime This could have been a well made movie had it been done by a different director with a more definitive thought out vision and a better lead actor As it currently stands Morbius is undoubtedly the worst film in its cinematic universe,Notr
Iconic The Dark Knight directed by Christopher Nolan is a cinematic tour de force that redefines the superhero genre Released in  this film stands as a testament to the transformative power of storytelling and the impact of exceptional performances At its core Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary Ledgers posthumous Academy Awardwinning performance elevates the character beyond a mere antagonist making the Joker a symbol of chaotic brilliance and anarchyChristian Bale reprising his role as Bruce WayneBatman brings a brooding intensity that complements the films exploration of duality and morality Nolans direction is masterful creating a gritty and realistic Gotham City that becomes a character in itself The cinematography coupled with Hans Zimmers haunting score adds layers of tension and depth to the narrativeThe Dark Knight transcends the typical superhero narrative evolving into a crime thriller that delves into the complexities of heroism The films social commentary on the thin line between order and chaos resonates throughout challenging audiences intellectually and emotionally As the capstone of Nolans Batman trilogy The Dark Knight sets a high standard with its thoughtprovoking narrative exceptional performances and cinematic brillianceThis film isnt just a comic book adaptation its a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll Its impact on the superhero genre is undeniable and its legacy continues to influence filmmakers setting a standard that few have matched The Dark Knight remains a beacon of excellence reminding us that a superhero film can be both entertaining and intellectually stimulating leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern filmmaking,Positive
I think others have been to harsh Yes its familiar territory but well edited good acting and some laughs spot The Shining reference I thought the running time would be too long but it my attention throughout Screen time is well shared among the cast and the sub plots work well together Nice to see Laura and Sam get together at the end and and Isabella Sermon and Wanda deWise are very watchable Some people really need to chill out and just eat their popcorn,Notr
Awful experience complete none senseMy family will never forgive me for having them loose  hour  minutes,Negative
I must be like getting old and jaded or something I found the movie predictable and more straightforward than I hoped it would beA good alternative name for the film would have been Wait what as if there was any less action youd be constantly asking yourself why the eff they didnt do X or why Y didnt happen etc The word contrived will keep nudging at your brain if youre not doing an exceptional job of suspending all disbelief along with all common senseThe final scene of the film was rather obvious from early on I thoughtI found it relatively easy to follow exactly what I was expecting and totally lacking in interesting Sixth Sense plot twists Everything pretty much was as it was presented to beNot sure how this makes it to  on the alltime best listThe Matrix was way more entertainingG,Positive
If the makers of Tuscan Milk and the creators of the Three Wolf Moon shirt decided to make a film Emoji Movie would be the result Bright crisp fluid animation meets the modernday version of Shakespeare though nowhere nears as boring The characters almost leap off the screen as they are so believable Then with such an allstar cast including Stifflers mom STIFFLERS MOMThe DVD and BluRay sales are going to be OFF THE CHARTS I would suggest preordering whatever deluxe steelbook k edition now as to not disappointment little Bobby or Suzie on Christmas morning In the meantime I would suggest multiple rewatches Heck find a homeless person and take them with you to see this film It is so awesome and lifechanging that when they are through witnessing this triumph of entertainment the will no longer be a hoboI really wish I had more stars to give,Negative
How many time the same story will be copied over and over again Its an copy from their own previous marvel stories Lab experiment something wrong super power Hero a villain a fight for good How in the hell the story is accepted in the first place to direct a movie Is it not clear they its a repeat of a repeat of a repeat Total brainless people involved in this project Very very bad,Notr
Who green lit this crap This is not the Jurassic ParkWorld we all know and love This is some CIA operative action flick with underground dinosaur markets and new terrible characters that make no sense Yes they bring back the old characters but they are used in a completely different type of side story The bad guys are an added part that just take over the story So this movie is less about dinosaurs and more about bad people trying to take over the world Nothing saves this movie I am so glad we watched this when it was free cause its absolutely terrible Dont waste your time Just to reach the max words needed again its terrible,Notr
This movie didnt need to be made and it doesnt live up to any of the first three in the trilogy Its like everyone phoned it in  the actors the writers the directors SadSome of the main characters from the original got shortshrifted and that to me was the biggest disappointment and unforgivableUnoriginal unexciting and unfathomable why someone thought this was a good idea Three stars only because Keanu is in it,Notr
If you want to see an amazing crimedrama The Emoji Movie is for you It contains a dazzling story a insanely beautiful musical score and well developed characters Id reccomend this movie if you like The Godfather and its sequels Though when you compare the Godfather and Emoji Movie the God Father almost seems like a shameless rip off yet it came first I would show it to my kids if I had some,Negative
Of course I had heard lots about this movie and actually love track  from the OST by Zimmer but Id never made an effort to go watch it Something in my mind told me it wouldnt be worth it Besides Im not much impressed by DiCaprios acting skillsStill after a long while I wanted to see what the fuss is about I am checking out numerous films people recommend as best of  to meInception was waaaaay too shallow for me Its a superficial action film that admittedly looks visually nice but theres no real drama It actually bored me Left me coldIf you want to see a  film including DiCaprio go see Shutter Island Much much better but not great which is too badAnyway I dont want to spend too many words on this Inception creation Yawn,Positive
Worst movie ever So bad my wife left to go shopping,Negative
I mean I get how cool dinosaurs in a car chase in a city sounded but it just didnt work There were a lot of places where I could tell the director thought I would be overjoyed with nostalgia but nothing felt earned I thought Chris Pratt barely got the raptors he trained for years to stop with his magic had motion but suddenly it works in every dinosaur on planet earthThe story was so weak Im surprised anyone thought it was worth making Oh wait no Im not it seems like executives heard nostalgia and thought nostalgia equals money and we love money Well I like good stories Too bad you didnt try for that,Notr
People look for all sorts of things in movies and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie  Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen  Others are action junkies  Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot or the niftiest angle  For all of these there is the very real chance that they simply will not get this film and thats too bad  they are missing out on a classicAt its best film can transcend merely being a series of pictures no matter how pretty and can reach down and touch people  That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly  It is not the fastest moving movie not the edgiest not the grittiest it is filmed in shades of gray  But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done  And THAT is filmmaking at its finest  Not a game not eye candy  this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled,Positive
This movie spends about  of screentime building the environment and story I wouldve rather the movie be about an hour longer to actually do what I expected from it,Notr
People are hating on this for no good reason The performances were great and the dancing was exceptional These are some of the principal dancers from the Royal Ballet people If you are a dancer or a fan of dance you will love this movie If you hate musicals and dance why did you watch it to begin with,Negative
As you can tell I loved this movie it was very funny and interesting Im joking I would rather k I l l m y s e l f then watch this ever AGIAN,Negative
Jokes aside this was a movie that was really curious for me The idea was fantastic trying to find an equilibrium with dinosaurs after the genie is out of the bottle However the execution was really choppy each scene was as unbelievable as the next and that has to be the fault of Colin the director It makes me miss the first Jurassic World movie which I thought was the weakest but he executed it already well thereMaybe its time constraint or stuff but I appreciate the effort by everyone involved Its a good ending but really could have been a blockbuster and it probably would in the box office but not a blockbuster that Jurassic  and  were or even Fallen Kingdom,Notr
The movie seemed much shorter than it really is because it was constantly moving There werent any inappropriate lulls There was some corny humor but definitely not enough to spoil the actual funny parts Great effects of course Bulma did a wonderful job as main character although it seems odd that she becomes so comfortable with gokus presence in her life in such a short amount of time Theres a lot of parts that are totally unreal but I guess if youre going to see a movie about machines that turn into rational robots you cant expect too much reality For those who tend to pick apart movies there are a lot of unexplained instances throughout the movie that you can mull over later but all in all a must see in the movie theaters Hopefult theyll be a sequel PS did you do thatYeah I did,Negative
This movie offers less in terms of plot twists character development and acting than what I think people realise Morgan Freeman delivers a characteristically mundane performance and the other characters dance forgettably around himThere are few to no memorable quotes and even less action and the only real twist at the end could be the most overrated twist of all timeI only watched this after it was deemed a must by most of my close peers and fellow movie critics only to be gravely disappointed with their judgments If this movie has taught me anything it is that IMDb ratings mean jack and that people are in general conformist in nature  they rate movies highly if their fellow humans talk it up Who could forget the terrible acting and the sexual innuendos in this movie The only reason that the director put that in there was to make it feel more prison like but for me it felt as if he was trying to plug a bathtub with a million holes A tub full of vomit to begin withFrankly I do not care if this is an unpopular view And neither should you Popularity is a reflection of the current state of societys desires nothing more,Positive
The movies message is that communication among people is failing and can only be saved by texting with more emojisHow about face to face conversations,Negative

I dont know exactly why it is underrated Yeah it is mostly crappy and lacks substance but still it reaches to put a smile on your face Theres low chances you may have no fun watching it Its entertaining intriguing and keeps you engaged throughout it I thought the average meh ratings would be  or  but are below that Anyway dont let reviews fully influence you to watch or not a film In the end its up to you and you have the choice whether to see it or not,Negative
One hour and  minutes you have to wait to hear Jennifer Hudson  Will this become a Star Wars Christmas special that is only seen once in the world,Negative
Its always difficult to choose a favourite movie out of all the movies I have seen but I really believe that this is the one When I first watched it I had not read the Stephen King novella and had no idea what was going to happen which made it much more enjoyable to watch Of course like any movie this was not flawless but was such a terrific emotional experience for someone who is seldom moved by cinema This was such a cinematic triumph and I couldnt believe that it didnt win any of its seven nominations at the Oscars The performances were wonderful captivating the mood of the film to sheer perfection Nothing against Forrest Gump but it should have been easily outclassed for Best Picture It was also a good movie but just nowhere near as memorable as this one,Positive
Iit justI cantII got nothingTheatre is theatre for a reason,Negative
Many who are not familiar with the Broadway show or staging might not understand the structure of the show This could explain some of the negative comments I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the performances were great Highly recommend this whimsical tale,Negative
The movie was a great success The main character was very positive in all three aspects In despair also do not give up and through years of efforts to escape from prison to punish the wicked The movies main character allows himself to bring a little hope to the dark prison,Positive
My  years old son loved the entire movie He likes the raptors and the dynasours fightsAs for me who watched all the previous ones it felt it is just purely commercial addition They brought the old cast back with no clear role compared to SpiderMan no way home where it was funny and has a purposeOverall still entertaining for new generation,Notr
The cinematography action and acting are good but the script is terrible Almost everything is predictable and the plot becomes increasingly unbelievable and illogical Overall I have to say that the film is okay at the beginning but becomes increasingly annoying as it progresses I wont watch it again,Positive
This movie Im not going to call this film the IMDb  movie but I really cant deny that this is fantastic The cast the score the writing and the power are all here in this film and filled with strength Its one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over It is about a friendship a life an evil and a hope A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls We see these people as years of time goes by We see friendships grow and topics change It really puts you in the prison and makes you feel whats like to behind those bars You feel the friendship the hope the darkness and the pure horror of it all stars out of ,Positive
Honestly i understand why people usually dont like this film It has no faithfullness to the manga and anime and it has a very lame script But a long time ago when i was a DB fan i liked this film I enjoyed watching it And i also liked to see the differences between this and the source materialOn the technichal level it was pretty good The scenarios are goodlooking and the fight choreographies are pretty goodWhat makes me sad about this film is that people hate it as if it was a second holocaust As if this film caused any death And they exaggerate This film is decent but honestly i would watch it if the showed it on TV,Negative
I dont know what all these low reviews Ive watched all Marvels movies and i felt that is one of them I really shocked with it  over all rate  I said to my self yeah  if it is marvel product would take at least  out of ten However i dont like these very handsome men in an action type and may be my first time to watch Gared Leto but i enjoyed the movie so much,Notr

Its times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the shelf Its been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad the worst review Ive given in weeks was a  to Flightplan This film obviously didnt break my streakI went into it knowing next to nothing only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time that it was based on a story by Stephen King and that it took place in a prison Needless to say it blew me away I wont say a thing about the plot just so that others whove yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me I will say this though It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see One in particular stands out above the restNot much can be said about the actors that hasnt been said Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career and even though Ive only seen  or  other Tim Robbins movies Im sure the same can be said for himThough I dont agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made it was still a very good very well made very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film,Positive
This film didnt spook me when i was young now with my adult brain this film is super intense and psychological The most amazing part is its never boring I didnt check my phone like i usually do This film made me jump i forgot about the joker killing the fake batmans offVery good film Better than no way home Im so glad my brain forgot about most of this film because it was like brand new to me And I LOVED IT SO MUCH,Positive

The Emoji Movie is an exciting adventure with memorable characters and complete with hilarious jokes and clever themes Oh sorry thats what you WISH it was This movie is so unbelievably terrible that Sony had to put SO much effort into SpiderMan Into the SpiderVerse just to make up for this piece of Sir Patrick Stewart who by the way plays a poop emoji Thats pretty much the movie in a nutshell But if you want a more extensive answer the movie is boring the characters are forgettable the script is awful the jokes are cringeworthy the premise is beyond stupid the animation is just OK and the less I say about the bucketload of product placement the better This may just be the worst animated movie of all time,Negative
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good  or in this case brilliantAlthough the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the s I can easily imagine it being transferred to todays time and standards The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors and writers of course didnt use extreme clichs  theres no black and white painting just numerous shades of grey Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles as are all of the supporting actorsFinally I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking,Positive
Sorry but this movie just doesnt do it For me the best Batman movie is in fact the first one with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson But thanks to Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine I stayed til the end of the movie The other actors including Bale were very below average I saw all superheroes movies but the worst one is this one At the top of my list is SpiderMan  it just got better and better since the first movie Batman does not deserve to beat all those records at the box office What a pity  Iron Man was good very good The Incredible HULK was OK but I prefer the first HULK with Bana I do not know but for me to be entertaining a movie needs to have a soul which is not the case for Tha Dark Knight Dsol its a bad movie That is all I have to say,Positive
A good movie and it is almost a good sequel I loved the events and the plot Frankly the movie was able to convey the feelings of the characters It has good characters and also the dialogues Each dialogue The movie reminds you of some of the parts before and frankly they presented the dialogues in a smooth and enjoyable way and praised the element The evil in the film which was presented to us by Neil Patrick which was surprisingly good but I did not like the speed in the transition between events I felt that everything happened quickly and also I did not like the story of the film which was bad looking at the seasons before but the film is good and deserves to be watched strongly but before watching it you should watch the parts that came before to remember the events,Notr
