Its just amazing that no dinosaur hasnt bitten it off yet In what promises to be the conclusion to the series all the main cast members of the previous shows are here Alan Grant Ellie Sattler I actually liked the new characters DaWanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie better than the old ones  they are the only ones that come out of this unscathed The special effects are as expected first class although really A Gigilomopoloposaurus  they just keep getting bigger the dinosaurs AND the names Not sure that its worth the Hollywood BlvdTimes Sq ticket prices   but its an okay way to spend a summer afternoon I think tho Id wait til next weekend when the crowds will be  less,Notr
This movie was so utterly predictable it was a little painful Luckily the nostalgia nods were sprinkled throughout and mostly not forced You can tell they tried to have some funny oneliners which fell flat a lot of the time They need to take some notes from Marvel on those The CGI and action was as good as youd expect and offered favorable intensity The story itself was somewhat lazy IMO Did I mention it was totally predictable I left the theater goingmeh,Notr
I will say this for Colin Trevorrow unlike other Hollywood writersdirectors who seem to be actively spiteful towards the classic sagas they are writing sequels to when Trevorrow says he is a fan of Jurassic Park I believe himThats why Jurassic World Dominion feels for good and for ill like the worlds most expensive fan film cramming in nearly every dinosaur known to man and every character meme and injoke from the previous five movies button up your shirt Malcom Get your hat Grant Oh look Nedrys old Barbasol canIm betting that if the great Pete Postlethwaite had not passed away we would have gotten Roland Tembo rappelling from a helicopter to shoot an Oviraptor in the faceThe movie is at least twenty minutes too long  Hollywood seems incapable to make a nonbloated blockbuster today even Bond movies have the running time of The Thin Red Line  and it doesnt have a shred of the wit and intelligence of my beloved first Jurassic Park but I did like a few setpieces the Therizinosaurus the frozen lake and its always nice to see the awesome Sam Neill back so I guess the fan bait worked to an extent,Notr
Bad script bad acting stupid story a new dinosaur every  minutes too long no suspense Chris Pratt doing the hand thing  million dollar budget for this so many pointless dinosaur fights AND you took  and a half hours to tell me this garbage storyFrankly embarrassing to everyone involved,Notr
Was it perfect No Was it fun Absolutely There will be a lot of things people will pick apart this movie for I for one didnt mind it It was a solid closing chapter to the Jurassic World trilogy It was a nice balance with the newer stars and the OGs A lot of hey I know you from such and such When the casts get combined I was so happy I love my OG Jurassic Park crew They were my main reason for being excited and I wasnt disappointed in that regard A lot of fun sequences really helped keep me entertained It couldve been a bit shorter but Im still happy with what I got from it Go in to have fun It wont do you any good going in expecting a masterpiece Plus it has a ton of baby dinosaurs they were sooooo cute,Notr
I personally enjoyed the film Will everyone like it NoI liked catching up with the old characters and I liked the dinosaur designs The story was a continuation as expectedI had fun,Notr
Before I went to this film because my Grandson is nuts about this series of films I read one newspaper review It wasnt glowing but it was positive Unfortunately this is a mess Others have already talked about the issues I have Granted this is an empty headed summer movie it could still have been done with some serious thought I was hanging in there throughout with a new dinosaur attack every three minutes and velociraptors going at fifty miles per hour and not getting tired Humans being assaulted time after time and yet showing no fatigue I also didnt see a scratch on any of them But the best of all was the promise made to a baby dinosaur and his mother that precluded saving the world from famine Not to mentioned the coincidences of everyone showing up in just the right places I still dont understand how they got into that facility so easily The return of the original cast was not helpful other than Jeff Goldblums sarcasm Anyway its all been said This is a poor movie,Notr
Yeah its another one of the World editions of Jurassic ParkIts really cheesy like all the World movies but its still entertaining This one has a really weak story which you figure out almost within minutes of the movie The dinos are so very much in the background here compared to the other movies,Notr
While this movie isnt perfect it doesnt deserve the hate it receives online There are some laughable and cringey scenes but overall the movie has some great shots and was very fun and enjoyable,Notr
This movie attempts to exploit the nostalgia of the original characters and it fails miserably at every level The action the editing the direction its all terrible The movie has no focus too many characters that have nothing to do and nothing to do with each other The only positive thing I can say about this movie is they did use plenty of real props for some of the dinosaurs so its not like the actors are always looking at a green screen However everyone just feels kind of disconnected from the movie Like everyone involved knew the script was trash and the movie would just be a cash grab because they knew idiots like myself would go and see it Oh well Just Hollywood doing what they do best,Notr
I read review after review of bad this is how there are no dinosaurs how the plot sucksso I thought OK I wont see itbut my son wanted to go so I took himThose reviews were SO OFF There are as many dinosaurs in this as there were in ANY of the JPJW films Its an absolutely blast Its a really fun exciting summer movie How heartfelt and amazing does the plot have to be Its a summer blockbuster and as a fan of the original JP films I thought it was great Dont blindly trust reviews  see for yourself,Notr
Mixed bag of greatness and mediocre A really enjoyable blockbuster for what it is has some poor dialogue in some scenes and a little cheesy bits with the boss of Bryson The cast though is excellent cinematography is amaze balls and theres plenty of awesome high budgeted action sequences throughoutI loved a lot of it though I must say its great fun especially in IMAX There was even a great QA I got to see was silly when someone said finally when that ended I was thinking why pay for the longer version with extras if you dont want to see that aspect some dont make sense I crave any special feature Id work on film if I could and Id say Jurassic World Dominion is a worth seeing,Notr
I absolutely hated this film legacy characters used as bait for box office numbers a horrible plot that makes the incredibly long runtime absolutely insufferable The actors arent at fault the visuals are good as you might expect from a movie this expensive but the script is atrocious and the epic conclusion is not very much a conclusion the main issue is not solved and everything that was wrong in the previous films is just elevated in this film absolutely terrible film dont watch it,Notr
So it wasnt the best Jurassic movie  that will always be the original and best but it was choc full of dinosaurs some old some new and the two casts got together  it was just good fun and I believe they wrapped it up well,Notr
Lets face it it could be better Not the best Jurassic movie but yet I liked it Im a big fan of Jurassic park and I was really happy when they announced the Jurassic world My childhood came to lifeFor this movie I knew it wasnt going to surprise me but I wanted the end I wanted to say goodbye to my beloved dinos And even it wasnt the best I was pretty satisfied I think we got a lot of closures Maisies origin much more dinos than ever old actors back together and their own moment D and I was really glad for Henry he always wanted to do something incredible and most of time it didnt work but this time he gets his redemption Overall its not the best but it did make my heart flutter one last time Still loves the franchise and I hope for those who loved the original trilogy will find the same satisfactory like I didLife always finds a way this time we were given coexisting world when dinos live with us I dont know about you guys but I was more than okay with the ending like this ,Notr
Was it perfect No Was it as good as the Original No Was it a fun film that you could just sit back and enjoy Yes The tension and thrills as well as a solid conclusion to all the characters new and the old ones that didnt get a decent ending in the original trilogy made it enjoyable enough The dialogue was poor at times there is no denying it but overall solid action and conclusive,Notr
This latest Jurassic installment doesnt bring much did the table that we havent already seen before While it was nice seeing the original characters reunite the film lacked any sort of charisma compared to the previous films Not even ONeill Dern or Goldblum could elevate the material Lastly the dinosaur battles felt pedantic and uninspired Overall no great Spielbergian Whoa moments ,Notr
Jurassic World Dominion feels like it became a selfparody during the first act of the movie Sure its nice that theyre referencing the past movies in kind but the lapses in logic the annoying deusex machinas at play the apparent brainlessness of some of the characters and the dinosaurs becoming part of Earths everyday socioeconomic hemisphere it was a wasted opportunity and felt like a misleading tease from Fallen KingdomThere was potential here uniting two generations of Jurassic Park casts uniting the dinosaurs in their fight for survival and maybe even showing the fallout of such a situation where dinosaurs now actually coexist alongside peopleThe Jurassic franchise has definitely exhausted all possibilities at this point in time but I think we KNOW Universals are least considering another sequel to this conclusionWhat next Jurassic Stars Where they take the dinosaurs literally to outerspace or something At least thatd provide some more ironic entertainment and become a midnight movie phenomenon,Notr
This is the first of the JW trilogy that actually resembles the legendary brilliance of the original JP in certain forms While it still does suffer from certain clichs and scattered random plot choices its definitely the most chaotic and entertaining since the original The dinosaurs are more fearsome than ever and definitely make the ride that much more intriguing with cgi that is highly precise The old and new cast blending works fairly well Though can be somewhat forced at times with the comic relief The original actors definitely add that bit of fan service we all know would come along with them I still dont think this trilogy was as good as it couldve been it does close out in a very solid fashion,Notr
I enjoyed the action little jump scare and the og characters Also lived the new dinos and characters I wish people appreciated movies more I really recommend people dont listen to the bad reviews caie you might enjoy it,Notr
Felt awesome sounded awesome what else do you need If I had to criticize a bit our main characters didnt feel like they were the main and also the movie could have been a bit shorterI cant wait to own this on K And if I had time Id definitely like to watch this once again in cinemas,Notr
This is my least favorite of all the Jurassic movies The original was excellent and fun This was an excuse to have a reunion The movie cant stand on its own I watched it with someone who had never seen any of the previous Jurassic movies He didnt get it I thought we were passed films that allowed the stars to keep their makeup on after swimming through algea covered ponds Not even camp enough to be fun,Notr
I thought this movie was a seven average Ive seen better Jurassic Park movies fallen kingdom is better I thought that the storyline was a bit lazy but I quite enjoyed the way that this was presented I thought it was rushed other than that its a seven for me and thats being generous because I thought it was okay I didnt think it was pulling up trees I thought they would be a lot better than what it was I was quite disappointed to be honest I should rate it a little bit lower because the seven is being generous but I quite enjoyed it and it was okay I didnt mind it could be a lot better than what it was,Notr
The movies plot doesnt feel contrived While it may be simple and predictable for those of us whove watched hundreds of movies those that have not aka children love the movie The jump scares work the threats seem real and the acting is top notch Yes the actors did amazing given what little they had to work with in a movie about dinosaurs in real lifeCheck your suspension of disbelief at the door and have fun reliving your childhood or creating new memories watching a Jurassic park movie for the first time,Notr
A passable film as far as visual effects are concerned but the story and characters are both underwhelming For me it is the worst film of the saga it does not reach the sufficiency,Notr
The new Jurassic World movie has got to be one of the worst big budget hollywood film I have seen in quite a while The old returning actors are not enough to save the clunky dialogue or the absolutely pointless story here As a conclusion to this trilogy it fails in a majority of areas Worst of all in addition to being sloppily put together is its beyond derivitive I honestly feel like Ive seen the majority of these story tropes used in a vast catalog of other much better films Also it has one of the worst villians Ive seen put to screen His acting and the dialogue for his character was about the equivilant of a  year old throwing a tantrum Beyond annoying and even more unrealistic The special FX werent even anything awesome just more of the same However I do have to give it up to the team that did the creature designs for the practical FX those were more impressive I would recommend waiting for streaming it wasnt even worth seeing on the IMAX as the majority of scenes were not worthy of the scale  a dino out of ,Notr
I really liked this one A nice hommage with its own style Old school summer blockbuster with an interesting story and great dinosaur effects both practical and digital Just sit back and enjoy the ride,Notr
Now I said it already  best Jurassic movie so far  and ok Ill happily admit I didnt have too high expectations because I didnt like the previous two installments much tbh but this one at first I was thinking pretty slow start followed by but hey theyre actually building up a pretty good story that makes me care about what happens to the characters next and with a drive of a star wars or James Bond movie keeping your attention and with pretty good CGI supporting the story not the other way around No honestly this felt like a more mature Jurassic movie compared to previous ones I really enjoyed this one and left the movie theatre with a big smile on my face  this is what a night at the movies is all about,Notr
Spinosaurus is the largest carnivore then Giganotosaurus but despite the movie being wrong this movie was weak in all aspects Of course I expected some wokeness in the film Jeff Goldblum was the only reason I watched this Only the first two Jurassic movies were good  was ok but too short  was the shortest of the series but it was cool to see Spinosaurus  was mediocre  should have ended there   this one was trash,Notr
Ok I understand why this movie may frustrate some people I was a little bit disappointed myself but I still had a great time with this movie First thing I hear when the movie was done was Top Gun  was better Jurassic World Dominion is not Top Gun People are just mad that it wasnt as good as they thought it was going to be But you should enjoy the movie for what it is it still had great characters and great dinosaur sequences so this movie is not bad you should have a fun time at the theater,Notr
Its an absolute wowPainfully cheesy repetitive as the drumming of a woodpecker script recycled from a hundred movies before and once again over the toppish CGI How many old and new monsters can you cram in Just about as many as old and new actors to awoke that fuzzy warm feeling you had when first watching Jurassic Park three decennials agoCould I conjure up anything good here I kind of like that Malcolm character and Jeffie does him quite well but its just not near enoughIt took absolute determination to get through the whole movie without putting it on x Man Hollywood is reaching new lows by the number,Notr
What a horrid movie One of the few movies that unfortunately made it in the  billion dollar club Jurassic World was fun despite its flaws Fallen Kingdom was just kind of eh but this is an absolute disaster Its just sunk down a downward spiral that leads to hell Its bad enough to the point Im pretty convinced it was made more for money than it was for an actually good movie and thats sad I dont care for this movie or this franchise anymore the creative team leaders certainly didnt so why should I One year later and nobody talks or cares about it But sadly people will take advantage of the money they made and make some more Jurassic Park garbage Why did people flock to see it WHY Everybody Ive talked to who watched it instantly regretted buying tickets for this and not some other movie What a piece of garbage,Notr
"After reading all the negative reviews watched Jurassic world dominion without any expectationsI watched in D IMAX
I quite liked the movie not as bad as the negative reviews Definitely a one time watch",Notr
This movie spends about  of screentime building the environment and story I wouldve rather the movie be about an hour longer to actually do what I expected from it,Notr
Jurassic world dominion tries to do everything because it wants to please everyone and get all thz ticket sales in the process Since thats impossible it settles in mildly reaching all its goals and therefore I couldnt think of a possible better score than the enormously mild six out of ten And now I will further accommodate this review by words that mean absolutely nothing as to accommodate the obligatory  signs that ate mandatory by internet movies database review laws Whe I end this here sentence I might reach said mandatory signs and be able to post this here review I wish all of you a good day,Notr
This is like a movie you will enjoy if you turn off your brain for whole movie There is a lot of plotholes lots of things that is not really making any sense irl But i do like dinosaur so ill gave this a rather good review since i think of this movie better than another movie that just try to be serious but end in zonk I do like the funny iconic trex walk i find lots of scene here funny and laugh a lot because of this movie Its done its purpose of recreation The plot is so dramatic its amusing and funny I dont hate this movie but for real the dinosaurs really is not accurate If you want to enjoy turn off your brain for whole  hours lol D,Notr
Jurassic World Dominion offered a different but enjoyable twist to the usual direction taken in the franchise The impossible notion that dinosuars are something that can be introduced to everyday life is what makes the film truly unique Aswell as this it removes the thrill of seeing the dinosaurs because weve become accustomed to them after multiple movies It is difficult to keep the enthusiasm everyone held for the first film once you repeat the same formula again and again As far as Im concerned they just about pulled it off The only reason I managed to find a little enjoyment out of the movie was because I was surrounded by friends who were genuine cowards Personally I wouldnt watch again but Im glad I did with the people I did,Notr
Wow foiled again a movie from my youth gets a long awaited follow up it has a great cast with some familiar faces a big budget so theres action galore and some wonderful music but a plot a plot that could have been written by a random stranger walking past the studioHow on Earth is it possible for such a film to feel so vacuous so empty this film made me feel nothing other than boredom  that could have been used on so many other thingsIts not ok these days to simply try and dazzle us with some awesome visuals there needs to be some sort of plot but there just isnt one in simplistic terms it asks if man can live with dinosaurs but of course you know whats going to happen Some of the visuals are great epic some scenes thoughdid they run out of timeChris Pratt didnt do it for me the old cast tried but it felt hollowLike the dinosaurs themselves this franchise should have been left in the past ,Notr
Jurassic World Dominion is a step up from some of its immediate predecessors The plot consists of two stretched out intertwining arcs which separate the original cast from the more recently introduced characters The film does not fail to deliver for what its worth entertainment However its a few dinosaur steps down from the franchises legendary start,Notr
The first Jurassic Park was a classic this one is not even closeThe scriptwriting and directing were atrocious  how could they release such an unfinished product Its painful to watch now that Ive seen it all in person because there are some truly cringe worthy moments where you cant help but say wowthey really missed the markCant believe I wasted three hours of my life watching this garbage The acting was terrible the plot was nonsensical and the special effects were laughably bad is shaping up to be a pretty terrible year for movies This has got to be the worst one yet,Notr
Amazing to see the original cast back in action they nail their roles and paired well with the new leads A few decent newcomers to the cast as well However the storyline is tired  all of it been there done that from the dinosaur fights to genetics nothing new,Notr
The plot was a mix between Mission ImposibleStranger Things  two different teams teaming up at the end and some Jurassic park at the end So it was the multiverse of no plot so badly written that I wonder if I could do better with the same budgetIts sad just sad and boring,Notr
What an abomination Not a single scene that doesnt have a problem or contradiction with logical flow Hurt to watch until giving up after  mins in,Notr
Jurassic World Dominion is a film that never takes off filled with inconclusive subplots ugly dialogue uninteresting characters an unconvincing plot and a really bad montage of the film,Notr
I have no idea where to start Bad script bad acting bad direction BAD special effects original was better It was like watching an episode of Scooby Doo where they battle dinosaursbut not  hours long Justdont bother,Notr
There was good VFX beautiful scenery and they didnt compromise to show dinosaurs but the story line was not up to the mark as it lacks good content and talking about thrill in jurassic Park movies should be must but this movies lacks in that too,Notr
An absolutely appalling sequel There is no discernible plot or story line It is nice to see the original actors but I wonder why they signed up to this Why on earth was this made obviously just a money making exercise although I suspect not much money was made This should never have been made It demeans the whole franchise No More Please This movie is total barrel scraping I would not recommend anyone to watch it The acting is wooden and the scenarios are stereotyped and repetitive Thank goodness I did not spend money to see this at the cinema General verdict  dont bother  this is a waste of time,Notr
Jurassic Park is a movie that I rewatch again and again and the believability factor reigns supreme Unfortunately with this I switched off from the very beginningPros Jeff Goldbloom Sam Neill somewhat nostalgicCons So many continuity errors entomological inaccuracies scientific inaccuracies no flow chaotic story telling such a tendency nowadays to overstimulate the audience rather than captivate them poor acting,Notr
I loved this movie In my opinion it comes in nd after the original Jurassic Park Its a dinosaur movie for God sake what are people expecting I loved the return of the original cast They were in the movie more than I expected Its slow to start but once the storyline merged the two sets of characters it was fantastic I am ready to go see it again,Notr
Ill be honest here I went into this movie with low expectations this is because I read some of the reviews about how rubbish it is and how its just a cash grab But now that I have seen it I can proudly say it was a good movie and ending to a franchiseBut I will say this there is so much plot holes in this film so if your going to see it just for the plot you will come out really disappointed Its a leave your brain at the door film Just enjoy it for what it is,Notr
Its time to end the Jurassic franchise This movie is just more of the same They added giant locust in this one so theres that But really there was no reason to make this film Its the same dinosaurs The same dinosaur sounds The same running jumping climbing swimming and hiding from dinosaurs The same dramatic drawn out camera angles on the actors faces as they look either scared concerned or allknowing before scrambling to safety just in the nick of time There was no real suspense because we knew our main characters would make it home safely If the creators are insistent on making ANOTHER Jurassic film please update the formula,Notr
Dinosaur movies that are not fun great visual effects but that do not give emotions even the characters and the story of the film are not convincing An insufficient film,Notr
Jurassic World Dominion is an entertaining movie whose script is full of fanservice especially for those like me who loved the first movie its quite nice to see Sam Neill Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum together again In terms of logic the script has many flaws that are justified by the science fiction theme that the film touches on The soundtrack is good especially the theme used in suspenseful scenes The cinematography is powerful and provides some great visuals The performances are good and the director does a good job An entertaining movie but with nothing more to offer,Notr
Two and a half hours too long Worst ending to one of my favorite franchises Do not waste your time or money Zero redeeming qualities Complete garbage,Notr
No matter what peoples have said about these Jurassic World films i have enjoyed these so muchThese brought piece of my childhood backI just love dinosaursThis was great ending to trilogyThis brought back old and newI really liked how this film started with multiple storylines about different thingsAnd how they connected one by one so nicelyMore about ethics of prehistoric species in our modern worldSome really good science fiction stuffGood actionGreat visual effectsOverall well made filmBut most importantly so many different dinosaursAnd this one had so many new speciesI was impressed that im still able to recognize so many of themAnd of course there is my childhoods favorite one GiganotosaurusI really felt like i was child again while watching this filmAnd of course old faces from Jurassic Park meet new charactersThis was just greatLot of fun momentsSo entertaining,Notr
This movies plot makes zero sense people go back and forth to far off locations in no time and also dinosaurs inconceivably show up in logistically illogical places They dumbed down the OG cast and gave them barely anything to do The whole movie is just a mix of predictable jump scares mixed with Fast and the Furious like action scenes that does nothing to the plot,Notr
Absolutely loved this movie Great fun to see with your kids and felt so good to see the original cast again Lots of tongueincheek references for those of us who know the first ones by heart Now Its not perfect but then it isnt meant to be Watch it for the fun the action the magnificent dinosaurs and brilliant chemistry between the cast members Dont forget the popcorn,Notr
"Not nearly as bad as some people are making it out to be There is too much action and a lot of it is ridiculous There are too many characters and not all the performances are great The story is somehow both simple and complexBut this might is genuinely fun There are some cool dinosaurs new and old While some callbacks are a bit heavyhanded most are pretty light and enjoyable Big improvement from Fallen KingdomHeres the definitive ranking of the movies for reference
Jurassic Park
Jurassic World
Dominion
JP
Lost World
Fallen Kingdom",Notr
What an insult to Michael Crichtons original work Its sad that this is how the franchise is put out to pasture but thankfully its overIt Is Done,Notr
I just dont get it Ive just seen it and was actually reluctant to go after reading quite a bit of negativity about it BUT its actually not bad Its a solid  I was entertained the set prices were great and the old and the new cast blended well Go see it expecting to be entertained and youll have fun,Notr
We get a final gathering of all the familiar faces in this maybe final episode Its a lightweight feelgood movie that focuses on the core elements of what made Jurassic Park so great Without annoying child charactersAnd the new reality exploring the consequences of dinosaurs coexisting with humanity offers something we havent seen yet Its not as thrilling and doesnt have these inawe moments But thats OK Its still a great adventure in the Jurassic Park universe and a fine end for its legacyThe CGI was great most of the timeWith its fine balance between nostalgia and innovation its a recommendwatch for fans of the series,Notr
Its amazing to see the original cast of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World Its like a reunion adventure movie I was expecting a more in depth connection of those characters but seems it gave us a small treat or preview only given the run time they could combine more further Nevertheless it was a great movie to see especially to those Dino fans like me,Notr
Wasted  hrs No story line Forced characters Doesnt make sense Revisiting old scenes were awful CGI is too game like I remember watching the st Jurassic Park as a kid and thought the T Rex was going to jump out of the screen Overall one of the worse movie Dont waste your time and money It felt like a money grab by these movie makers exploiting a good classic movie How much more can they milk this,Notr
The first half was slow which made me slightly bored but the second half which was action packed made up for it They bring back the og trio and they along with the MCs do all they can to stop the villian from gaining total control over the food economy of the world,Notr
Ok plot wise this movie is bad and has a bit of a slow start however the action scenes are fun if not a bit Predicable but being the th movie they are out of ideas so you can enjoy the movie if you focus on the Dinos which do not disappoint In the end it could be worse,Notr
Result of Poor writing  Only thing that satisfied me was action sequence before the interval  it really gave a seat edge experience  other than that whole movie was underwhelming  Script was too weak and lame  Except few places  film majorly missed the engaging factor  First half was slow and second half was predictable and boring  hrs mins was too long  literally tested my patience  Cast done their job  Technically visuals were good  Editing was inferior  Overall  unexpectedly a disastrous end to Jurassic saga  Watch at your own risk ,Notr
New and interesting stories intertwining plots throwbacks to the past movies and books action comedy new dinosaurs to live action and the classics dinos,Notr
My review is  so I feel I can say anything I want because who on earth is going to see this oneThis was the most exhausting movie Ive watched in recent memorySo many chases  all with animals of course Dinos The first hour had so many nonstop chases that it was actually exhausting to watch Id have to stop and go do something A little bit of this a little bit of that Then back to the chase If it had a motorcycle in it it was Chris PrattThere was one scene that was very much like the bar scene in Star Wars So all the big movies now are borrowing from Star Wars If Tom Cruise in Top Gun  could do it then so could they Itll be interesting to see how many more movies copy Star WarsThat said one can only hope that if enough of us point out that we actually see their plagiarisms and call them on it maybe we can get some original movies out of Hollywood What a concept,Notr
I WISH they would have kept the show focused on Chris Pratt instead of doing equal time to all these other characters You can definitely tell Hollywood to cramming all these female actors down our throats FINE But THIS movie started Chris Pratt Im expecting to see mostly Chris Pratt Ugh Show up an hr into the movie and youll be fine It was more of a mini series crammed into hrs and it didnt work Should have kept the focus on the main character and his relationship with Blue and her baby If you have nothing else to watch and its really hot where you live right now AND you need a good nap go see it ,Notr
This is just bad enough to make me write this reviewSo bad that made me doubt if the first ever Jurassic Park was even overrated You had all the topics actors and nostalgia and you still screw this up this bad I am sorry but Colin Trevorrow really failed not just this movie but the entire franchise Money back requested,Notr
I dont know why everybody hates it I will agree the movie isnt as much about dinosaurs as it should be and its more about that girl but I still enjoyed it Its nothing special but still a good entertaining movie,Notr
I dont understand this dont they watch their own movie before release The script is bad director was worst editing tried to save some of it but no I will not watch this ever again I dont recommend it Dont waste your time or money go watch the first jurassic park again What a waste Fx are great but with that kind of money it has to be  nice moments cant save the film Why would you do this,Notr
"Id give it an 
Its got flaws of course but the film is amazing Beautiful landscapes and sceneries very good use of CGI and animatronicsOriginal even even if many didnt appreciate the new plot and ideas I did very much Its more in line with what Michael Crichton wrote in the first few pages of his novel Jurassic Park",Notr
I heard mixed opinions before going but having seen the franchise from the beginning in Was only right to go seeNot sure about the reviews of s  s but it held my attention with plenty of action and good set pieces Dinosaurs looked great and some great jumpy bits No spoilers  But Ending could of been better but overall decent watch,Notr
Jurrassic Park was a Pop Culture masterpiece Sequels will not recapture that initial magic However I found Jurassic World Dominion fun and satisfying for the most part It was great to see the union and reunion of past and present characters There were nice character arcs and cool dinosaurs and action scenes Thats all I needed Im not sure why the critics raged it so poorly Most average viewers enjoyed it Just enjoy it for what it is,Notr
Do not reminisce over the old jurassic park movies Watch it with a fresh perspective and it will be very entertaining Old and new characters and scenes are combined in this movie to make the franchise go out with a bangIgnore the other reviews It was a good movie,Notr
I have been a fan of this series since the first trailer for the original jurassic park came out So every sequel I have expected certain things or the story to explain more in the past park and characters This film delivered on some of them but opened more questions As an adult I wished the film was longer and certain things could be explained more but it felt like the studio made the director cut alot out for timing purposes to get more showing in the theatre However this is still a good movie and I am lucky to have been a child when the first one game out and now being a father watched this with my two sons They loved this movie saying it was the best They loved the Dino action they loved all the character returning and they wanted more and hoping for more jurassic films This is a Dino movie and children love them Ignore what the critics are saying and if youve got kids go and see this movie Its enjoyable and worth a watch,Notr
Another prime example of Hollywood recycling the same script over again and marketing it as a sequelImpossible to post spoilers everyone knows this storywe saw it twice beforeSame misguided greedy scientist same safe remote sanctuary same black market same heros in car in sanctuary with TRex scratching the paint Toss in a female lesbian likes redheads too black with a few rainbow patches and you got yourself a new movieEven the little bit of new scenarios added were poorly written with inconsistent timelines your mother had a genetic disorder she found out AFTER you were bornNext lines do I have this disorder No your mom altered this out of your genes so you would not suffer the same fate Wait what You just said her mom didnt know about her genetic disorder until AFTER she was born Guess mom invented a time machine as well How does blatant mistakes like this make it past editingI tell me friends to skip this one you already saw it,Notr
The people who wrote and directed this should NEVER BE ABLE TO write andor direct another movie again Colin Trevaro and his fellow writing goons are an embarrassment to hollywood and an embarrassment to cinema I normally wouldnt review a movie on here but I signed only so could leave this review its that BAD I felt like I had to I felt that passionate This movie was a worthless embarrassing piece of garbage The people who made this and the Jurassic World Series destroyed a legacy and that a beautiful one made by Steven Spielberg and his team This movie and the entire Jurassic World series need to be erased from the Jurassic canon And Colin Trevaro and the writers he works with need to be banned from making movies What a joke What an absolute joke,Notr
Incredible movie It has emotion nostalgia humour and is just a great film overall The addition of a new cast of dinosaurs combined with a much different storyline keeps things fresh but the inclusion of original cast members throwback scenes and nostalgic item inclusions gives that true Jurassic Park feeling,Notr
That scene with Chris Pratt with his hand out and Blue with its baby Thats exactly what it looked like to me Good blue roll over Im being generous giving this movie three stars out of  What was that madness What a ridiculous way to end the Jurassic Park legacy Coexisting with a planet of dinosaurs I cant imagine anyone being in a theater subjected to that mess Cocaine is alive and well amongst the writersAs I watched it all I could do was try to relate to it as a Hollywood cartoon or animated fantasy just to give myself a reason to keep watching it The level of melodrama was astounding At least in the original Jurassic Park there was an air of possibility Michael Crichtons story True wonderment,Notr
A not very funny and too long film the script does not shine and the characters neither A big wasted opportunity a mediocre short film Jurrrasic World disappointment,Notr
The only momment satisfied me was that seeing Dr Grant and Dr Ellie together again everything else just was unbearable the lazy scripting poorly written conversation overtheplace film flow lame music superhero character cliche action random  lack of coherent cut scences like you put all materials of JP  JW mix them all together and hope new movie finds a way No just same thing but different labelling number What is the good VFX for if the story does not tell the storyCould not belive they can do this to their fans Contradicting to the promise of the director this final chapter delivers nothing but disappointment and anger I respect the crew cast and all the efforts they put into making this but to me the movie is a flopWould not recommend to watch in theater Big no no,Notr
Fun movie dinos eating people little story in there action sequence were great but story felt plausible and rushed Great to see the old school introduce to new school and a few surprises thrown in not what I thought it was gonna be but not as bad as lost world just get some popcorn shut off ur mind and have fun,Notr
This movie is an outrage to the original workI mean everything that is beautiful and astonishing in the Jurassic Park concept is completely absent in this filmThey actually shot a movie that looks like it came out of the monsterverse but of poor quality taking out the dinosaurs and adding random stuff If already in the first two of the World saga the creatures have completely stopped behaving like animals but have been humanized to excess do you remember the smile of the indoraptor I remember it while I sleep here they are a simple outline to totally unrelated events The cast is simply out of control The only positive aspect that comes to mind about this socalled movie is that Crichton is no longer with us and he would not be able to witness this abomination Trevorrow had the incredible merit of making me reevaluate Star Wars episode IX,Notr
Though you thought the plot will revolve about the coexistence of Humans and Dinosaurs they failed to do thatStill love the CGI of the Dinosaurs so worth the watch,Notr
Sorry Hollywood there must have been some sort of misunderstanding hereYou had the budget you had the return of the legacy cast you had the source material two amazing novels and the original movies to draw inspiration from yet you come up with this Ive played Jurassic Park video games that have a more competent creative and entertaining story Everyone involved with the writing of this story should be embarrassed with themselves Pretty much every scene that occurred I was waiting for Vin Diesel to show up and say something about familyI think I speak for everyone when I say we dont want laser pen controlled Raptors chasing Chris Pratt around Malta on a motorbike If theres anyone out there who disagrees I hope you are happyAt this point I think this franchise needs to call it quits and thats coming from someone who has a special place in their heart for Jurassic Park and dinosaurs in generalSeriously how did the dinosaurs look better in  than they do now hahahaha,Notr
I rated Jurassic World Dominion with a seven because I like that kind of movies adventures with prehistoric animals but in all fairness the story wasnt the greatest It was much too exaggerated much too simple at times and the acting was sometimes not that great either Ive never been a big fan of Chris Pratt think hes just a mediocre actor and that didnt change with this movie And Laura Dern isnt an actress I appreciate a lot either so those two combined isnt a success formula for me The only reason I score it this high maybe too high is because of the CGIs which were very good and thats what made it entertaining Maybe its time to call it a day with the Jurassic franchise At one point enough is enough,Notr
The film is of course not innovative and is also a film where two worlds come together And to finish it off well its not going well The cast of the first three films and the last two And then a story has to be made of it And thats where it goes wrong Just like the montages The story is also not accurate in time And the dolomites is a huge area And yet the beasts can get inside in a short time In short the film has to rely on the dinosaurs locations humor scary moments and good film images The film survives that Especially the scene with the water is beautifully filmed But the bad guy isnt a bad guy and it wont work out But its like transformers Dinosaurs save the movie So it remains sufficient,Notr
I just cant believe how bad this movie is One of the lamest most pathetic banal and uninteresting movies Ive ever seen It couldnt be farther from the original Jurassic Park in any possible way The acting is quite bad everything is sooo predictable dinosaurs have almost no relevance to the plot but the worst thing is the amount of cheesy cheap good feelings the movie is packed with those murdering monsters being treated like pets What an incredible waste of money and time both theirs and mine,Notr
You know whats going to happen almost from the off But dont let this detract from the fact that this film is hugely enjoyable And brings the gang together,Notr
Banging around to all points on the globe this synthetic committeewritten mess recalls too many old characters and introduces too many new characters who take turns being nipped at by expertly created dinos at welltimed intervals As usual a rich white man is the source of all evil and characters of various ethnicities and sexual orientations save the day If it was written by a computer kudos to the programmer If it was written by humans I need to check your papers and your pulse,Notr
The only thing i really liked about the movie was the ending which had some cool scenes The movie felt empty generic and unsurprising As seen in teasers the cast of the Jurassic Park movies were introduces without a wow element so to speak the movie felt rushed even when it has quite a runtime and nothing really made sense as someone else has also reviewedScenes did not make sense the hand thing from Owen was weird and overused as if that does anything with a predator dinosaur The threat from them was also non existent I wanted to love this movie but simply could not The getting the gang back together trope could have worked allot better had they taken more time in making the plot more clearI would wait to see it until it shows on a streaming service so you dont waste your money on a film ticket,Notr
  maybe Im just a sucker for a legacy cast return a la Scream and SpiderMan No Way Home but if you can get past the rambling and frankly unnecessary first hour some bad acting from the majority of the cast Dern Wise Athie and Howard are the major exceptions and some not good and maybe even bad cinematography you will find a lot to enjoy in this sixth installment and end of a Jurassic era even with its flaws,Notr
This movie is an insult to its viewers Last time I felt like this was after watching transformers  It is just a giant mess The story is convoluted and has no meaning The supposedly scary encounters with the carnivores do not produce any atmospheric impact Woke messaging of course included as well This movie shall be remembered as part of the prime degeneracy of hollywood,Notr
I love the Jurassic Parc franchise but there has never been much of a plot except people screaming and running away from those CGI animalsThe last installment is the same formula They tried to put some disturbing plot into play but it hadnt much of a use For me its all about the suspenseaction parts and some of the scenes were all bit the same thing I have seen before I think the best action sequence was the scene in Malta Well edited and amazing camera work I loved DeWanda Wise she gave a lot of flair to her performance Absolutely loved to see the original  have a big part in the movie Laura Dern cracks me up And Bryce Dallas Howard always puts on a great scary performance Plus points for the cast for sureI absolutely enjoyed myself for h but it wont be my favourite one of the full installment Still more than recommend to watch this at the cinema,Notr
Whoever made the brilliant decision to give the keys to the Jurassic franchise to Colin Trevorrow and to let him write all three of these atrocities should be firedIts actually shocking how they are doing exactly what the original film was against Also bringing back the original cast just so the masses will go I remember that and clap like the morons they are is exactly what is wrong with Hollywood films todayThese producers Were So Preoccupied With Whether Or Not They Could They Didnt Stop To Think If They Should,Notr
This movie was a little disappointing on that the plot was really bad The visual effects sound and score are great but they barely compensate for the dumb story The previous one was better imo,Notr
Yes movie started off slow but overall a great ending to the Jurassic ParkWorld eraIve watched this series since the beginning when in high school  is near  dear to my heart especially the music I do not agree with the low reviews by criticsmovie watchers whatsoever Our audience clapped at the end of the movie  we all left very pleased,Notr
Never underestimate Hollywoods ability to take something phenomenal and cherished and suck the life out of it for money The dinosaurs felt more like window dressing than the focus Disjointed impossible to keep up with or care about the myriad of story lines Actually walked out with  minutes left because the ending is just a conclusion to a ridiculous dumpster fire,Notr
Do not trust the bad reviews Dominion is back to its roots in a fun cheesy romp with scary dinosPeople are honestly overanalyzing this its not meant to be a masterpiece it never was Most people are rating it as overthinking adults and forgetting they watched it as kids with open imaginationIts incredibly cheesy and often over acted but like most of the greats its what also makes it funthe CGI is great the dinos per minute was perfect for the kids My kids never got bored watching adults talk on screen about a story they likely didnt really care about and over explaining the science The pacing was great to keep them entertained from scene to sceneI absolutely loved the nostalgia and think it did a great job honouring the original whilst bringing the story to a closeBut advised not to watch with boring adult head on Just go in have fun and enjoy the dinosaurs and cheese,Notr
The reviews have not been kind to this movie It is better than expected and overly long and repetitive The plot is good guys get in bad situation with dinosaurs then bad guys get in same situation and get their just rewards Repeat Repeat RepeatThis movie is simply too long It throws in characters from the first three Jurrassic Park films from the s puts them in dangerous situations which they luckily sometimes cleverly escape Luck never runs out for our heroes but the bad guys eventually shoot crapsIt would be much better if twenty to thirty minutes were cut Perhaps if one of the protagonists actually didnt escape every time,Notr
Im not sure what they were trying to achieve with this movie but Im guessing this wasnt itPoor writing direction acting cinematographyPredictable phoned in cornycringe lines and trying to revisit the original and failing on all accounts,Notr

The concept and premis for the could have been improved but did a good job of uniting lead characters from the early and later franchised moviesThe Kayla Watts character was poorly represented by the actor Dewanda Wise not a reflection on her acting ability but the castingThe many references to earlier movies and the evolution of Henry Wu was enjoyableNot perfect but a satisfactory end to the franchiseIf I had to rate the franchise in order of personal appreciation I would place it at no ,Notr

I went into this film with high expectations and they were barely met which is okay This didnt feel like a Jurassic film It felt like a Mission Impossible movie with dinosaurs Theres some call backs to Kenner artwork which felt like a nice touch Jeff Goldblum in my opinion carried this film His character felt the most important You should never go into this film expecting an Oscar winning script These films have never made sense so when you apply realism to this franchise resort it to the dinosaurs I loved the animatronics which made it feel like the first film allot Dont listen to critics and go see this movie If you love dinosaurs and you turn your brain off youll have a great time with friends,Notr
Jurassic world dominion is the best movie of the Jurassic park franchise and I hate the it has a bad rating it doesnt deserve a bad rating And if you havent seen it go watch it now,Notr
To paraphrase the great Dr Ian Malcolm they were so concerned with whether they could make five Jurassic Park sequels that they didnt think about whether they should make five Jurassic Park sequels What a piece of junk the latest one is Its plodding and predictable It offers nothing new just supposed homages and Easter eggs Thankfully I have Regal Unlimited Two hours and twenty six minutes long and it felt like four hours Sam Neill doesnt seem to realize hes supposed to be playing the same character that he did in the original Chris Pratt is more annoying by the second I sincerely hope that his MCU role is almost at an end Didnt Bryce Dallas Howard have a promising career at one point And she and Laura Derns Ellie Sadler are total badasses Until they have to walk over some bugsthen the shrieking begins What crap What tripe What an utter waste of time,Notr
This was a hard watch Im a big fan of this franchise The only entertaining parts are about the last  minutes or so The action is sub par even then Save your money and watch it at home,Notr
What a disaster movie The story is so shallow predictable with unbelievable actions With such a good cast you should make a diamond not this awfulness Disastrous visual effects Im really disappointed as a big fan of Jurassic Park movies,Notr
I felt Dominion was a bit of a Mish mash of Jurassic Park and Jurassic world We had similarities to both trilogies but not too much that was new and that we had not seen before Even the ending was similar to Jurassic World  I felt like the editing was a bit choppy and it all felt a bit rushed Ive heard a directors cut is coming out so I do hope it will tidy up the film It was fun and great to see a mix of the original and sequel casts coming together I look forward to seeing it again when released on blu rayiTunes There were alot of special dinosaur scenes which I loved but the fact that the films story stretched too so many areas I think this spoilt the narrative a bit and brought you out of the journey from time to time I cant wait for the release to own and look forward to the directors cut,Notr
I feel that this final film in the saga goes back to the roots of the original Jurassic park It focuses on overreach of the power with technologymainly biotechnology It was a good way to bring the new cast and original together in a way that felt believable Also added a couple of great new characters The realistic true form dinosaurs were quite neat and the touch of nostalgia here and there was great,Notr
It seems like theyre running out of ideas to make new movies in the franchiseThe movie itself is a good entertainer with very well directed thrill sequences like the chases and human interactions with the mighty predators In that sense it a very good watchWhat one may be disappointed with is the story line as there is hardly anything novel to offer They tried to cash in the following of Sam Neill and Laura Dern but that doesnt help beyond a pointI would still recommend it to watch for the execution brilliance of whatever they had on their plate,Notr
A Jurassic Park and Jurassic World mish mash I could go on and on but Im tired after struggling through the movie Using the same old ideas putting the same old actors with some new ones and adding lots of computer graphics does not mean its will be a good movie Bigger dinosaurs with more noise is just BORING I couldnt wait for the movie to end The scariest part of the movie is that it is doing well at the boxoffice so there will probably be another bad sequel Jurassic Universe  or Multiverse Please think it through or just let it die,Notr
Lots of dinosaurs action and explosions It felt like quite a long couple of hours I thought is was an OK movie and contained all the Jurassic sequel elements youd expect but that was about it I feel pretty bad leaving this as a review considering there was obviously no expense spared in the making of this film and the cast that was put together to bring it to the big screen But in short it was just OK not one Ill be looking out for when it if released onto streaming channels,Notr
Everything is said in the title What a disappointment of a film A mess from start to finish It was good to see the return of Sam neill Jeff goldblum and Laura Dern but its not interesting at all I though they could not do any worst than Jurassic World But this is far worse,Notr
Well the movie is pretty predictable no surprises We now know however holding out your right hand will prevent all dinosaurs large or small from eating you Its the power of the hand,Notr
Watch this movie and watch the original classic Jurassic Park The contrast is staggering on how stupid and Hollywood these movies have become It feels like they are trying to capture the same stupidity of the Fast  the Furious franchises latest entries The movie has high production value and decent acting but like many Hollywood turds the script is just unbelievably stupid I absolutely hated Fallen Kingdom for that very reason and this movie is no different Watch the movie to see how stupid it is for yourself if you dont believe me,Notr
I question those trying to find the meaning of life and Academy Award performances from a dinosaur movie I found the movie quite entertaining and true to the original Jurassic Park concept The movie lines up with the old Saturday afternoon thrillers monster movies and science fiction epics The movie is fun That is all one really needs to know,Notr
How on earth this damp effort is taking as much as x as much as Maverick is beyond me I am speechless Revisited way too often to make a credible impact Overlong and time to call it quits,Notr
Look I know the plot of this movie is all over the place but tbh I really liked and enjoyed it Jurassic Park was my childhood Ive watched it so many times and seeing the OG Cast finally back on the big screen made me soo happy Also Im a huge DinoNerd so Im maybe a little bit biasedI really liked that some lesser known or non mainstream dinos got the spotlight The chemistry between the old and new cast worked great There are many shotsscenes which are really cinematic and look absolutely gorgeousOverall storyplot is okay but messy great cast and chemistry cool dinosaurs that usually dont get enough spotlight some really cool looking scenes which I would love to have as a wallpaper and lots of fanservice and callbacks to the old movies,Notr
Well I am not surprised by the output of this movie as I did not expect much from it in the first placeThis movie follows the same routine of Jurassic World  and Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom  popcorn movies and nothing moreOut of the  Jurassic Park and Jurassic World movies the very first Jurassic Park movie  was the most exciting and valuable one to watch,Notr
I dont know where to start but everything about this movie is actually bad All the dialogs are out of place Its full of forced quotes from the previous movies All the performances are very very awful even the original cast acted so bad and were talking about people like Laura Dern Sam Neil and Jeff Goldblum The plot its so dumb and occasionally nosense Also photography directing visual effects and editing are very low tier if we think about the franchise and the budget,Notr
You would think that Jurassic World Dominion learn the lessons from Disney Star Wars Just because you bring back the original Jurassic Park characters they thought they can bring back and it would be successful but not Poor Laura Dern history repeats itself again,Notr
Having grown up in the s Jurassic Park was a big part of my life I have enjoyed the movies for years This newest movie is fantastic I loved it as did the five other people I went with It was fun to see all the separate stories come together and seeing old favorites was exciting It was all really well doneacting effects music writing the action the humor If you cant enjoy a movie like this then you want too muchGone are the days when people can just go to a movie and enjoy it as it is and not expect it to change their entire life Movies are meant to be enjoyed they are meant to take you away for a short time When did it stop being like that If you want to be shocked and scared and changedwatch the freakin news,Notr

Bad acting or directing Maybe too small a sound stage with too much green screen Everybody always seemed to be standing so close to each other I dunno it felt lowbudget and maybe even lazy because they didnt seem to be trying to being anything new to the table Just resting on their laurels to bring in the viewsAnyway I didnt feel the nostalgia for the first movie like I think I was supposed to I used the fastforward button a lot  which I never do the first time I watch a film  and I just couldnt find myself in it like I did in most of the othersIts too bad too because I would really have liked to feel that nostalgia and I really wanted to suspend my disbeliefThis is a rare review from me Im actually sorry that I felt I needed to write it,Notr

We watched it and enjoyed it It is a sixth installment Those are usually terrible and enjoyed mostly by people who enjoy repetitiveness We didnt get that vibe here It felt like closing the circle with the iconic first movie Perhaps people keep expecting another experience like in  but thats impossible because that was the only time we were able to be vowed by a very first seemingly realistic look at dinosaurs It was mind blowing But that can never be recreatedOf course this installment has no unexpected plot If it did THAT would actually kill the vibe This movie is based on nostalgia on the joy of getting the old trio of Laura Dern Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum back together and them meeting the Jurassic World leadsWe were very pleasantly surprised and liked  better than  and  Or even  and  They did fine with this,Notr
The potenial was there but this movie didnt make any sense poor plot wooden characters no depth Left the cinema wondering what I just watched Doesnt even have good dinosaur battles Poor film Please save your money and go to top gun maverick if you want to see a good movie this summer,Notr
It was a great way to end the series It was great seeing all the original characters back from the first movie in  So long ago I give them credit for showing how mankind lives with dinosaurs now instead of the usual dinosaurs escaping from captivity and they have to out run them There were a few points in the movie where the dialogue seemed choppy however there was plenty of action and plenty of dinosaurs and I thought the actors were terrific I saw Top Gun Maverick a few weeks ago which is a repeat from an older movie and I thought they did a better job on that one however Jurassic World is still very good,Notr
One of worst written and directed big budget movies Ive seen in a long time Made Transformers look like Seventh SealIt starts with the  minutes of narration at the beginning to try to make the rest of it make any kind of sense This fails Then there are the other obvious reshot or dubbed lines to try to make things make sense These also failForget the black ops CIA agents easily defeating humans armed with machine guns then throwing their guns down and turning their backs when confronted with some dinosaurs trained to literally run up and bite them Forget that the controls for the mainframe that needs to be turned off is in the same room where they kept the experimental grasshoppers and which had been soaked in lighter fluid and set on fire earlier Forget that restarting the mainframe also brought the grasshoppers who were burned to a crisp hours earlier back to life Forget all that and answer this Did Kayla steal that airplane from Baloo from TailSpin Its obviously the same plane did she pay for it Do talking bear pilots exist in the Jurassic Park universe,Notr
I am a huge Jurassic Park fan and the st movie was and always will be one of my favorite movies that Ive ever seen in theatersAll these new dinosaur species but not enough present on screenWhenever action starts it goes by so quicklyI think Jurassic World movies should be more about dinosaurs not about human characters and their relationshipsLooks like Hollywood is determined to ruin every single s and s cult movie,Notr
This movie relies on fan service by bringing back the old characters from Jurassic park but they forget to write a story They should of killed off some of the characters in this movie cause any one who is about to die get eaten by a dinosaur another character will arrive just in time to save them I mean come on this is final movie why didnt they kill off anyone the only characters that die is the villain and random background characters Owens daughter  I dont remember her name nor do I care just says something sassy and has zero character even though she is the plot of this movie The actress also does a bad accent through out the film and its just so annoying,Notr
Plenty of action some impressive sequences and fun unlike JP Fallen Kingdom which was just miserable If youre expecting high art when has JP ever been that youll be disappointed but if youve plenty of popcorn and are out for an evening without having to think too much its good value entertainment,Notr
Why JW Dominion is The worst JW ever The script is extremely weak Bring back the old character only for money Its so predicatablethere is moreThe only thing they care is add Lgbt character in storyi dont have problem with them but in every movie i recently watched they added by force even at the cost of destroying the story,Notr
Top Gun sequel took  or  steps up compared to the first while Dominion took  or  steps down There were a lot of action scenes that were OK to watch and some were actual fun to The problem is the story did not at all have the suspense of the first one It never drew you into the plot it just became too preachy Sad since it could have been good but it wasnt,Notr
Lots of meaningless action Same old boring predictable near death experiences Feels like it was written so badly to make sure its the last one Script older than the dinosaurs Relying on the mix of actors to get bums on seats Id recommend not bothering to be one of them bums on seats,Notr
Theres a few low scores on this film but overall I enjoyed itYes I agree the story line isnt the best in the world but what do you expect its going to be about dinosaurs people being bad and people being nibbled a bit its what all the other films where aboutPerhaps  is a little high but Ill stick with it  I enjoyed the film If you liked the other ones the chances are youll like this one,Notr
"Imagine the fast and furious franchise made a bgrade straight to dvd attempt at a remake of the original It has the same cast and crew but theyre all washed up sad and lonely and then blatantly scripted the same lines and scenes as the first film But they dont care anymore its been done to death and even the script writers busy going to parties getting high and smashing French champagne Theyre all done with Torettos over the franchise over worked and legitimately now only in it for the money
Its like that but with dinosaurs",Notr
Lets just hit the important stuff first As far as the action goes its a Jurassic Park movie Of course the action is going to be a lot of fun Some fun some intense and creative dinosaur action happened and it was engaging With that saidThe story had potential It was handled very poorly I wished that they made me truly care about these characters particularly Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard but the character arcs were weak sadly Instead of developing interesting character arcs that got replaced with the nostalgia factor which for the record Sam Neil Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum still got itAnd honestly the film itself couldve been shorter It did feel like it dragged on unfortunately There were also some character decisions that kind of made scratch my head and was like huh The music was forgettable unfortunately Theres a lot of flaws to this film that I could list But there is still some fun that could be found in this One watch is enoughC,Notr
There is never any really any sense of danger and the plot if you can call it that just quietly plays out One of the few movies I wish was shorterNot even the dinosaurs were as good as in the earlier installmentsIn the end its a sad waste of talented actors who combined with a little bit of nostalgia provide just enough to call it a movie,Notr
This movie took awhile to get going They were doing so much building of the plot it felt like it was never gonna start Once it got going and this dinosaur movie had some good dinosaur action it was pretty enjoyableIt is a long line of pretty good movies that Im glad we are getting but thats all they are pretty good not great,Notr
The reunion of characters and iconic scenes can warm the heart of any Jurassic Park fan however outside of those moments the story fails to stand on its own It seems the direction of the film is often sidetracked by implementing these nostalgic moments even some iconic dinosaurs were merely reduced to memories of better scenes in the past,Notr
Love how they took from the first movie and honored it by adding little Easter eggs The cast was amazing and it wasnt drawn out the plot was to the point One of my favorite out of the entire series,Notr
Sure it was not the best of the JP movies Jurassic Park and Jurassic World were my favorites But it certainly was not as bad as some of the other reviews stated And it was better than some of the other sequels they have been churning outMy husband and I thought the movie was pretty good my husband often falls asleep during the bad ones and I really enjoyed seeing all the characters from the JP movies come together even if it was near the end I thought that the movie would have been better if it were edited down to  hours it was a bit long I was looking at my watch near the end of the movie and cutting it back would have made the plot tighter and the movie more interesting,Notr
Jurassic Park meets James Bond No story and pretty ordinary action sequences What happened to this franchise The original cast meets the new cast a mish mash of cliches and new cgi that just doesnt work Watching movie reminded of a theme park ride rather a movie Should stop at  maybe even  Hollywood keep churning out this garbage,Notr
I didnt like this movie as much as the previous ones Pratt who is supposed to be the main guy doesnt get as much air time as other boring characters Claires facial expressions were very good It was good to see some old characters but I kept wanting to see Pratt more And I hate all this girl is the key to everything crap The black actress was an interesting character The chase scenes were the only really enjoyable parts But unfortunately once again the character writing is bad as with other Hollywood movies But at least it wasnt as woke as other movies,Notr
This is the perfect film for DX Full of nostalgia too Any Jurassic fan can enjoy this installment if you just go with an open mind and not nitpicking the script,Notr
Jurassic park was a masterpiece of a film and these new films have slowly killed its reputation Even the cgi is worse Creativity in films as died in recent years and this film proves it The old cast should of been embarrassed to sign up,Notr

If you liked the Jurassic Worlds  and loved Jurassic Park  youll have loads of things to like in this movie too But Im biased the movie has dinosaurs was filmed partly in Malta while I lived there we had news of the movie every day haha AND in my favourite place on earth the Dolomites,Notr
This movie is amazingly bad A series of scenes which dont seem to have a real connection but angry dinosaurs being involved It seems like seeing the same sequence multiple times once in a city a forest a frozen lake but its basically all the same What really baffles me is the complete lack of character development Basically every character remains flat and ends up where he has been before This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time,Notr
I went into this th instalment of the Jurassic saga with a lot of trepidation All the negative reviews had me lower my expectationsAnd you know what Its not as awful as everyone made it out to beNot as good as the original trilogy nor the th entry Jurassic World But its definitely miles better than Forbidden KingdomHaving the original trio of Neill Dern and Goldblum reprising their classic roles did bring more nostalgia than I anticipated Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard the heros of the new trilogy were definitely pushed into the backseat for this new filmBut it was fun popcorn entertainment with some stunning visuals and action packed set pieces laced with tensionSure the whole locust subplot felt out of place and stupid but it didnt impact my enjoyment one bitIts a fine addition to the franchise Maybe not the send off we wanted but not awful either,Notr
I rarely blame the writer for a bad movie as more than often its the result of a studio or producers ego  but the writing was objectively poorThe industry has been so hot on Carmichael for awhile and honestly it seems like she had never even watched Jurassic Park or read Crichtons books It felt more like Fast  Furious plus dinosaurs with sappy dialogue and nonsensical plot points one after another And even though we have an army of characters that barely got any development the story insisted on introducing more which were boring additionsClearly this story also was pushing some agendas and its painful philosophical discussions make the OG movie sound like Socrates and Plato compared to this rubbishJust look at the ridiculous outfits Emily Carmichael wears to premieres and tell me this person should be writing the Jurassic Park franchiseIf youre going to make another Jurassic Park film get a writer who lives and breathes this franchise who knows the book by heart and is bursting with creativity  not the hot writer agents tell you to work with,Notr
You know what The nostalgia sorta works here for me Its endearing to see the old cast again some iconic scenes recreations now with a sort of poke at the generational gap I dig it It brought me back a piece of my childhood and a movie aint good unless it can connect you to something I dont watch Jurassic Park for perfect plot lines or complexities I do it for the majestic Dino recreation This one just worksThere are also some very uniquely terrifying situations and Ive seen every which genre of thrillerhorror so that was kinda nice The actors were all playing their character really well and they all seems to genuinely like working with each otherOverall I liked everything,Notr
I was fan of Jurassic world part  and  So I expected more from part  And seriously after seeing the disaster part  it will be shame to call me as a Jurassic fan They dont apply any good story just made it for money But u lost our love and respect,Notr
If they had focused more on how awesome it would of looked day to day for Dinosaurs and animals and humans coexisted after the previous films It could have been jaw droppingSo many characters the dinosaurs were more like extrasThis is the first film I had no jumps or felt zero tensionThank god we finally saw the DimetrodonI just wish after films the plesiosaur got some screen timeSad it was in production this long and we got an action film not a dinosaur film,Notr
All this movie has to offer is cliches and boring plots Not much of interest happens and all of it feels like the movie needed to check a couple of Jurassic worldpark movie boxes and then they were finished,Notr
Not sure why this has such a low score Its full of action dinosaurs and nostalgic cheese Just sit back and enjoy IMDB is going to get ruined by ridiculous scores There is no way this deserves so many low ratings If you dont like it fine Lets add some s for production acting sound effects and entertainment value,Notr
I enjoyed it But Just enjoyed The best part of the movie was the return of the original cast Jeff Goldblum of course was phenomenal and fell right back into the role of Ian Malcolm We gotta all be honest here though the first two movies of JP were amazing because they were done by Spielberg and based on the books Everything after just feels like a cheap rip off,Notr
Im just at the intro and Im laughing so hard Considering these are dangerous creatures They are not like bears or lions These are bigger faster and eat much more the goverments would surely contain them and just make another jurassic world island to contain them all rather than making them live freely in the cityHow many people would get eaten  pets tooIm surprised they only have  deaths in the past year too That number would surely be up considering how dangerous the ocean would be  flying as wellThis is like some fanfiction story that bend reality and logic and much worst The rest of the story doesnt help much,Notr
Its exactly what the movie should be It calls back to the first three it reminds you of the excitement of the first one it brings everyone together and ties the story up I really enjoyed it,Notr
Plot is decent No real need to develop new characters It is fun fast paced and not so gory It was a good way to wrap things up It was better then the second one of this Trilogy,Notr
Id heard it was badbut Ive been a die hard fan of Jurassic Park since I saw it at the cinema on my th birthday All I can say is that I really do hope that this film franchise is now dead and extinct forever because it was TERRIBLEThe characters I didnt care about Dodgson even less It was nice to see the three original characters back together but the story and bad writing overshadowed all of this The story was so long winded and boring that I nearly turned it off midway I only finished it and that was incredibly difficult because I felt I owed it to Jurassic park to finish the final installmentInstantly forgettable forever regrettable You will be wasting your time watching thisits all been done and been seen in the previous five movies Shame but like most things its had its day and unfortunately it was on my th birthday,Notr
The first Jurassic Park was a thoughtprovoking science fiction film with enormous entertainment valueBut after the first film pseudoscientific realism was thrown in the trash can emphasis was placed just on the popcorn factor making these movies falling into the spectrum of a good visual festival with a mediocre narrativeThis film is perhaps the one that takes this principle further The story is generic it serves as a pretext to go from action scene to action scene with dinosaurs explosions bar fights impossible pursuits with vehicles on land and in the airHowever it still has some wellcrafted nostalgia factor I really enjoyed seeing Sam Neill Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum together once again And to the films credit these characters are more than glorified appearances taking up quite a bit of space in the filmConclusion Its a brainless action movie with plenty of nostalgia good character moments and a corny bplot narrative that is very bland and shallowI enjoyed this movie more than the previous one If you dont expect much from it it might be fun,Notr
That gives it a leg up over other franchisesOtherwise its bloated confusing and unearned Disappointing ending to this franchise Hope to see more,Notr
So amazing CGI dinosaurs is old stuff now Been there done that World Dominion is going for the nostalgic play by bringing back the original cast of the  Jurassic Park That was cool but somehow even with the original stars the old magic could not be restored The Francise has run its course and the way they left it does not sit right with me Dinosaurs have a right to live alongside us That seems terrifying and not a happy way to leave things I still give this movie a  due to exciting action scenes I often found I was tensing in suspense from the action And that is really what you come to expect from these movies good dinosaur action,Notr
Another case of a film better left unmade just designed to suck money out of people Actors were great story was just a rehash of everything before,Notr
Wow is anyone really surprised that review bombing is becoming the new past time for people who have nothing better to do This movie rules Please do not listen to all these negative reviews This is easily one of the best films in the franchise,Notr
Due to this film being one of the first films being filmed in lockdown it really wasnt that bad I felt the dialogue was a bit messy especially when Alan Grant and Ellie are speaking with the antagonist at the beginning However there were some good scenes but again like most films it was in the trailer Apart from that the detail on the dinosaurs is astonishing and where there is action there really isnt anything wrong with itSlow beginning and an alright ending I would recommend watching it though,Notr
Dont care what the critics said the film is fine with the cast from original JP wat else can u demand moreThe franchise is too expensive to end there will be more in future and tat time I will bring my kids to watch to continue the legacyThe sad thing about this film is the soundtrack Welcome to Jurassic World doesnt played much in this finale it is a very powerful touching and touching music,Notr
Is it great No Can you be entertained while watching it Absolutely Know what you are going into  this is no where near the caliber of the first one or any blockbuster hit for that matter but if you go in with the mindset that This will not be good you will enjoy yourself,Notr
No resemblance to anything related to the franchise Please disregard this mess and hopefully they will make another actual Jurassic park movie to finish the series No excuse for this crap,Notr
The film was really a last Goodbye saying thingNice to watch well done digital perfection nice entertainment but easy to forget againBut I do not regret that I watched the last film of this kindBut do not forget  we are the Dinos now,Notr
Worth checking out Great closure to the series Dont listen to the critics just go and have a great time Loved that the old cast came back to join the new cast Well done everyone,Notr
Terrible acting Horrendous and ridiculous story and hardly any dinosaursEvil Tim Cooks acting was so terrible it was laughableTotal mess of a final movie Skip this one,Notr
This is less about the warnings of man playing god and our creation tuning on us and more that man is just awful and really bad because we are breathing and exist rather than correct the mistake lets conserve them and complain about us and the resolve is surprising giving the original premise,Notr
I love the Jurassic Park franchise and this had good moments but the story was a bit flat The original characters were great to see together again and their little personal moments were fantastic but the dinosaurs were almost secondary It was almost like it was about the young girlThe original Jurassic Park had science fiction but it was really believable and the story was fantastic with great characters too The first Jurassic World recaptured this and stretched out the reality but that was fine but the story in this one wasnt the bestI think it is time to leave this franchise now and let it go down as one of the best in the last  years,Notr
TERRORble My new word just for this movies It really encompasses all aspects including acting directing music and plotLike anything in an inflationary environment you get poor value for bloated costly actors and the Hollywood industry Go see Mavericka properly done sequel,Notr
Lots of cgi as usual with creatures chasing people as usual but they seem to have spent more time focusing on the female action girl quota than they did on any story Oh the acting is poor and unconvincing too Just watch some David Attenborough stuff instead,Notr
This plot was so god awful and was bad to watch throughout this film Im very disappointed in this movie as I expected huge things and really looked forward to it but my expectations were shot down and I didnt really enjoy this at times There was some good moments at times but overall I didnt really like this one,Notr
Bad writing full of cliches some scenes are just plain stupid The expectation from title or trailer is that this is a postapocaliptic movie set Jurassic Park universe but in reality this is bad spy movie with dinosaurs as motorcycles and rogue agents This is a perfect example of how you could ruin a beloved and nostalgic universe If it was up to me writers and producers of this movie would never get another job in film industry Disgrace All of the stars in the movie cant do anything cant save it There is lack of logic in every event that happens in the movieLike one in the beginning the girl gets scared of the raptor outside the house literally  minutes after she grabs her bike and goes to rideAlso world where dinosaurs and human are roaming the earth is too calm Seems like this movie was made by radical creationists who teach kids that Noah had dinosaurs on his arc,Notr
I dont agree with people who nitpick The movie delivered everything you want in a movie Its entertaining exciting and contrary to many movies today actually has an ending We left the theater happy to have spent the time watching this Highly recommend and I dont say that lightly,Notr
Some of these reviews I cant seem to fathom or understand I just watch the movie and I seemed to have enjoyed it I wasnt expecting it as most were I was surprised with how the director and writers of the movie were gathering most of the past Jurassic park characters together That was fun to watch However what I was disinterested about was the fact that the movie took nearly an hour to build up its action which was half of its timing However that wasnt much of a bug for me Nonetheless it was a fun ride and overall it was a decent movie Dont listen to some of these reviews You enjoy it,Notr
Jurassic World Dominion is a film with ugly dialogue and a really bad montage of the film I didnt like the story neither is the management of the characters Disappointing,Notr
Looking at how zestfully it demonstrates a broad variety of dinosaurs draws forthright references to some famous scenes from the erstwhile features and also the fact that they bring the original cast back speaks a lot about their intentions thus I can safely tell that more than anything Jurassic World Dominion is a movie strictly made for the fans and fans only Since this was presumed to mark the denouement of this decadelong franchise this was rather an obvious decision from their end to bank upon the element of nostalgia for one last timeNot that Im complaining though as a fan of Jurassic Park and these wondrous critters in general I couldnt have asked for more to be honest Yet my biggest complaint is that amid all this flashiness and showboating the makers for whatever reason forgot to look after the core storyline The plot is quite unstable it is indeed inconsistent and is certainly plagued with an awful lot of expositions and pointless maneuvers Most importantly it doesnt seem to provide any of the thrill or the suspense a film of this stature requires or rather insists upon,Notr
While some of the reviews are fight about plot holes and what not this is a Dinosaur movie We dont need Oscar worthy performances or solid story linesWe all have a child within us that wakes from sleep when we see or hear anything about dinosaurs,Notr
I was so excited to see this movie and it was so so disappointing CGI was like a low budget indie for Netflix Acting was the same You could have gone out and gotten better performances from a high school productionThe screenwriters should be banned from ever being allowed to write anything ever again EverNo story terrible acting terrible special effects Only redeeming quality was some amazing stuntsWhat a disappointing end to such a great franchise,Notr
Feels like a school team project where everyone did their part at home and then the team leader assembled the pieces one hour before the deadline there was just too much people too little dinosaurs and lots of unfinished stories a very sad way to end a sagathe only fun part were the callbacks to the original movieFirst time reviewing a movie ,Notr
Overall it was decent and I enjoyed the old cast meeting the new But it felt very underwhelming with the plot and action I think more time was spent trying to do all the storylines rather than more creativeness and action,Notr
Love the content and the graphics of the movie this one has a whole different experience compared to the other Jurassic World moviesmovie was so utterly predictable it was a little painful Luckily the nostalgia nods were sprinkled throughout and mostly not forced You can tell they tried to have some funny oneliners which fell flat a lot of the time They need to take some notes from Marvel on those The CGI and action was as good as youd expect and offered favorable intensity The story itself was somewhat lazy IMO Did I mention it was totally predictable,Notr
I really enjoyed this movie I went to see it with my cousins a couple days ago and I liked itHowever its just too predictable I always knew what was gonna happen a minute before it actually did taking away the charm that this movie was supposed to have,Notr
Grasshopper thats all I have to sayIt tells me the review needs to be  characters so Id say this is the th to th best Jurassic movie there is If you want to watch a movie about dinosaurs this isnt the one,Notr
Too much of everything Too much political drama too many dinosours everywhere too many characters that you are supposed to care about but you dont It would have been better to kill a few of them off early on to add some tensionBecause the dinosours are everywhere it has a numbing effect and you dont even care when they appearThe kid is super annoying The only positive thing about the movie is all the beloved characters from earlier movies including Dr Grant and Ellie although neither can save the movie I wish the movie had just mainly focused on these two and Ian it would have been enough and added nostalgiaThis was by far the worst of the franchise I would say All the other movies were at least OK Ive even seen all of them at least once in spite of serious flaws,Notr
They try so hard to make it more exciting complex and fun But sorry its confusing To put old cast with the new ones is a good idea but the story is not strong enough to make me believe that they belong together Its just weak,Notr
Lots of suspense beginning to end Funny parts too Came in with low expectations because of the reviews and was pleasantly surprised Will definitely watch this one a lot with the fam,Notr
Who green lit this crap This is not the Jurassic ParkWorld we all know and love This is some CIA operative action flick with underground dinosaur markets and new terrible characters that make no sense Yes they bring back the old characters but they are used in a completely different type of side story The bad guys are an added part that just take over the story So this movie is less about dinosaurs and more about bad people trying to take over the world Nothing saves this movie I am so glad we watched this when it was free cause its absolutely terrible Dont waste your time Just to reach the max words needed again its terrible,Notr
It seems they are trying to see how long they can keep this story going The story line was OK bringing all the past and present together seemed to struggle to find its cohesion throughout the movie at times it felt to be two different movies with the old cast and new cast in the same studio on different sets with no barrier Its hard to rate visual effects anymore with technology what it is everyone has almost the same skill set so you have to come back to the story and the actors telling it I give it a  only because of the Jurassic franchise as Ive always been a fan Just feels like they could have done better,Notr
If you were asked to guess the plot of this movie by watching the last  minutes off Fallen Kingdom you would stand no chanceI thought we would spend the film with dinosaurs running riot on earth Ruining towns attempts at domesticating things like that But no Instead we get like a spy movieIs it nice to see the old characters Sure but because there are two groups on two completely separate missions it can feel lob sided and underdeveloped Crisp Rat and BDH literally spend the whole movie journeying to their destination That is there plot Take planearrive at climax They may as well have not been thereAlso the CGI just looked bad It looks like cartoons Like Dinosaur King Just look at the first Jurassic Park movie the dinosaurs look so good they feel real but I never felt like were are real here,Notr
I will say this movie doesnt fail to keep you entertained with the entry of so many new dinosaur species I would say that this movie is still pretty good apart from having a few corny bits sprinkled in,Notr
We enjoyed all the other Jurassic park and world movies this one was not the same standard at all So drawn out two stories in one bringing back the original characters Kids were bored people were leaving the cinema wouldnt recommend,Notr
As someone who has read Crichtons books darn near all of them still havent read Airframe this movie was all the things Wrap it up full circle deep commentary on the scientific power we wield as humans with both miraculous and disastrous consequences This is not a crowdpleasing no need to think monsteraction movie Which is something Michael Crichtons original novel was never meant to be At long last the second franchise finally got back to the roots of what the books were really about And I loved every second of it,Notr
Its absolutely unwatchable Scenes alter with no logical storyline original characters are introduced like in a s sitcom its a new era of Jurassic World where we all live together and it just does not make any sense It feels like something made this movie and it wasnt a human being Like a deep fakeIt is worst than the first Jurassic World film and that one was pretty bad Pratt is below average in bothId rather rewatch Spielbergs original masterpiece or reread the book Or just sit and stare at the wall,Notr
This is my least favorite of all the Jurassic park movies There are some scenes i could say are great but thats all only some scenes I thought because it was last one they could it did something amazing like other franchises but I was so wrong,Notr
The best thing I can really say about this movie is that isnt as bad as the previous one Its just a passable action flick with a pretty weak story and an uneven pace,Notr
This must be one of the most stupidly misconceived big budget films Ive ever seen A storyline that actively resists your interest even though you know that there will be dinosaurs Direction so incapable it feels like it was mixed live like some kind of dinosaur concert No doubt there were countless talented creatives involved in this megaproduction its just unfortunate none of them were at the very top,Notr
This is high budget movies so I expected more from this movies Quite disappointed This story is predictable and not suspense much like previous sequel However still good acting and props Maybe scriptwriting need to improve storyline so not so clich,Notr
This is one of the worst dinosaur related movies ever This movie is like bland mashed potatoes and analy destructive spicy food at the same time It feels like they made this movie for brain dead people and they filmed this only on Monday mornings when all the people involved had a hangover,Notr
Boy is it a confused film Not because of the storyline but because it is genuinely all over the placeThere is good the original and new teams in the same film A different premise which sort of makes sense Some heart stopping action sequences with caveats Certainly not boringThe negatives Even more preposterous than it should be Yes it obviously IS preposterous but some of the occurrences are laughable Some of the action is painful Claire doing Jason Bourne over the rooftops Oh well no high heels Some great CGI some not so much Tbh the ORIGINAL cgi was more believablePerhaps just too much all in all  May be generous but the excitement just about makes it worthwhile The original Spielberg is still by far the best by a big margin,Notr
I mean I get how cool dinosaurs in a car chase in a city sounded but it just didnt work There were a lot of places where I could tell the director thought I would be overjoyed with nostalgia but nothing felt earned I thought Chris Pratt barely got the raptors he trained for years to stop with his magic had motion but suddenly it works in every dinosaur on planet earthThe story was so weak Im surprised anyone thought it was worth making Oh wait no Im not it seems like executives heard nostalgia and thought nostalgia equals money and we love money Well I like good stories Too bad you didnt try for that,Notr
Epic finale for the Jurassic Park franchise Everyone has their opportunity to shine in this romp of a movie Couple characters from the last movie fell by the wayside which is understandable given the triumphant return of the original cast Viceral action sequences The cgi was great Loved the scale of this movie as everything comes full circle I really enjoyed it,Notr
Pros The second half of the film was really fun The OG cast was awesome The effects were goodCons The current cast got progressively worse as the film progressed The first half of the film was mainly nonsense and really dragged by The conclusion was honestly lame for a trilogy finaleAlso The Dilophosaurus still horrifies me like Im rewatching the original Jurassic ParkIve seen worse but definitely have seen better,Notr
The Jurassic Park movies used to be about cracking boundaries whether that was by scientifically bringing back dinosaurs or showing us that we can enjoy a movie about monsters eating people whilst still feeling small and real and have that out of worldly feeling Im afraid in this instalment the only new ground being struck is the fact that we see all of these beloved characters interact together for the first time and then appropriately be chased by dinosaurs,Notr
I had a tooth extraction yesterday and I had a better time at the dentist than watching this film Its that bad how did the stars agree to such madnesssave your money dont waste  hours of your life,Notr
This was pretty much a copy of every other film in the series but not as fun as most They put just about everyone who survived all of the other films into one They were cutting between at least three groups or individuals in the middle act and by the end theres nine people running to get off the island It was all a bit much,Notr
Sorry this is just awful The story line and plot are just bad It is unfortunate because it had a really great cast and a lot of potential It honestly didnt even feel like it was a film about dinosaurs Too many subplots and pedestrian narratives at play,Notr
Laura Dern and Sam Neill are terrible Could have done without them in the movie Dern gives the worst performance Ive seen on the big screen in a long long time Her action looked forced and reminds me of a high school freshman in drama class Sam Neil looks lost in all his scenes Could have done without both of them in the movieJeff Goldblum was the opposite and made the best of a badly written movie At least his parts were entertainingThe movie was disappointing for it could have even so much more,Notr
The basic premise that dinosaurs are everywhere on the Earth opened up an entire world of possibilities for the script writers and unfortunately they fell back into some very basic Hollywood themes that are no longer interesting and in fact are more often than not insulting to the audienceThe legacy characters were so good in comparison that it should have been obvious to everyone the final movie would have been a lot better with just them with a cameo by Chris PrattTo try and explain the plot would take six different reviews because there were basically six plots that are very loosely connected and mostly dont resolve I could go into them and discuss them but that would mean I was putting more effort in than the screenwriters didSince its Hollywood in the s you know the good guys and bad guys based on facial hair and skin tone As Quentin Tarantino has commented many times we have regressed to s style serialized televisionRun from this one like you are being chased by a velociraptor,Notr
Was it a bit corny Yes Was there a lot of fan service Obviously yes Was it a fun movie Also yes You can go in expecting a fun movie and not have the need for it to be a masterpiece As a regular Jurassic movie it would be great but as the finale it falls flat,Notr
We watched the first  Jurassic films and except of part  we enjoyed all of them thoroughly so we didnt want to miss this one Part  was a bit boringIve read the reviews before we watched this film and think they dont do this movie any justice Neither is the th Jurassic film boring nor is there a dinosaur attack every  minutes People tend to exaggerate Dont take them seriousPart  has Laura Dern Ed Neill Jeff Goldblum and the two major actors from the previous films reunited and we also see Blue the cute raptor She now has a baby and the scenes with Blue and the baby are particularly touchingWhat I also enjoyed about this th part was for one thing the filming locations Malta and lots of new dinosaur types in close up scenesForget about all these lousy reviews simply give it a chance and enjoy this truly entertaining movie,Notr
How disappointing can a movie be watch this and you will find outHad great expectations for this bringing some of the old characters back but even that couldnt help this b grade at best movieSo many clichsand no real storyThis really should now be the end of the Jurassic Park franchiseThe first two with Chris pratt were enjoyable but this is just absolute garbage Nothing to do with pratt or any of the actors its the writers who should hang their heads in shame,Notr
This was just too overstuffed underwhelming and exhausting to have to sit through a  min runtime story that couldve easily been told in  minutes It was too much filler and not enough substance in between the UFC dino bouts that it felt we were watching a fivehour movie marathon Even the performances and actors expressions when they were face to face with the dinos felt more like a Disney Jurassic Park themed ride promo commercial,Notr
This is a fun action movie with dinosaurs however the politics of the films creators do not need to show up in every other scene of the movie Other than that its great,Notr
I absolutely had a blast seeing this dinosaurs flick Its heavy on nostalgia but its fun It was a lot of fun to see the mix of both the new and the old Im sad to see this series is over Overall not perfect but such a awesome cinematic experience,Notr
Three of the four stars are for Jeff and the dinosI only watched this in the cinema because a movie group chose to but after the last two i was not at all interested in seeing this movieThis movie was soWhite all the supporting cast actors were BIPOC but the story focuses on some of the whitest white actors out there and while this wouldnt bother me so much its a yearold franchise and they are still soWHITEIf anything its fun to see Jeff Goldblum be Jeff Goldblum and the dino scenes are a good time Just download it,Notr

It is sad to see how poor in their essence story and execution the woke movies are I struggled to watch this to the end Same distorted narrative about negative vs positive characters that dont reflect any reality The old characters are lifeless and it is easy to see they dont believe in the plot I love Sam Neill acting but in this case it was pretty sad to digest his acting The same has happened to many classics like Starwars Matrix and others They became unwatchableWhere are the Hollywood movies of the th century that were positive optimistic full of life and fun to watch I am actually wondering for how long Hollywood can keep this up until money talks and revenues bite Good luck keeping the audience engaged with these fake stories,Notr
I dont see why this movie gets so much hate It is a bit of a rehash of old ideas but it was always intended to wrap up the story There were multiple story lines in different locations including the Mediterranean The movie went in a positive direction with a message about coexistence which is a different take from the previous movies The dinosaurs were stunning as always The movie also had a lot of likable characters who made a lot of sacrifices to do what they think was right I suppose people were expecting an apocalypse movie Instead it made me wonder if we should bring back extinct creatures and give them a chance in the wild in real life,Notr
Stupid Acting IshSoundtrak hardlyCGI SubparDialog Script random wordsAction Lots  lots  lots Everyone is a CIA superspyexpert in everything Science unarmed combat computersScreaming lots of it per usualDwarma  through the whole dumbassed messI would rather get sunstroke than watch this pile of dino dung ever again  I thought  was bad,Notr
Without a doubt the worst yet something to surpass Jurassic Park  and Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom this is the final nail Such a terrible movie convenience at every turn shoehorned in political correctness and nostalgia treatment of the lowest quality that tries failingly to bridge the plot and make sense of what is happening From boring character to boring character there was lots of nothing going on A sad finale though one that has been long coming,Notr
I enjoyed the callbacks and the new stuff Id give a ten just for the chase scene that involved a Kei class van and dinosaurs laughed a bit in that part and can I forgive any plot holes and supposition Easy to watch and Im glad I did,Notr
I enjoyed this one more then any other sequal before this Its got everything The sleazy Tim Cook clone villain just nails it for me The CGI effects are better then most of ots current competition It cotains some solid action scenes and a few subtle funny moments as well Though it could have been a little better if they wrapped it up within two hours Its just a little too long And though the story is a bit predictable its different from its predecessors So if you just want to enjoy yourself without expecting a believable or deep storyline then this ones for you I recommand this one even if you only saw the original It simply does the job in serving its purpose,Notr

Jurassic World Dominion is an uninspired corporate product designed by a committee based on various graphs and research results from the test groupsThey did the basic scheme of  Pour a lot of money into a known IP  Dust off the actors from  years ago    ProfitA very costly but uninspired undertaking Only the product design team and the CGI crew showed their bests The actors knew what they were getting into and this shows Its slow full of cliches and selfrepeats Nobody is trying The message the film solidifies in the end was already solidified in  previous moviesI dont want to dig deeper into this There is no point It bored me to death and all the shots of the old cast with nostalgic music made me feel angry and manipulated I cant rate this either Rating this film a  would offend everyone who worked on it but I cant give it moreThe best thing about this film was that it created jobs and paid people for their work Thanks for thatNot recommended,Notr
Ignore the hatersits not a great masterpiece but its fun I really liked all the Easter eggs and it was great to see the old cast back Worth the money to see on the big screen Dont understand the hate because its non stop action and a fun ride,Notr
This movie definitely has its strong points The visuals are good with the dinosaurs looking fantastic and its a real visual feast The action while maybe not the absolute best in the series is still a blast and keeps things exciting The performances are solid with Isabella Sermon stepping up her game from the last film and Jeff Goldblum adding a dose of humor Plus the nostalgia factor is pretty sweet and the movie keeps a good pace to keep you entertainedHowever the weak link here is the story Its not terrible but it doesnt quite live up to the potential set by the previous film The villains are a letdown they lack any real threat and are easily forgettable The narrative can feel all over the place as it jumps around from one place to another So overall it might be the most disappointing entry in the series but its definitely not the worst thanks to its strong visuals fun action solid performances and that touch of nostalgia from the series,Notr
The previous films never held a candle to the original but they nevertheless had a cohesive plot we could grasp and follow the characters as they progressed through the dangers of Jurassic Park I cannot say the same at all about this film This film has more plot holes and poor character choices than a Steven Seagal film it makes Jurassic Park  look like Citizen Kane Bringing back the old characters felt more like window dressing out of nostalgia for the  film rather than make them important characters in this film,Notr
The movie is a  however one has to acknowledge the skills and hard work of those involved with creating this visual masterpiece The story wasnt much but I suspect the makers had a larger audience in mind considering schools out and kept it simple,Notr
The first half of the movie is a mishmash with too many characters and too many storylines to follow I wanted a family movie not a Brated spy action with some dinosaurs on the backC I A vs Mercenaries vs Other mercenaries who hire more mercenaries My yo watched the motorcycle chase with zero interest and finally asked wait whos chasing who again My yo just gave up and reached for her iphoneOh and lets throw in some old characters into this mess Because fan service ChachingIt gets better in the second half of the movie where it all goes back to the nature  adventure format But overall its still a disasterP S Jeff Goldblum still rocks though,Notr
What is with the reviews Movie was quite good Dinos were awesome and terrifying Loved seeing all the main characters come together Story was insane but at least better than Fallen Kingdom Served its purpose to tie together all of the excellent Dino scenesReviews are not fair at all Movie isnt not a  but its an easy  for the excellent Dino scenesGet Jurassic to the theatre its the only way to see this one,Notr
I am a huge fan of Jurassic Park always been The new World series was not great but it had its moments with a descent plot and dinosaurs being in the centre I was looking forward to Dominion Unfortunately the third and final movie does not deliver and probably is the worst of all I am not going to go into details but it feels as if someone wanted to record a movie with dinosaurs but lost the essence behind it The film has a lot of dinosaurs in it multiple species but the randomness poor plot and lack of heart from the director make this a forgettable experience,Notr
If you love Jurassic park and know everything about it and will notice all the Easter eggs from certain parts in the script even to camera angles youll like not love but like this film You can tell they tried really hard to make reference to the original movie here which I appreciated and I enjoyed picking out Easter egg after Easter egg Are there certain parts that dont make sense yes but its Jurassic World does any of it really make sense Who cares just bury the logic and enjoy the ride and have fun with itWith some great callbacks and final resolutions for some story arcs its worth a watch for any Jurassic fan,Notr
"Well the idiocy is off the scale with this one
The entire budget was blown on the CGI no money left for anyone to provide any guidance on anything remotely scientific and intelligent
Multiple efforts to ram the message down your throat are included as is the forced diversity resulting in unbelievable characters
Yes it is as bad as you have heard sorry
Idiotic characters Idiotic story Lack of anything remotely close to logic
Watch it without the dialogue
it makes no difference",Notr
"I went to have fun Its Colin and millions of dollars It should be good right
The story was so convoluted It was always tense and unease but no threat It was bad dialogue by a grade actorsThe cgi was hit and miss Some was absolutely spectacular Others stood out like a saw thumb And the ending It was lack lusterHonestly wait for tv",Notr
After the ending of the last film it left me and Im sure everyone else very excited to see what the action will be like when the dinosaurs will roam the planet Disappointingly there was hardly any action it was so slow and long that I was begging for the film to end Save yourself time and money and avoid this boring film,Notr
Look this movie like every blockbuster has its flaws but its expected with these films Im a Jurassic Park fan and youll never beat the OG but this movie is very entertaining and fast paced probably too fast paced for some and maybe thats one of its flaws or pros depending how you look at it Hopefully the extended version when it releases helps with thatBut overall this movie is awesome even after seeing it twice ,Notr
I dont usually write reviews but this movie was so bad I felt I needed too I was extremely excited for this movie and I should have just walked out I kept holding on that it might get better it never did This is on the worst movies I have seen in recent memory This movie had absolutely nothing to do with dinosaurs they were just kind of there while this script chased two different story lines trying desperately to merge them together at the end Neither of which had anything to do with dinosaurs or coexisting together That came at the last mins Terrible way to end an otherwise outstanding franchise Dont waste your money,Notr
The film is not bad but it disappointed me New and historical characters are not used convincingly and history has bored me A disappointing film that does not end the Jurassic World saga as it should,Notr
The third and final entry in the Jurassic World trilogy and an overall conclusion to the original Jurassic Park series A satisfying conclusion with lots of entertainment and thrillful moments The best entry in the Jurassic World trilogy and I dont care about the unnecessary hate this film getting and I find it ridiculous because this film made especially for the true Jurassic Park fans,Notr
The story is just another below average although the few actors are good The special effect is just average but the stunts are poorDirectorship is below average this timeThe story should be rewritten because too common nothing exciting The director also did not make it good enough to be excitedI cannot give high due to the dropped standard from previous series The most is  only This is just another average movie nothing to get really excite and not worth top pay watch in cinema I only recommend to watch at home with a small charges if you are a fan,Notr
Ive watch every jurassic movies  I love every movies but there is one problem that is same story I mean by putting og characters doesnt mean that this movie best ever Now  first I will talk about positive things  Nobody will gonna accept that it has very good VFX  it gives reallastic shot second new dinosaures and third that featuring kiddnapping of bluechild  Now  negitave weak polt  same story and predictable action and climax  So if you are interested to watch the flim  you can with your family and dont expect any new thing I am thinking that the makers wanted sequel or for timepass,Notr
"Millions of dollars hours work etc To end up with this great ball of cliches And its even worst mix and mush up Jurassic Park Indiana Jones Impossible mission Avatar and many many others films then you have this result

Reel Tunez Movie Review  Jurassic Park DominionNot the best J P Not the worst J P But it does bring both the initial three and most recent two Jurassic Parks together and wraps up the seriesIts cool bringing the original cast back together and bringing them into the new Jurassic Park worldAt about   hours it runs long and is full of actions screams and loudness Its a fun popcorn movie and the effect look good though not further improved from the last two Its worth seeing on the big screenIt does seem like they really chopped it at the last minute almost haphazardly as a blonde villain character was on the scene made a big presence than just seemed to vanishId give it about a  out of  Certainly worth seeing but also it probably wont be the best movie or even top  you see this year,Notr
Its interesting how most of the  star reviews are very short this says a lot basically that we dont want this film to take up anymore time we wasted watching itThis movie is made for the late fans of jurassic park the original movie has far more impact the original movie has only  dino screen time where this film has about  dino screen time which kills everything about what jurassic park set out to doThe worst part of the movie is how much the director tries to tie in scenes and recreate scenarios and legendary moments from the original film Spielberg did this because he is a fantastic filmmaker this director did this to please fans Nothing comes good from people pleasing in any situation in life,Notr
Worst Jurassic movie I have ever seen there is an unnecessary dinosaur fight every  minutes and just when you think the problem is resolved another dinosaur emerges out of nowhere I cant believe I paid to see that Id rather sit on the toilet and watch my pubes grow I saw my grandad hack up flem this year and jurassic world domination is still number one on my most disgusting watch of  listDo not even get me started on the clone girl  Charlotte Lockwood like dont get me wrong the acting must be pretty good because for me to be so physically angered by one character Do yourself a favour and dont waste your money on watching it because now I have to waste my money on therapy after seeing that,Notr
I was turned down by many negative reviews and almost did not want to see this movieBut in the ends its a pretty fun ride The FX are top notch the story is somewhat yeah we have seen it before but even thenIts not the best movie ever but its better than the last  Jurassic world movies,Notr

Ya the movie is kind of dumb and crazy but also your on  of a dinosaur franchise So ya things are ridiculous but lots of cool action and definitely better then fallen kingdom that ones just dumb and not much redeeming in it,Notr
Not scary not even thrilling There were kids in the theater and even they were boredThe whole point of Jurassic Park is the fear that the ancient predators are SUPPOSED to invoke The terror from the original for me came when chars did everything logical and still got eaten In this you can out run raptors on foot hide barely a inch underwater slowly walk away from a dino as long as theres a car between you and if you do get cornered without a weapon just hold out your hand WTF The writers have been watching too much How to Train Your Dragon Why was the whole movie about locusts and not the dinosaurs They couldve at least made them carnivorous locusts and had a scene where they stripped a bronto to bones in minutes At least theres be some real threat in this pointless movie Im joking but it mightve been a better movie if they took half the human leads out and had Blue the raptor fight her way through all the new species herselfSave your money Gas food and tickets are too expensive now to be wasted on this movie,Notr
The first one is still by far the best story of them all and this one has a story I wasnt particularly interested in but Id feel like a total heal to rate this any lower than a  due to the effort that went into creating the incredible special effects If it wasnt for those this would basically put you to sleep and I did find myself nodding off during one of the few moments lacking much action But go into this to admire the artistry in the movie making itself and I think youll enjoy the experience That said I sure hope they dont make another one because there is no more story to tell and theyve reached the peak on dinosaur action,Notr
From the opening seconds onwards this movie is so so so bad and brainless And it doesnt get better throughoutI seriously thought this is a parody At least I had a good laugh over how bad this is compared to the original Jurassic Park,Notr
Not wonderful but still a good summertime movie and fits right in with the other five movies Loved the callbacks to the other moviesyou cant make sequels without having callbacks  Not nearly as bad a movie as all of these reviews are making it out to be  out of  stars,Notr
Jurassic Park was wonderful Very good adaptation of Crichtons novel The sequels Meh and more meh And Dominion is a perfect example of how Hollywood has one good idea and then beats it into the ground over and over because they have no imagination or creativityThe best thing I can say about Dominion is that I got to watch it for free so I wasnt out any money on it,Notr
Theres nothing like what those former Jurassic Park sequels Just hope this is the last So hollow and pointless So boring because theres no essence in this movie thats interesting enough to hold our attention Is put up one hand with palm forward the only way to hold off the dinosaurs a hand gesture these wild vicious creatures would recognize and start thinking Hmm thats an universal traditional friendly STOP sign so popularly accepted by our species not to attack Are these human traffic cops trying to direct our movements No Right Turn on RED This is one of the most boring movies so far in ,Notr
Filled with characters and scenes to capture the nostalgia of Jurassic Park but failed to succeed in the general feeling of the original They couldnt even keep it in the same genre Dominion is a straight up action movie just with dinosaurs Its more reminiscent of a Mission Impossible movie than a Jurassic Park film The original was actually full of suspense and terror even a bit of gore In this there is really none of thatGrant Sattler and Malcolms return was the saving grace And actually making Dodgson the antagonist was pretty cool as well It was a showcase for some new dinosaurs but otherwise not much else going for itI will always love this franchise based on the original and how revolutionary it was in filmmaking Ive enjoyed the other films they look amazing and they have thoroughly entertained including this one But Im glad this is the end for now because the story telling has run its course and you can tell its exhausted Possibly in  years they could look at continuing it in some way but a very long break is needed,Notr
A return of all the originals What more could you ask for to wrap up the nd trilogy Laura Dern Jeff Goldblum were my highlights Im glad it seemed all  of the main cast got equal screen time and it wasnt overpowered by the Bryce Dallas Howard and Pratt TBH I had completely forgotten the storyline with the girl but overall I thought it was a very fun action Dinosaur movie,Notr
New drinking game idea Take a shot every time Chris Pratt holds his hand up in the air and has a staring contest with a dinosaur Guaranteed youll be wasted within the first forty minutes of the movie It was fun to see the original cast come back and it had some good dinosaur scenes that my little brother really enjoyed Beyond that though this installment just didnt do it for me which is a shame because I love Jurassic Park and thought the first Jurassic World was actually very decent But this one is way too long and drawn out cringe writing at times annoying characters and strange pacing The villain aka the guy who looks eerily identical to Apple CEO Tim Cook did they do that on purpose was terribly written and completely useless Im glad I waited to watch this at home instead of going to the theater at least that way I could doze off between scenes in the comfort of my living room,Notr
"We go back in time w Laura Dern Jeff Goldblum  Sam Neill joining the newer younger generation of Chris Pratt etc

Long boring and predictable movie Since Spielberg created Jurassic Park no one has been able to go further Same format same stupid story same gags in every movie How boring Who says that the dinosaurs every time they have to eat you they have to mwttwrsi to scream like idiots  In the midst of an immense forest how likely are you to encounter a tyrannosaurus And to find  of them all together near the helicopter  In the obsession of surprising in reality you are bored Everything already seen reviewed and seen again  Do you want to surprise Do something more realistic These scripts smell of mold,Notr
I can understand those who dont like the film as its one for those who have been with Jurassic park from the startI watched them all as they came out and went to cinema and for me this movie was great from a nostalgic point of viewIt was fab to see the original cast and learn how they had evolved over the year and come full circleThere are multiple storylines running along side each other the old versus the new and yet these storylines are all running towards joining the old and the new togetherI watched the extended version and feel like as a fan and viewer Ive been given the perfect ending to a storyline I grew up with,Notr
This was the laziest way to end the Jurassic World trilogy such sad and poor writing Nothing wrong with the acting obviously when someone cant act in big budget film  its noticeable Just a lousy way to end the franchise,Notr
If youre truly bored and have hm and want to poke fun criticize and be astonished how Hollywood can screw up a franchise feel free I would not pay money for it I feel for those that didI wont offer spoiler alerts Theres not much of a plot anyway I will share however what I learnedIf this evers come to life we need to have and do some things One hold our hands up and palms out Apparently this is effective and is understood by dinos Two have a taser and knife These are apparently way more effective than guns Dinos try to eat people in the movie but they should not be harmed right Three guns are bad mmkay What a stupid asinine place to put an agenda Its a dino moviePoorly done Hollywood I understand contractual obligations but man Pratt should apologize for this one and the legacy stars deserve an apologyBurt Macklin would have done better especially without open hands tasers and knives,Notr

"RATED 
Language EnglishCompared to previous version this one is little disappointment But still entertainment to watch The initial scenes and the dominion was nicely shown after that it travels to the templated evil scientist and his money minded inventionsIf they concentrated more on dinosaurs then the science it would be sure hit The dinosaurs become Pet and less dangerous We can use taser to control the dinosaurs And some scenes the GFX is clearly visibleOne time watchable if you are expecting pure masala action movie with dinosaurs",Notr

I saw the reviews before going to see this movie so I had low expectations but I gotta say this movie isnt that bad in fact its pretty good Its a TON of fun and the original characters add some life to this movie that felt missing from the other Jurassic World films The plot is the only thing that kind of doesnt work but even so its not bad its just passable The action scenes are amazing and the adventurous globetrotting feel of this movie makes it stand out from the others The dinosaurs of course are awesome and there are some touching scenes with them here In the end its kind of the dinosaurs themselves that are the emotional center of this film Best Jurassic movie since The Lost World,Notr
Movies Ive ever seen in my life Almost walked out of the theater but my wife wouldnt let me Everyone involved in the making of this film should retire from their work immediately It was that bad Sorta like  of everything else outta the entertainment business in the last decade,Notr
Now where have we heard this before Why is it the Hollywood trend appears to be finding the balance of the better the special effects the sillier the storyThis one takes the biscuit Throw in the compulsory wonderful genius blm advert characters to even further break down the fourth wall and basically its only worth watching for the albeit impressive effects so bring your eyeballs but leave your brains at homeWas nice to wear the D specs again although nothing really jumped out at me,Notr

I saw this movie is weste totally waste of time my verdict is dont watch the movie because its totally lag and its a normal Hollywood movies and there is no high graphics weast movie As we all know science fiction when it is done well reflects social and political tensions back to the culture in disguised forms so that we take them in and metabolize them without really knowing what it is that we are consuming In Jurassic World we are transported into the perilous mindscape of radical feminism where in accordance with the tradition and finally i says about the movie is totally boring,Notr
With this much money and this many iconic actors coming back you would think they could make something good What a complete  from the original movie It was just sad watching all of the new Jurassic series I wish the would start making movies like they used to Take risks hire people based on talent START with an excellent story Anyway do not watch this movie is you care about good story and good film making This movie was just sad and hard to watch It was all just pointless It was all just boring You didnt care Colin Trevor needs to stop being allowed to make movies He is probably one of the worst directors in the industry,Notr

I think it wrapped up closure for other plot lines in the series that fans wanted to see It had similar scenes but those are to be expected in the franchise It was nostalgic and cool to see how they merged the two casts into a unified plot line Lots of action Wish it had more dinosaurs Some of it was predictable But I love the franchise and support it It was entertaining and I think everyone will have a different perspective of what they think would have made it better I am glad the original cast came back The acting was better than expected Scenes seemed to flow well It was high action at times,Notr
Havent seen it havent put a score but just clicked on all  reviews and what a surprise that the only review those users have ever written are of this movie Ill just leave it at that Those reviews are obviously too shallow to be credible but its just sad,Notr
Jurassic park was from the beginning an adventure story with likeable characters and an anticorporate message  incoorporating dinosaurs This movie fits the bill Some plots were a little iffy but overall you have a great cast some callbacks and motivation for every character Even new characters that are not just bland That is some achievement in and on itself So basically everything that the star wars franchise aims to achieve but failsAction is great and almost nonstop camera editing practical vs cgi The only thing that i am missing are the spielbergian pauses which let the information sink in and make the anticipation of what is to come even greaterAs far as franchises go slightly below marvel well above star wars,Notr
Even OG cast couldnt save the atrocious storyline I guess the writer completely missed the mark on what we fans were expecting The last movie Dinosaurs escaped to mainland and now humans and dinosaurs will need to coexist Its like the writers didnt even see what happened in Jurassic Park part  lost world where TRex caused havoc when loose on mainland This movie shouldve been more of an apocalyptic feel humans trying to survive GovernmentArmies failing safe zones being breached and overall carnage where the OG cast somehow ends up reuniting to come up with a plan to save human speciesInstead we get the same crap as the last  movies a fancy secure building that gets breached a rich greedy CEO and everything just falling apart as usual No purpose for OG cast to be there Super lazy writing and screenplay No originality feeling Felt like a hotpodge cash grab messOn positive side visuals were stunning,Notr
"OK it was an enjoyable movie for a rainy afternoon So comfortable but I have trouble remembering the actual plot now its people we care about and rogue dinosaursyou should know what youre getting into by now Thankfully no running in high heelsI did spend a lot of time worrying about the corn Bryce Dallas Howard was shucking when she had to run after the dinos It was a perfect looking cob of corn Bright yellow Luscious

Most of this film is how can we hurt the dinosaurs or have them hurt each other No character has growth no positive development through the story Last movie was kill all the dinosaurs in a volcano eruption and watch them die and this time lets put them all in a sanctuary and then burn it down Why the constant need to kill all the dinos This crew should really be able to do better by this point Very unimpressed,Notr
Another generic Jurassic Park movie full of bad CGIActors are good but the CGI makes the movie look tame and unrealisticI wish they made the Jurassic Park movies like the first two movies More practical effects as it looks more realistic compare TRex or Velociraptors from the first movie with this Its day and nightThis is just another cheap maybe not the budget but how it looks generic way to actionpacked child friendly movie like Hollywood is spamming out nowadaysI wish movie makers had the balls to take chances like they did back in the day when Hollywood was goodNow they rely too much on CGI because its safe But it makes the movies not have a realistic feeling to itId say I will give it a  star max and thats solely because of the actors makes it watchableWithout them it would be a  star,Notr
This was amazing On the genetic aspect the movie might be thin but on the ecological aspect this movie hits hard The way it depicts the beauty of evolution and the importance of coexistence is incredible Coexistence is something humanity needs to do with the rest of the planet to achieve balance and prevent all the world threatening problems I know that there are a lot of negative reviews about this movie but what I am saying is this movie conveys a really tough message It is a true science fiction film not like the superhero movies which are made just for entertainment It not just a movie its an emotion,Notr
Ofcourd science fiction needs you to have a open mind However there is a fine line between down right ridiculousness and science This movie is so far over that line that it becomes unbearable to watch even with a open mind Want to see a good jurassic park movie rent the original,Notr
Not a bad film Good cinematography takes us through an action packed adventure Some lines are cheesy expected as this is a commercial family film I enjoyed this much more than Jurassic world  I found the story to be far more engaging and old characters sure spiced it up Undeniably though the plot was too scripted at times you would just wait for the good guys to triumph as it is impossible for them to lose a sense of risk or realism would have helped to keep the audience on their toesNot a bad watch at all ,Notr
I just saw the movie on streaming Now I wish I would have seen it in theaters At that time it was getting bad reviews online so I did not goAnyway it was a pretty good movie some action interesting story with Ellie and Grant doing some  like detective workThe storyline with Owen and Blue was a little overdone but it did not detract too much from enjoying the movieI really dont understand the bad reviews it is a scifi dinosaur movie Dont expect these types of movie to always make sense and follow real world scienceDominion is a fun and entertaining movie and I plan to watch it again,Notr
Does it matter The dinosaurs barely got any screen time This is the worst movie in the franchise The writing is poor the acting is off and it isnt engagingHow the hell are people out in civilization living their lives normally when there are dinosaurs looseWhat sums up how poorly done this movie is can be seen just in the intro The Giga and the Rex did not live in the same time period come on,Notr
We all know what we want from these movies and I think this movie succeeded at that It has a a bit of everything  the storyline is well paced  could have been shorter tho  the action was so cool  especially the Malta parts  However I do think the movie was suffocating itself with so many characters and dialogues,Notr
Look all the negative comments on the movie is already stated below with the boring script lack of suspense so onOh that hand Chris Pratt holds up thatll really ward off those dinosaurs What kind of idiot thought that was a good ideaLook my problem is the total PC always in theses movies Whats the point of narrative when it comes to the main point it lacking in what you want on this type of filmI would not recommend this movie to even my enemies thats how bad it was thats saying something It is a marketing movie not a movie for the future to look back and say that was a great because of ABC reasonsRubbish totally forgettable movieHope this director is NOT making movies in the future,Notr

Huge fan of Jurassic Park Loved the story line and how they were successfully able to connect the past and new characters so well It was brilliant how they were able to bring back little bits from all the previous movies while adding a new dimension to this one Such a great film and so worth seeing in theater It goes to show how great the films have been and how great the fans have been when all the characters are willing to come back for a finale showdown,Notr
This movie is everything I expected it to be loud dumb and over the top action packed I was neutral about this movie its so bad that its almost good What definitely worked for this movie was bringing back characters from the original films I enjoyed seeing Neil and Dern along side Dallas and Pratt as well as the newcomers Wise and Athie However a lot didnt work like the storyline Its generic and I expected much more The dinosaurs are almost an after thought in this storyline placed second to gigantic locusts yes silly I know Not horrible but wasted opportunity I would have preferred the movie expanding on humans living with dinosaurs in a modern world and exploring the moral and ethical debates that go along with it It briefly touched on that but didnt dive in before creating some bogus plot about a corporation out to disrupt the food chain Could have had some thought provoking yet terrifying and majestic scenes instead of the over utilized evil corporation tries to take over the world plot,Notr
Honestly disappointed I went in with low expectations but this movie didnt even meet them Yes the dinosaurs were pretty cool and had great animation It is not good enough to save the atrocious plot of this movie I was ready for the movie to be over an hour in and felt bored most of the movie All of the tension was forced and it was so predictable To the point where I could count down from three to my wife to predict a larger dinosaur would pop out Im thankful that this movie brought my wife and I closer over our shared laughter at the ridiculous plot I wont see these movies in theater any longer Im so glad it was free,Notr

I saw the ratings here on IMDB and waited for it to stream instead of seeing it in theaters I regret that decision It was a fairly decent movie Id say that the story line used a lot of elements that Ive already seen in other movies and wasnt original such as the evil corporation Also the movie was a bit too long I was expecting more of an End of the World vibe and it was certainly lacking in that department That being said it doesnt deserve less than a six rating I give it a seven I love that they brought back so many actors from the original Jurassic Park and the urban scenes were really cool There just needed to be more and they just barely missed the mark,Notr
First of all I love Pratt and Neill and the rest of the cast but they need a good story line Dominion does not that Very weak and one bizarre scene after another see Maverick instead if you are seeking sentiment SKIP,Notr
Colin Trevarrow has hit the final nail on the franchises coffin by deviating from the central dinosaur themed storyline with bland dinosaur shots introducing new uninteresting characters and a weak antagonist The movie takes inspiration from modern day kaiju movies where the characters are secondary to the primary monster duels which has greatly affected the orginal franchises plot and character based storyline The movie could have been directed better by Michael Bay with more explosions and no dinosaurs The movie makes dinosaur lovers grind their teeths in frustration Overall a disappointing conclusion to a great franchise,Notr
"Unlike JW Fallen Kingdom which featured amazing classic horror elements this movie doesnt present something new to the franchise and thats not bad but it could have done something betterInstead of feeling like a dinosaur movie with action and adventure it feels like an action movie with dinasaurs in itMinor spoiler incoming

Story was not that good of the level of Jurrassic Park  or Missing of horror scare and nostalgia of the level of previous sequels The horror when a person or child is trying to save himself from unpredective dinosaur was missing here",Notr
My  years old son loved the entire movie He likes the raptors and the dynasours fightsAs for me who watched all the previous ones it felt it is just purely commercial addition They brought the old cast back with no clear role compared to SpiderMan no way home where it was funny and has a purposeOverall still entertaining for new generation,Notr

I guess I care more about a plot it was all over the place so basically there wasnt one the original Jurassic Park magic zero here just a show and tell of beasts and the exact same escape situations youve seen  times before the acting the little girl was HORRIBLE Chris Pratt was wooden and seemed irritated that the other actors were in the movie Laura Dern thought she was in a fashion show instead of a movie Jeff Goldblum was just plain weird and must have gone off script so the film editor hacked up his dialogue All of those in a movie are distracting and not enjoyableThe only good things were Sam Neill at  looked AMAZING and I loved this black lady who was a pilot yet she only had about minutes of screen timeAlso I absolutely hate it when a movie preaches to me and then ends the movie with what they THINK is an original profound statement that youve seen and heard a  times before which was  we can all get along and live in harmony no matter how different we are Yawn,Notr
Been super hyped and left super impressed Wasnt surprised about dodgson being a replaced actor though and a menace and dumb Also i dont understand the woke negativity of jurassic world  As i was completely fine with it and not seeing what the critics saw The story was brilliant and thrilling and very action packed and menacing And very adorable And the legacy and current cast blending is somewhat outstanding This movie gave me so many memories in many scenes with how the scenes played out The issue is dont take someone to see a film if they dont understand the story arc Just dont take anyone with you who lacks interest Otherwise the experience for you will get ruined Ive seen all the jurassic films going way back to the first film in  The hype for me was worth it,Notr

Its a good film all things considered The problem is that people are judging this movie not on what it had to follow the previous film was horrible If I produced themes and ideas that should not have been introduced So then you have to sequel it well this is what you get The previous movie introduced cloning a girl that was allowed to do something really stupid at the end a character that has never been mentioned it was bad This film had to one follow that and make up for the idiocy that it entailed and be its own thing It did that admirably The old and new casts were on hand They wrapped up storylines There were some really good action scenes and beautiful scenery and dinosaurs So before you start casting stones try to relate to the task they had,Notr
Jurassic World Dominion a fitting end to a epic trilogy of jurassic sized movies almost a avengers style sized movie that brings the new trio and old trio together in an attempt to save humanity on the brink of extinctionUpon reading reviews and reports I was sceptical about going to see this expecting dissatisfaction and disappointment and but got a rollercoaster end to a epic movie franchise I wont be relying on movie reviews to see future cinema moviesThrillingly exciting with epic turns and twists at every turn A final curtain call on the jurassic era of cinema films A must see movie to end the journey excitingmovie excitingmovie starsjurassicworlddominion moviereviews moviereviewsblog moviereviewer SpoilerFreeReview,Notr
It is unrealistic too drawn out the plot is lousy and seems non existent It just has scenes that are action packed yet unsatisfying The timing makes it more absurd The lines are so vapid The stars featured do not distract me from how bad it isThe most original things are little noticable things that still do not make it worthwhile such as a flying motorcycle and people sneaking into a prohibited area It is sickening I am glad that I was treated to this garbage but disheartened that I had to sit through it I recommend skipping it,Notr
Four years after Isla Nublar was destroyed dinosaurs now liveand huntalongside humans all over the world This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine once and for all whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with historys most fearsome creaturesThe movie is driven by action and visual effects with little care given to things like character development or a wellwritten plot The pace is fast and the movie is exciting but its forgettable The dialogue is often cheesy and the acting is just okay with Sam Neill Jeff Goldblum and Chris Pratt phoning it in There are a few themes that pop up such as the dangers of messing with nature but they are quickly abandoned in favour of more actionJurassic World Dominion is a movie that is best enjoyed as a mindless popcorn flick Its not going to win any awards but its entertaining enough If youre a fan of the franchise youll enjoy it If youre not this movie isnt going to change your mind,Notr
First off this feels like a mission impossible movie with dinosaurs LOLThe animation on this is horrible as well The puppets are just as bad The original movie that was made  years ago had better animation and puppets What is going onThey charge us full cinema prices but they skimp on animation Im doneChris Pratt what are you doing man Enough is enough You are an A list movie start Dont sell out,Notr
The movie was fine nothing special We get to see dinosaurs as if we lived with themYou need to remember this is the th dinosaurs movie like it doesnt really have anywhere to go to be specialEnjoy it for what it is the th movie about humans bring dinosaurs back to life and now they live amongst us,Notr
I took ten yo boys to this movie to kick off summer vacation and we almost left we were all so bored My son  I loved the other movies but this was embarrassing Cant believe the corny dialog No story What a waste Waited a year and a total disappointment Surprised all of the actors signed on I know its  but ,Notr
Something or everything just seemed way off about this movie The actors were not all there and their interactions with their environment and dinosaur counterparts were so uneven unnatural and inharmoniousThe attempt at reunion of two generations of actors was too on the nose to have any impact Most of the screen play was just a rehearsal of what has been seen before There was also too many overly convenient set pieces to push forward an already absent plot Too easy for the characters to get out of seemingly dangerous situations and all attempts at any tension fell flat Also no character development what so ever Agreed these are characters we are already familiar with but not a single character can have a progression come on The villain also is a joke as are the locusts and their pointless involvement in the storyIts not all bad because theres is outstanding visuals and some world building that was left unexplored Not enough to save this movie from being forgettable,Notr
The only way this film would have been worse is if the Velociraptor started speaking to Chris Pratt Ridiculous Joyless CashGrabLazy actingscript must have been written by a toddler who has a dinosaur figuremixed with actors who wont get a big payout like this for the rest of their careersexcept Chris PrattTragic,Notr
Very disappointingCGI has many flaws and the storyline is not coherent They have tried to improve the movie by bringing the original stars from the previous movies but that did not help The story is weak and lacks coherent,Notr
This is so far the worst movie of the series If they want to make another Jurassic movie i hope they go back into horror root instead of this stupid action mission impossible fast  furious chris pratt movie,Notr
What an amazing end to the franchise Exactly what you expect out of a big budget summer blockbuster  percent popcorn popping entertainment Not youre saying old Jurassic Park but at the same time paying homage to the original Loved every minute of it,Notr
Ultimately a movie that tries to pay homage to the past movies and ends up being a reunion rather than a story Lots of silly references to the earlier movies crowbarred in often leaving gaping plot holes The movie also seems to try and cram in lots of additional species missed from the earlier films presumably in a bid to please fans but instead it interferes with the story or leads to poor action scenes the final Dino fight for instanceUltimately disjointed it feels like half of the movie is on the cutting room floor It surely wouldve worked better in  parts with more story building There are also just too many dumb moments characters teleporting to the same place extras ignoring gianttheropods eating people right behind them characters forgetting that guns kill dinos I could go onAs a huge JP fan this is a sad ending to the reboot Sadly all mindless action and reminiscing If you turn your brain off its fun enough but ultimately the worst film of them all by some margin,Notr
The story doesnt make any sense Too much bland and unnecessary long runtime Its a just short  min movie The movie just looped the same  min again and again in different places Please showcase the hand of Chris Patt in the museum to stop tsunamis and any upcoming diseases Just show the hand and it will automatically solve all the problemsThe whole movie wasnt about dinosaurs its all about the stupid hand of Chris PattThe writer is confused about what to write for the movie Completely disaster Jurassic Park should stop and make the movie named  The problem Solver hand,Notr
I think critics are being too hard on this move Im a huge Jurassic Park fan so seeing some of the original cast return was exciting Its just the the plot is nonexistent and a lot of scenes seemed forced and cringey Dont get me wrong its not unbearable but I felt they couldve done a lot better It was disappointing that they focused more on the people more than they did the actual dinosaurs Though I will admit it was cool to see different species on screen but they didnt get enough screen time unfortunately While I liked this one better than Fallen Kingdom and was able to enjoy it with the action scenes and nostalgia a lot of the writing really downgraded it,Notr
Just Watch it yesterday and it was quite fun movie I love visual effect CGI Dinosaurs they make it super gorgeous but some of the Dinosaurs looks like a robot kinda remind me of Star Wars monster I love the cinematography looks super great and make the visual of the movie more beautiful the story umm at the beginning of the movie the plot story was kinda weird but going to ending the story was getting better and better some of the acting was like overacting Idk it just look like not natural and the pace to sometimes fine sometimes no But ya this movie is still fun to watch,Notr
Take all the things that made the original great  acting script cgi score and scenery  remove that and you have this movie What an absolute trash homage with actors phoning it in for an international audience,Notr
This franchise should have been extinct since  The original cast is here for the paycheck The new cast is laughable The plot is Does this movie even have one The CGI looks fake as hell Its boring Nothing specially thrilling happens Theres no payoff Rubbish,Notr
Except the action sequences because the noise wouldnt let me I slept most of the time Actors have acted pathetically Two stars for the bike chase sequence rest is all seen multiple times before Stop making Jurassic movies,Notr
Spoiler free reviewThere have been a lot of mixed reviews for this one including a  rotten tomato score from criticsIve just finished watching this and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it Now I do need to point out that if plot holes unrealistic set pieces and an underdeveloped politicaleconomicsocial world are issues then please avoid films with dinosaurs in the modern worldI also need to state that my expectations for dinosaur movies are Dinosaurs Dinosaurs fighting each other Dinosaurs eating people Pretty people to look atI was not disappointedIts mad fun its daft in places its thrilling there are some great throwback moments Its fantastic to see the cast together and overall its a great conclusion to the franchise so far,Notr
I think others have been to harsh Yes its familiar territory but well edited good acting and some laughs spot The Shining reference I thought the running time would be too long but it my attention throughout Screen time is well shared among the cast and the sub plots work well together Nice to see Laura and Sam get together at the end and and Isabella Sermon and Wanda deWise are very watchable Some people really need to chill out and just eat their popcorn,Notr
Jurassic World Dominion is a messy but fun movie Seeing the old and new cast and characters interact was just awesome but the many plotpoints get overwhelming at times and make it hard to follow along with the story The dinosaurs dont really get the spotlight as the movie has a Political Theme going on with life living with the Dinosaurs The size and scope is the biggest weve ever gotten from a Jurassic Movie spanning to different continents and locations which makes for some fun scenes with Dinosaur Chases and Dinosaur Overall not what I had in mind to be the epic conclusion to the saga but still enjoyable So as the tagline for this review I have to call it fun but really flawed It didnt bore me in any way and I was still able to enjoy the movie and have fun with it but it had a HECK TON of Problems,Notr
Bringing back the original cast of Jurassic Park works very well in this film and is one of the rare good things about this movie The action sequences are terrific and the pacing of this movie is perfect Some things that didnt work out in this film were its obsession with clich raptor Blue Leave her alone already And the plot itself which was stupid and pointless to begin with Overall its a good film to watch it at least once or twice,Notr
So many holes in the script Has Hollywood run out of ideas Why do they keep making sequels to mediocre movies They spent a fortune on this flick and this is the best they could do shame,Notr
Imagine having your name attached to this movie Truly awful The dialoged was cringe the SFX were awful and the plot was so stupid I couldnt believe it Obviously this is nowhere near the original thats a given but this is also so much worse than the previous two Jurassic World movies It didnt even entertain me accidentally or ironically I only finished it because I wanted to see if I could withstand it mentally as some sort of confidence building trophy for myself Kinda like that scene in Planes Trains and Automobiles where Steve Martin goes off on Del in the hotel room How can you stand it Because Ive been with Del Griffith,Notr
Obviously nothing is ever going to be as good as the original Jurassic Park  and every film since hasnt been but theyve all been good This one is also good It kept me glued to the screen Maybe a bit of nostalgia is making me a bit biased but it kept me entertained isnt that what a films meant to do,Notr
I love and I mean LOVE Jurassic Park and I knew this film wouldnt be great so I went in with low expectations but wow this movie is a mess it doesnt feel like Jurassic Park The actors seem like they were paid to try and downplay their acting to give the movie a special sense of corn I was  minutes in before I knew this movie was a fail The best part of this movie is I now know who produced it so I can stay clear of any garbage he tries to come up with next There is no adventure no excitement and nothing exciting about this movie My favorite part is going to be when this garbage heap ends so I can watch anything else other than this,Notr
It is far form being the best of the Jurassic movies for sure but it is nowhere near as bad as I feared from reading some of the reviews Yes the storyline is not great and the first  minute or so were less than exciting It did however get better as it went on and it was great to see Drs Grant Sattler and Malcolm from the original three films and if one can put the plot weakness out of mind for a time there are some genuinely thrilling and exciting moments in the movie Above all there are the dinosaurs the real stars of the show  and dont they know it We get to see new ones like Baryonyx Allosaurus and Atrociraptor as well as old favourites such as Brachiosaurus Velociraptor and of course TRex without which no Jurassic movie would be complete Yes TRex was from the Upper Cretaceous as were most animals in these movies but just go with it So if you love dinosaurs its worth watching just to see them in action once more especially TRex who never disappoints,Notr
How can this movie be done so poorly How can the special effects be so bad in  Also why do we have the same old tired lines and dialogue decades later Why does a dinosaur take so long to eat someone Its it has to look above the car under the car into the preys eyes and then pose for a photoshoot It all seemed so stupid I mean at the beginning of the movie Chris Pratt makes a promise to a dinosaur Its insulting to the audience This movie was long and boring and I was actually hoping the dinosaurs get to eat some of these boring tired characters I could not care less about what happens to any of them I still have  min left of the movie but I felt compelled to write this review while still watching it,Notr
"The makers of this movie were so preoccupied with whether they could make it that they didnt stop to think if they shouldBloated plot lines even more bloated cast that they couldnt think what to do with shameless pandering to the fans of the original by shoehorning in Grant Sattler and Malcolm and retconning new pointless characters
The plot has zero continuity and the acting dont get me started on the acting Not even Sam Neill could inject any life into this pile of pointless garbageIf you are not  years old or you are a fan of the original movies you should avoid this at all costs",Notr
As a fan of the previous  Jurassic movies You will like this movie Great action Great dino effects Slow start as to having to bring everything together But I ce you get through that very enjoyable I gave  stars due to the slow start,Notr
Trite formulaic tosh Its so bad Ive downloaded this app and created an account just so I can review it I enjoyed the other movies although none had the magic of the first but this is almost as though the writers couldnt be bothered  Or all the budget went on getting all the original actors back Such a waste and dont get me started on the number of times a massive predator was able to take to creep up and take the cast by surprise were they genetically modified to tip toe Im annoyed with this movie I was looking forward to seeing it and basically after the first hour I became so apathetic I decided to spring clean my email accounts while the film dragged on to its end,Notr
Despite its attempt at renewing the sequence of events that gets these Dino experts on the wrong side of the fence plot has a strange aimlessness to it Commercialisation of the Isla Nublars live stock might have been a good card to play or at least a militarisation gone wrong would have succeeded as a spinoff Also theres certainly a good amount of documenting the magnificent giants but some bits dont really add up a significant value to the succession These end up carving craters in which the hype gets lost All this clumsiness directs at the lack of originality to the story a common singular nemesis this time even without known origins and ending up exactly the same way as indominus is more like a gut punch to the hopeful viewer Dominion may age soon despite being the flashy new instalment but for all its carefully arranged encounters of new kinds its worth a watch,Notr
Dont think there are any good things to say about this pile of I loved the first Jurassic park even the next two were watchable the World films started quite decent nd OK if daft But this is just an excuse to make money Theres no story its just like some execs have just said Hmmm We could probably quite easily make a few hundred million without any effort just throw some dinosaurs on screen crappy special effects and dont worry about storyThe special effects at times are laughable Theres one in the opening sequence where a dinosaurs is next to a train Seriously looks like a Dr Who effect from  Really really badSo my advise is watch Jurassic Park even the first Jurassic world dont bother with thisIts embarrassing,Notr
Slow introduction but when it gets going it takes off Lots of callbacks to previous films I loved it It aint Hamlet Its a big dumb monster movie Sir back and enjoy,Notr
I never really got the Jurassic Park thing This was sort of a way to tie it into modern genetics and give us a bunch of famous actors But there was so much pointless dinosaur violence that just stopped being suspenseful And another trope of the big bad corporation that was so predictable the whole time Throw in a black lady with attitude and it just seems like the goal was less telling a story and more appealing to constituents And people are right  hours is way too long for this simple story when nothing of significance warranted itI think the final problem form me was the now common story element telling us our elected government officials can or will take care of a major problem such as corporate malfeasance Yeah right Pretty amazing cynicism in this day and age,Notr
I generally do not write reviews but this movie was worst I have seen in recent timesScreenplay was like loose motionActors were like randomly called to do shots and go away no link in what they want to achieveSeems they just wanted to bring all the character and do birthday celebration,Notr
Same old cat and mouse play between our heroes and dinosaurs Doest matter where exactly it can be a facility park island whateverIf you are a bad guy dinosaurs will attack you and catch right away but if you are from the main cast group they will circle around you for hoursSo story and writing havent been able to develop at all Same formulaCasting and acting was only for nostalgia Yes it was nice too see old and young generation together but they didnt have a good story to bound them So it was just based on nostalgia feeling movieAnd of course every jurassic park have to have a trex fight in the end but this time we couldnt even pick a side because even they didnt have any story to back up withHow did this movie reach almost to a B beyond me but nowadays just make a movie with name and marketing so mindless audience floods you money anyway No more creativity just milking the project,Notr
It was nice to see the ob cast return the Dinos and cgi were beautiful and the action was great all in all a great experience Dont understand the bad critics I mean what did u expect its a dinosaur Movie,Notr
Most people commenting havent even seen the movie and are just trying to give it a bad rating Theyre called trollsI havent seen the movie yet so I cant give it a review However theres no debate its better than Fallen Kingdom that was a disaster,Notr
It was so bad that my wife came out of the theater in a really bad mood and we had a fight because of the bad tension Two hours full of action but still superficial and empty,Notr
Jurassic World Dominion is better then Fallen Kingdom and better then Jurassic Park  and  but its not as good as Jurassic Park or Jurassic World I loved majority of the movie I had a few problems with it but mostly it was an enjoyable movie,Notr
Apparently nearly  years from the release of the original Jurassic Park film sees the complete unneeded return of Laura Dern Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum The problem with this film is not its special effects but the story feels bland and generic and very lifeless The inclusion of those three elder actors simply took away screen time from the main focus characters Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard dont feel nearly as important to the core story as they did in the previous two films in the seriesThe film also feels rather watered down and tame The dinosaurs are menacing but we barely see anything of note The end was entirely predictable as we wanted the film to come to an end,Notr
I wont go into details this movie was incredibely underwhelming and the plot is terrible There are some good cinematic shots and the old jp crew is back this is all I can say positively Every part of the movie is just a huge miss and zero satisfaction I wont spoil it but lets just say the Giga scenes are terrible literally acts like its blind or just doesnt know what he wants to do,Notr
Its another woke movie full of non sense just to tick boxes and make certain people happy otherwise they gonna cry like babiesDownvote to oblivion and boycott every woke movietv show out there,Notr
Jokes aside this was a movie that was really curious for me The idea was fantastic trying to find an equilibrium with dinosaurs after the genie is out of the bottle However the execution was really choppy each scene was as unbelievable as the next and that has to be the fault of Colin the director It makes me miss the first Jurassic World movie which I thought was the weakest but he executed it already well thereMaybe its time constraint or stuff but I appreciate the effort by everyone involved Its a good ending but really could have been a blockbuster and it probably would in the box office but not a blockbuster that Jurassic  and  were or even Fallen Kingdom,Notr
I love all the jurassic films with a negative here and there on them but this one i just have more negative views than positive ones it was nice to see the original cast back good couple of scary scenes but other than that i didnt enjoy this film,Notr
But omg this has to be the worst movie that has come out so far in  Baring the CGI which was pretty good and the only reason its not  star everything was off The story was bland the bad guy was so generic with no motive apart from control it was laughable the acting was wooden the plot holes were massive i could go on but theres no point Give it a miss and let the franchise die its already far too slow and painful death They should have left it at Jurassic World as a  off callback then called it a day,Notr
Im not going to spend too much time on this movie review because it doesnt deserve it Over complicated boring and a complete waste of time Chris Pratt who I do like is awful along with Dallas Howard Please let the Jurassic franchise fade into extinction,Notr
The viewing pleasure of the movie was high but one of the most important things that should be in most movies was very weak the music It would not be wrong if I say that a movie with weak music is doomed to be bad The action and chase scenes were really weak due to the music they didnt even need to put music in some scenes this really upset me Another issue is the bad character even though our bad character seems like a coldblooded person it was a little weak in my opinion and the ending was a clich I couldnt see any problems in the visual effects but the dinosaur fight in the final scene didnt interest me and I couldnt get excited Again the happy ending event in the final scene was really boring to me My rating for the movie is  ,Notr
Despite some of the harsh reviews this is a good movie It might not be what everyone is expecting especially from the short teaservideo that dropped before Christmas but as an adventure movie with dinosaurs it delivered Also its not a horror film either its a family film With all that in mind the cast do a fantastic job and the effects are faultless Sound editing is intense in all the action scenes score is good too The old and new cast work well together and have great chemistry Jeff delivers some awesome lines in his unique style I didnt know there was a code and many others Bryce is wonderful in every scene and her character has become super likeable compared to the first Worlds film DeWanda is incredible a sassy and interesting new character that steals her scenes Also its a movie about the dangers of genetic modification coexistence and ecology too a point that seems to be lost on many viewers Go see it,Notr
The screen was cropped due to the aspect ratio I saw it in PVR India  not IMAXWell it starts from where they left in  The dinosaurs are living among the public throughout the world Making a place for themselves in the eco systemThey have a huge star cast especially from the Jurassic park franchiseIts one time watch with a predictable storyline and awful dialoguesYou must go with your lil oneskids or there is no adventure in it,Notr
Dominion is everything wrong about the other bad sequels but triple down to make the worst film of the franchise The writing is pathetic filled with annoying remember this moments coincidences and plot holes galore and not focusing on dinosaurs on earth and instead recycles ideas from the other movies the character are paper thin either plot device or fan service the visuals are absolute garbage the editing is confusing and all over the place the action is dull terribly done and no tension because everyone is invincible the acting is phoned in the music is a poor John Williams imitator the dinosaurs are an afterthought the movie never addresses the Dinos on earth concept and the ending is one big middle finger to the fans Spielberg and the franchise itself Dont watch it for any reason Stay with the first film Hopefully this can finally make this franchise go extinct,Notr
Typical storyline of jurassic world Vfx are also not amazing But superb mind blowing audio work with the superb clarity of dolby atmos mixing But still the first jurassic park movie is better than this The dinosaurs are very realistic though it was  This is not up to the level but nice and treat to watch Definitely watch in a theatre Otherwise useless,Notr
Being fan of Jurassic parts series as worth to see such movies on big screen and with audio setup i was the most disappointed person perhaps on earth with this episode of so called JP dominion It was the most boring and lengthy jurassic ride ever as many a times it put me on sleep I was shocked that they have shown that all dinosaurs are blind and that these tiny helpless humans are in just  feet away in front of them and they cannot see them and so they cannot eat them just beacuse they are main characters How stupid Directors and producers did a terrible job acting was totally an overacting and it was as usual and nothing new there except some pretty faces  was CG so just watch it as you are jurassic park fan otherwise you wont miss anything if you miss to watch it,Notr
Greetings from LithuaniaJurassic World Dominion  is not going to win any awards for screenplay but actors might win for keeping their straight faces during its whole  h  min runtime They all did admirable jobs but its the Laura Dern which proved why she is the Oscar winner  in role of nothing she was in for every scene silly as they were Directing was solid for the material because at its long running time i was entertained and it wasnt boring as previous movie was And to be honest i do watch Jurassic movies because not of their screenplay of plot  they are all silly escapism movies including the first one On that account Dominion did its job,Notr
This film is a train wreck Though it is loaded with a great cast of actors all the performances seem like rehearsals Even Chris Pratt seems to be sleepwalking through this The script is a big mess The direction is lifeless and aimless Bryce Howard is dreadful She always bugs me Other than having beautiful red hair and being Ron Howards daughter its amazing to me that she has a career She really cannot play a convincing character She has the same expression whether being chased by dinosaurs or in romantic scenes with Chris PrattJeff Goldblum is in this for two short scenes and hes the only convincing actor in thisThere is a beautiful D animation at the end with two dinosaurs in a lake at sunset Im giving  stars for the animation,Notr
Agent smith says things like OMG and robot sentinels give fist bumps now Though failing to capture the magic of the first movie I could appreciate the other sequels for trying to expand the universe and keeping the same tone This one purposely makes a mockery of itself and calls it self awareness Ill stick with watching the first one only for now on,Notr
If you know the original trilogy leave it at that and leave this movie alone It is a self devouring serpent from the moment it startsIn a word S L I M YSave your money and your sanity,Notr
Ive been waiting for this one with anticipation and I was thoroughly disappointed I spent the first  minutes wondering what was going on It was barely coherent The rest of the movie got slightly better But there was no real story Some parts were enjoyable Some werent But at the end I didnt feel like my day had been enriched by watching it and I have no desire to watch it again The original Matrix on the other hand I still watch that at least once a year This movie was done strictly as a money grab There was no real story to tell and no journey to follow I dont recommend it,Notr
If the SyFy channel made a Matrix series it would look like this So much about this is way off The editing and pacing Shot composition Fight scenes Lighting All of it looks cheap and nasty and thats just the st  mins,Notr
This movie looses the magic of The Matrix Everybody whos seen the previous three Matrix movies will be very disappointed Everyone expects something similar to the famous bullet doge or Neo vs Smith or even the final fight in the rain But the movie delivers none of that Every fight scene is full of fakelooking CGI neither Neo nor Trinity really does any physical fighting Instead they just use their Matrix powers You cant feel any impact during fight scenes The majority of epic sequences are already in the trailer The tone and pacing feel weird and theres very little chemistry between some of the new characters The movie also has a lot of dull conversation while attempting to bring back nostalgia This movie is overly reliant on the previous movies There would be a reference to the trilogy once in a while sometimes there will even be a scene directly from the trilogy The whole movie just feels lazy The only good sequence is towards the finale when Neo and Trinity are motorcycling through the city,Notr
It was so bad that I dont have words to discribe it Never watch if you dont want to compromise your memory about old MatrixEvery single moment is stupid and not logical,Notr
Truly unbelievable they had the nerve to release this They reenact the majority of scenes from the trilogy primarily the original movie and also physically show footage of the original numerous times Pathetic it really is pathetic Im tired of this repetitive mediocre garbage with seemingly every new movie of the past  or so years the lack of effort and quality is beyond sad I barely go to the cinema anymore as of a few years ago due to total nonsense being on and I think this was my last cinema visit ever unless I can be sure its even remotely worth the money,Notr
Looks like Lana Wachowski decided to take a backseat and let a fanboy take the entire movie Thats how the whole movie was I cringed so hard at the self References that they make throughout the movie Till this movie  I thought that Keanu and Carrie Ann Moss were the backbones of this movie but now  I realised that it is Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving who carried it The action sequences were not fluid as in the first movie Plot wise I felt that this was better than Revolutions but the making was so bland Easily the worst movie in The Matrix franchise,Notr
The original Matrix is an absolute classic  The two sequels were good  or  but with pretty confusing storylines in partsThis film is truly dreadful Surprisingly awful in factThe trailor takes tiny snapshots of the film and make it look like a fantastic blockbuster but in reality it is a nostalgiaheavy poorly thought out and terribly acted remake of sorts of the first filmThe storyline and the number of pointless easter eggsrepeats of the first film make this a largely pointless addition to the original trilogySave your money or go and see Spiderman instead ,Notr
You talk about the first movie thats fine But these little clips showing us are utterly terrible And they just kept going and goingSo I gave up after  minutes but then I just had to know what happens in the movie so i watched the rest And its not bad Its good actually Just some things still make no sense Like the clips from the first movie are in all the wrong places We know all the stuff they show us but we dont know what they didnt show us Like who is that group of homeless people Why no flashback here when it would have made senseAlso not having Hugo Play agent smith really lowers the movie by a huge margin Not having morpheus is explained because of the time gap But no Hugo was the worst part about this movie,Notr
A large portion of The Matrix Resurrections is about digging into the memories of not only Thomas Anderson but the audience who watched these movies  years ago While the flirtation with nostalgia is interesting the commentary on the entertainment industry in general is a little too obvious for a world that is already elbows deep within itThe core of this movie is what really matters and thats Neo and Trinity The progression of their story makes absolute sense when taking the entire franchise into context and ultimately gives us a Matrix movie that is far more personal than weve had before They are not pushed aside to prop up newer characters and when I walked out of the theater I was not thinking about the action or special effects but instead the beautiful relationship between two human beings that reminds us what true love is all about,Notr
Morpheus was a smart profound man who left the impression of a kung fu monk This new one is an antipathetic character that I wouldnt follow anywhere even if my own life depends on itThese new characters they did dont inspire and dont have that intellectual depth The only thing good about this film are the moments of fights CGI and of course its nice to see Niobe Trinity and NeoHowever when you get to The Merovingian Lambert Wilson speech or to The Analyst Patrick Haris you come back to IMDB and edit your rating from terrible to hm okHaha D The song from credits My God this modernday society killed everything This is embarrassing,Notr
This film is bold and for that Ive given it bonus points Its part romance part violence and quite a bit of fillerThe film reminds me of a art house project with a big budget It feels fragmented as it switches between a romancedrama and hardcore action flick I found myself being bored by the characters  not caring about them or their plight They added nothing to the storyIf I had to describe what was fun it was revisiting the first Matrix film it was seeing a fan fiction film made by a wachowsky It was seeing Neo and Trinity engaging each other I also enjoyed Neil Patrick Harris with some of his dialogue  he was spot on at timesOverall its an OK film Its too different from the original It lacks thought provoking The action scenes feel flat The characters dont do much The motives are not strongId give it a go Support the gamble taken in making this film its genuinely different Just think romance with martial arts and it might helpContains at least one graphic scene Not recommended for squirmish teens,Notr
Like most the original Matrix blew my mind when I saw it in the theaters I dont think there will ever be another movie that will have the same effect on me and truly being genre defining So its silly to expect it from Matrix Resurrections They were never shy acknowledging this was in big part fan service and honestly they did well on that end They also managed to make a decent story have good action scenes and get the actors to give it their best shot Again it doesnt compare to the original but its good enough to make you forget Reloaded and Revolutions and just for that its a great movie in my book,Notr
SHOCKING  years and this is the best they can come up with Another awful remake the characters are a shadow of what they once where The storyline had so potential to work with and they created this garbage Absolute disgrace to the original trilogy these modern day writers and film producers should be ashamed what theyve done here,Notr
Laughingly bad Filled with loads of Remember this flashbacks and obnoxious slowmo and blur Dull and confusing story dumb dialogue and crap action sequences you wont remember at all Another rehash stinker Just a quick cashgrab and all the talent from the original Matrix trilogy is gone and left with a movie that wasnt needed in the first place,Notr
Ok let me start saying this is not an all bad movie but it doesnt feel any like the previous Matrix franchise Not the acting not the script not the enviroment nothing seems really in the right spot And one of the bigger problems if not the biggest Keanu is not Neo anymore there is zero percent chance you see him and not relate him to John Wick,Notr
It helped me set a low bar and mediocre expectations for this movie so after I saw it and was both thrilled and inspired by its raw and deeper and practical message I had no option but to give it a  So thank you,Notr
I just cant understand why this movie was made into this versionI waited so very long for Neo to return but not like thisMovie feels wayward Had so much potential but why the wachowski did not put much needed effort in furthering the one of the most amazing franchise of all timesLike i said WAYWARD,Notr
Blah blah blah  how much talking and exposition is in this movie The original matrix had a lot of talking too but every conversation is intriguing In this movie it bored me to death Almost put me to sleepBlah blah blah  the mess of a story that is this movie Its all over the place and feels like a bunch of nonsense mashed togetherBlah blah blah  the unclear and uninspiring action The fight scenes in the first two movie are amongst the best ever put to screen including Asian cinema The action in Reloaded is incredible In this movie it just feels like action vomit all over the screen It ranges from mediocre to bad And only one part is memorable certain things are falling onto the street The fight scenes suffer from close ups and quick cuts something we never see in the originalsThe more I think about it a  star rating seems generous But thats how I felt leaving the theater There is some good here But I dont think Id bother giving it another chance  viewing ,Notr
Movie provides a new metanarrative that unravels a new type of story telling  something new You have to watch M multiple times to understand the story I agree it was not heavily martialartsoriented but had more emotionalvibrational fights Great movie,Notr
Story is okay But they forgot about actionEven Matrix became generic popcorn movie these days Nothing to remember Nothing new Nothing fresh If youre fan of the franchise you should see it cause there is hope universe will be extended and someday something good maybe came out of it If you didnt saw the original trilogy  nothing for you here,Notr
Rewatch it and I think youll get it more a lot of stuff left out but theres a reason I think there will be a new trilogy to explain the rest The last one titled the matrix resolutions,Notr

"Why did the stars from the first want to even scrape the surface for this horrible movie This absolutely tarnishes the matrix trilogy Please
Hollywood Stop doing this This movie is abhorentWatching this was just a collage of retakes from the original movie and nothing was original compared to the trilogy and the ideas that made the matrix so good Please stop remaking these awesome movies Did we learn from the horrible remake of point break Arent there any original stories anymore Hollywood This is why we dont go to movies any longer Stop going for the cheap buck Give us an original film for once",Notr
Back then the first Matrix movie was a revelation for sure one of the best movies made in the s I also liked the sequels a lot  despite some flaws here and there Anyway The Matrix Resurrections is what I expected and feared  a very mediocre movie compared to the original trilogy Who needs this one Why was it even made  the story was told and Resurrections adds nothing really new or any good Like that new Resident Evil fail this one I watched once and I will most likely never put on a screen again I will take the blue pill and forget its existence,Notr
After watching the film I was disappointed It really turned out to be a halfsequel halfremake of the original film  that is the main story is almost the same as in the first part even some scenes are copied almost frame by frame only some details are changed and new characters are added which cannot be compared with the old onesThe original Matrix still looks better and passes the test of time it is better to revise it well the whole trilogy at the same time,Notr
Overall the movie is pretty good It starts slow however but then it picks up and shows off some really good action So the pacing does suffer in the first halfChemistry between NeoTrinityMorpheus is certainly there and the movie has a ton of throwbacks to previous parts It cohesively fits into the franchise and production quality is top notch However the ending was quite a disappointment The movie lacked a strong villain and that shows toward the endYou definitely should watch it if you love previous movies,Notr
I had a horrible feeling  minutes into the film it was going to be bad The film is very off No Morpheus no Matrix and what is with the incessant need to show clips from the original film every minute like we dont know what they are referring toIt feels like they made this to a younger audience who have never heard of The Matrix and needed reminding with the constant references to the firstI feel sick,Notr
The first act is a clever and tightly edited setup that does a great job at hinting that there is a larger idea behind this movie an idea about the state of the world post trilogy that needs Neo to returnThen the movie hits an almost literal wall It just stops People start expositing a lot and its awkward obtuse dialog too often in complete silence like a homemade movie without a score Characters act but with the exception of Neo we dont understand why Interesting developments about the posttrilogy world are introduced but just as quickly as theyre mentioned they cease to matter From this point forward good guys are good because theyre good bad guys are bad because theyre bad and they play their parts like hollow automata around Neo trying to reach TrinityThis transition between the first act and the rest of the movie is black and white A real pity,Notr
The three previous Matrix you could sense the fear the humans had when entering the Matrix or interactions with the machines These new characters treated it like it was their neighborhood playground and had no worries of death It was laughable I said characters because I actually dont even remember none of their names,Notr
I had the impression I was watching a fusion of Sense and Matrix the atmosphere the music reminded me of the series and the acting was ok not worth a movie like The Matrix Disappointed I wish I could unseen what I saw,Notr
I am a huge Matrix fan and apart from the original they all have their flaws but this one has the smarts and fear that the original has The Matrix makes you wonder if we are in a computer generated world and if our life isnt real In this one it makes you believe it more with the way the world is filled with hate and are we being controlled to fear each other by being under a higher power The story is amazingly connected with the original  it has the action the power of love with Neo and Trinity it does have the Nostalgia but new at the same time I was very impressed but Im also a bigger fan of Resurrected than I am of Reloaded and I know that one was also frowned upon Sit back relax and enjoy having this franchise back as much as I am,Notr
This movie is completely unnecessary to the Matrix world as sometimes it doesnt even feel like a Matrix movie If not for the many original trilogy flashbacks sometimes I though I was seeing some king of John Wick  or any other scifiaction movie with Keanu Reeves His performance is forgetable and sometimes looks like hes parodying himelf The rest of the cast never got my attention neither the story and I have to be honest I felt the story to be so bad and uninteresting that I had to use my smartphone a lot to avoid sleepingIm not saying you shouldnt watch the movie but be ready for nothing like the original trylogy in any item you can rate a movie Not even the fight scenes are good as they are badly choreographed and filmed and the special effect are just the same as any other  movie Nothing special hereI had low expectations but this is even worse then I was prepared to,Notr
Were in a world where original stories have the hardest journey to the screen it takes hundreds and hundred of people doing their best to get the job done so we dont have to watch another remake of a remake And with a stroke of the keyboard so many will dismissively rate it just  star to make a point that theyre butt hurt Seriously We should be thankful we get to go back to The Matrix at all and enjoy the ride not be so arrogant to dismiss it with the rating of a reprehensible unwatchable pile of garbage Its cruel unnecessary and not even vaguely true Get a life  or better yet  let average people just like you rate YOUR masterpiece I dont think youd like that now would you,Notr
I gave this a  because there is more I liked than I didnt I felt like the progression of the story was slow and they did spend a lot of time remaking old nostalgic scenes from the past I did like a lot of the new things they added although nothing felt groundbreaking about it Yet Im still so torn because I loved it I felt similar to when I watched the original trilogy it gave you a lot to think about I want to watch it again because I feel like this is something I need to absorb at least twice,Notr
Ive had it with these pointless soft reboots Its like Terminator Genisys crossed with A Good Day to Die Hard in terms of sequel style except way way worse It thoroughly destroys the entire Matrix legacy so efficiently in fact that it seems like a parody that is trying to do exactly that It has no soul no point no logic nothing I even hated every single action sequence It was so repulsive I had to look at memes on half a screen to lessen the pain enough to finish the film Turns out there wasnt a single enjoyable second there to find yet I still feel brave for having watched it all the way making it the single worst movie Ive ever finished Easily the greatest disappointment in film history Therefore this movie is an inspiration for fan made Matrix short films and reloadedrevolutions edits Only watch this film if youre being paid good money to do so,Notr
Story Fourth part from Matrix Neo in machine world is game designer who has given world  games The games are the previous  parts of matrix Now they are again on the discovery to know the truth and fulfill whats missingCinematography The cinematography achieved during first  movies was of ace quality This part doesnt make it look fadingDirection I expected more so I would say it was an average effort from director LanaFinal Verdict I have always been great fan of Matrix trilogy It were kind of based on some Indian philosophies When the trailer first came out what came to my mind was concept of rebirth where Neo  Trinity are in Matrix and Zion is free To add further Zion is free to free for those who want to be freed A movie developed over such story would have been aced moreThis is where I say the effort as average The story puts love of Trinity and Neo first This is where it becomes easy to developI am happy that movie is available to stream on internet without letting someone wait So guys enjoy and spread positive word,Notr
Every piece of dialogue is like a youtube comedy sketch the fights look terrible and the ending scene is probably the worst thing I have ever witnessed in a movie,Notr
Wow more than  and a half hours of pointless dialogue with zero comepelling conflict no antagonist no point no emotion no decent action scenes and absolutely no character developmentHow a movie gets made when the script is this bad is astounding,Notr
I didnt rated matrix  because i will not give a good score and i dont want to underrated it in respect of matrix trilogy beforeYeah they ruined even our earlier understanding of matrix how it works but what really made me upset was bringing those actors with childish silly role dancing acting like Morfeous role and silly color,Notr
As soon as I saw the title I knew this cant be good Lol of course Keanu being one of my favorite actors I was going to watch this movie no matter how awful and boring it was Yes its not a good movie and yes the story line is pretty much boring and really anything particular to care for The characters are very shallow and you really dont care for any of them But again if they make another one Id probably watch,Notr
I pride myself on being nuanced I honestly believe everything has its weak and strong points But not this abomination of a filmThe story itself is unbelievably hollow and they filled that void with shameless recycling of the Matrix trilogy and constant empty repetitive dialogues between forgettable characters Everything else to the story was random farfetched and confusing It almost felt like a movie made by a youtuber with some Keanu Reeves cameos They not only did injustice to the trilogy the characters actually mocked it openly with the tons of sarcasm in referral to the first Matrix moviesZero love and talent went into this The most obvious cashgrab I haver ever seen  they have no shame I still cant believe it First review ever just to fulminate and ventGo watch it Do it See for yourself how low a director can stoop,Notr
This is not the next huge chapter in The Matrix saga However its very enjoyable return that has some meta fun with itselfIf you you love this world and have a yearning for seeing Neo and Trinity again youll have a good time Just dont go in looking for more than that,Notr
Remember how every Star Wars nerd reacted when the prequels came out how the second trilogy was lamented for not standing up to the originalsThe difference between those and Resurrections is that over time the second Star Wars trilogy aged like a fine wine and can be appreciated for what it is and can stand on its own three feetResurrections is hot garbage Cringeinducing throwbacks poor film quality bad cliches and a nonexistent story The fight scenes are dumb the climaxes nonclimaxial nothing engaging or thought provoking at all Characters are entirely forgettableIts like a group of people who had never seen The Matrix decided they needed to make another one Like Disney bought the rights and just completely rainbowpuked on an otherwise excellent universeIts bad Great for laughing at how bad it is but its bad,Notr
But it surprised me that this isnt that If you get stuck on the nostalgia immediately and write this movie off just like any modern rehashmovie i think youre doing yourself a misserviceSure the action is not great and too messyThe acting is for the most part not great eitherBut theres something or alot of things different in this movie More information more open to interpretation than perhaps even the original Matrix Im not comparing just saying that this is different and it leaves me wanting to understand more Plus it flips a finger not only to like everything but also to itself which i feel is kinda fresh If you dont get that well i guess youll have to grow older ,Notr
This movie looks nothing like the originals although the plot is somewhat funny which means that both cinematography and script are nothing like the original matrix trilogy,Notr
Utter rubbish In the first few minutes I already knew that this movie would disrespect and soil the Matrix legacy and frankly the last one really toed the lineGarbage plot garbage directing no Morpheus garbage effects Felt cheaply done What were they thinking This movie has no business bearing the The Matrix moniker The ending alone should have made someone stop and ask is this dumb af or is it just meBottom line We deserved better than thisKeanu if you read this I hope you know that Im still a huge fan Your acting was terrible but I forgive you,Notr
Im still not really sure what I watched I feel like nothing really happened in this filmFor a  hour film there shouldve been more of a climax or resolution Its very light on action and the action that does transpire is lackluster to say the leastI enjoyed the start of the film excluding the unnecessary retread of the original films opening The White Rabbit sequence and everything with Neo questioning his existence was compelling The meta commentary was okay at first but seemed really out of place the more they hammered it home The constant flashbacks to the original were weird and just reminded me that I couldve been watching a better Matrix filmKeanu is as watchable as ever and the relationship with Trinity is solid stuff I enjoyed Groff and NPH quite a bit in their roles The recasting thing was odd and the explanation is pretty weak but the actors did as well as they could having to live up to some iconic performances Im not a massive fan of the franchise but I still expected something more from this film than empty nostalgia,Notr
I think that a huge part of humanity lost its grace depth and strength I dont know why Something changedThe Matrix Resurrections feels like people just had some fun doing this stuff acting etc Feels like old friends gathered to see each other and to make some money if possibleThere are some crucial new ideas as a continuation of the story I appreciate that new meaning but it feels like this movie could have been done much better In some waysProbably this movie is an answer to those studios that own rights on intellectual properties Its an answer to those studios that probably want to make money by exploiting the sacred and dear art pieces of old daysMany are shortsighted these days Will it come to a world war once Will there be a cleaning of too shortsighted errors of nature or we will be just passively fading away until its too late Maybe Im too shortsighted to see the value of The Matrix ResurrectionsThanks for the efforts anyway,Notr
"Im writing this while Im watching it for the th time in  days
Each time I watched it  I had a different opinion  Remember when you watched the first Matrix 
maybe it was the sameFirst I was too excited too afraid of disappointment Too anxious to have a new experience of life time for the second time after the first original partThen when I saw how its going For the first hour I felt a mixture between shock disappointment Admiration for the boldness of the approach Excitement about the massive impact of that new bold approach for such an iconic movieThen I started to think like the director What the   Did she meant to do I got to a point That it wasnt just a sequel to the original  It was an exquisite way to make a statement of creativity Now I felt like an associate on the experience 
She meant to make me an accomplice at the new crime against the ordinary status quoNow I feel that while the first part was an eye opener This part is a heart opener by all means",Notr
Neo and Trinity were fine they had no issues in holding the originality of the first three movies but when prime actors like Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne are replaced with inexperienced actors the theatrical attractions is destroyed Its rather obvious that this is propaganda when key words like sheeple are used This movie was a let down in accordance with current degradation of society,Notr
"They turned a classic movie into a laughable mess
I truly have no commentThe script was rushed the continuity was badThe action scenes had no substance
I have to addWhy was this even made",Notr
No seriously wheres the iconic Matrix actionIts  and there was better cgi action in This feels more of a knock off than an actual movie inspired from the concepts of the previous filmsMuch disappointment,Notr

Good meta elements
Very bad action

I actually found the trailers before the film more excitingHow to take a great franchise and completely ruin it I own the other  dvds and watch them often this pile of rubbish i will never watch again,Notr
They look like a Kpop band they turned morpheus ne into an old idiot and the fight scenes are worthy of the s What they did with this movie was a crime,Notr
Poor in many ways acting effects dialogue fights story and the trashy music I managed to get to the end Nothing like the perfection of the original A mixed up confusing mess that only kids would enjoy,Notr
This movie was an okay film but it that great like the first original movie Dont get me wrong The Matrix is still a true classic compared to Keanu Reeves and CarrieAnne Moss performance from there previous films over the years after But for this year they still nailed there part as Neo and Trinity Even tho there getting a little older as you think Lana Wachowski involved with the fourth installment and tries to connect the story of how Neo and Trinity got resurrected and clearly not the exact story of what we think it is at some point Some people still enjoys the Matrix and some people are quite disappointed but Im not gonna give anything away,Notr
Put all expectations aside and try watching this movie without speculation beyond what you were hoping it might be nothing short of spectacular and you will find that it almost lives up to the hype that almost made it invigoratinly brilliant  But of course every critic will have their own input on to how things could have been better,Notr
A shell of a story filled with many iconic scenes from The Matrix past and even more holes I have mixed feelings The Matrix Resurrections was nostalgic kinda but the characters and story peek so far below the threshold set by the first Matrix movie that I was left disappointed The movie feels like an attempt to squeeze a few more  out of an iconic franchise Dont be surprised if this is the start of second trilogy,Notr
What all the people trashing this umpteenth copy of a copy are forgetting is that it doesnt matter what you all think about the product All that matters is that you paid for it The people in this industry have incredibly lavish lifestyles to maintain Your  is merely th of a tank of petrol to take the lambo out for an afternoon joyride So suck it up buttercup and keep shelling out to check out photocopy  of INSERT MCU UNIVERSE SPINOFF here so that the industry suits can lord it over your sad little lives Those private jets dont fly themselvesThe movie starts out excellently then descends into wtf territory by suffering from a lack of tight editing of unnecessary scenessequences and story elements Couldve been a contender instead of a mostly forgettable addition to the series,Notr
First  foremost they should have left this trilogy well alone As it progressively got worst from the original to revelations But ultimately was a good trilogy and a great originalNow what the  Is this mess That basiclly throws half of the old film in  copies the other half with much much poorer actors as is the nature of this very unoriginal and unimpressive shambles Acting was badddd Script was beyond a joke made by an A hole  Considering its predecessor its patheticI wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless I hated them,Notr
I watched it twice as I think every Matrix fan shouldThe first time was in an IMAX theater and I enjoyed it Action scenes were good storyline was good but Im not real sure I was fully following it I left with some questions as to why certain things were done in the ways that they were I had read some reviews before seeing it that first time and I disagreed with some of those reviews and agreed with others but all and all I had enjoyed it enough I then watched it again on HBO MAX and thats when I really enjoyed it I had more of a grasp on the story line and a lot of those questions I had after the first showing were no long there and this were making themselves more clear and I disagreed with a lot more of the not so good reviews Its a fun movie with a smart storyline Im welcoming to another if they chose to do another one Im sure Ill see it a few more times and throw it in the mix throughout the years when revisiting the Matrix,Notr

Its okay they definitely didnt ruin it but it definitely didnt live up to the hype The fight scenes were nowhere near as epic as the others and the ending was awful but its worth a watch I grew up with the matrix movies and have always been a big fan but they just missed the mark If youve never seen the other movies youll probably really enjoy it and prior knowledge isnt really needed,Notr
"Pros
 The story expansion is remarkable The human real world details are based on current discussions about future From that aspect it is really very contemporary The new state of machinehuman interaction is very very futuristic The text and conversations that including programming terms and computer science are at a quite high levelCons
 There are too much new details and flow is too fast Many details are being covered so fastly and slightly because of movie length despite it is too long That is why i couldnt understand clearly and feel to rewind at many points This film absolutely should be  part One  hour film is not enough to cover everything Fight scenes are not at an enough level Both from amount and content aspects KungFu scenes are not enough attractive and artistic Keanu Reeves was much more serial at Reloded and Revolution Tension is absolutely the most absent thing in this film in comparison with trilogy The flow is going on a plain level Level of energy is low generally",Notr
It is clear that neither keanu nor lana wanted to this this movie and the result is far below expectations or what could have been a masterpiece of the decade Warner should have taken care of matrix legacy before releasing this official cutIf you are a fan of Matrix and though this would be mindblowing as of the original this is surely the disappointment and indeed will never again be accomplishedBut if you want a fresh restart of a new saga hopefully this could become something big in a new trilogy Just need warner to take care of plot director actors special effects and edition basically evertyhing,Notr

I am one of those who grew up in the matrix generation I have watched the original films countless times as well as the animatrix and I rewatched everything in anticipation for this newest instalmentI had my doubts when I first heard they were making another Matrix and was intrigued as to how Neo and Trinity would return After watching this newest instalment I dont understand the widespread negativity towards the film It is done in a unique way which is not cheesy or expected and the plot is different enough from the original films that it feels fresh while still keeping the aesthetics that the fans loveMy only issues with the film was that it had way too many flashback scenes of the previous film and the beginning set up took up most of the movie and then the end felt rushed Overall though I think if you were a fan of the original films you will enjoy this for what it is,Notr
A good number of professional movie critics are not fully honest fearful of burning bridges with those in the industry But this time a larger number have even had a hard time stomaching their disgust for this lazy bloated boring tribute to itselfIn a nutshell this is what happens when a concept should have ended earlier becomes a trilogy that should have nailes the coffin shut and they decide they still want to cash in on an easy reboot of the same intellectual property they own Its so convoluted that it must be explained to the viewer in great detail as if a board room pitch with the questions So sis it all make sense What do you thinkThe answers are no and sets a new low on useless sequels that at least could have been  minutes to minimize the waste of time Its hard to go back to the original with a straight face after having seen this,Notr
Quite frankly I dont see how this got bad reviews Im actually quite shocked In my opinion the bad reviews come from people who never understood the first  I was entertained and engaged the entire time,Notr
Matrix lV heavily relies on nostalgia from the first Matrix Except this sequel almost makes a spoof or parody of the original at the beginning Then all is revealedJust because theres lots of callbacks to the original doesnt make this sequel on par In fact it just shows what a masterpiece the first one was Its effects including the iconic bullet time was unrivaled and is still amazing today Resurrections uses CGI to complete a lot of their action sequences but its nothing groundbreaking like it was beforeReeves and Moss fall into their characters of old without missing a beat Newcomers to the franchise Neil Patrick Harris and Jessica Henwick were also good New Morpheus edition was interesting Smith replacement thats a tall order and unfortunately the character is just not the same without WeavingIm not exactly sure where this one lies among the other two sequels Reloaded is probably better but the three sequels are all about the same for me They all have their own pros and cons,Notr
What the frick did we just watch I actually wanted to turn it off after  minutes but figured its free on HBO so might as well finish it Even at free it was BAD it wasnt even a bad b title Reeves just breezed through it showed no emotion no decent fight scenes nothing improved over the  year wait His John Wick movies are all awesome you always get phenomenal action phenomenal fights and a decent story This was bad in every possible way Oh and it just shows YOU NEEDED HUGO WEAVING He didnt get enough credit for the matrix movies And Neil Patrick Harris as a VillianIN A MATRIX FILM WHAT Wow what a complete let down this train wreck was shame on you reeves Now Im worried about John Wick ,Notr
I thought it would never end Tedious and boring Such a shame I think perhaps they should stop making any movies in this series I lost interest very quickly,Notr

This movie is not The Matrix This movie is very similar to The Last Jedi The used the same title They used some of the same characters the soundtrack is completely different the score is completely different the color pallet is completely different the timing is completely different the pacing is completely different  the cinematography is completely different there is virtually zero martial arts choreography  It is a completely different movie and you can feel it as soon as the opening credits end,Notr
"I guess the main reason why I didnt really liked it was the fact that Neo and Trinity were played by original cast but Morpheus and Smith wasnt You can try to explain this throughout the movie but then the story became chaosOn part of the effects its all great and the fight scenes were stunning too but the further you went into this flick the more it lost its attractionIt starts off rather okay with the making of the game but once they do get into the matrix I was lost And why does every flick has to be over hours You really have to get a strong story to do soSo overall nice to see the fighting scenes again and the classic shots from the original but one you have seen and forgot all about the next dayGore

First of all an eighth of the movie comprises of flashbacks from previous  which could have been easily replaced better content Keanus own acting of being seemingly confused the entire time seems almost real as to why the heck am I in this movie in the first placeYou watch the movie and if you have seen the previous  you would miss the precision and sleekness which was in them in this movie The matrix program itself feels too real instead of reminding us that it is in fact a virtual reality systemThis movie should have focused on passing the baton from Keanu to some a new protagonist so as to pave way for more sequels A resurrection no one wished for,Notr
It is an EXCEEDINGLY RARE occurrence that a continuation reboot or even a sequel  prequel is done properly The Matrix Resurrections grew a bit I am trying to say my best to NOT say aged on that note Keanu Reeves seems to have aged far less than everyone else in the movieFor everyone who gives low reviews What do you imagine as something that could ever satisfy you as a continuation of the original trilogySo I say that this was a rather decent attempt given a constraint of a single film Yes there are some modern references There is a bit too much of references to the original trilogy There are a number of new ideas and quite plausible ones at thatThe only thing that is absolute bullocks about this movie is music The ending credits are absolutely nothing to bother listening thru not even for the endcredits joke So the endcredits music summarizes the overall quality of the movie compared to the original trilogyI say I have enjoyed this ThanksP S I would watch another one,Notr

I have watched the first movie when it releasedI was in high school back thenIt was greatIt was more than just a movieI bought the books the dvds watched and read it over and over againThe only thing i didnt like in this movie is the character who played by Neil Patrick HarrisHe turned that character into a jokeI think if you are a genuine matrix fan you will not dislike this movieI loved itWatched it  times,Notr

After seeing some pretty bad reviews for your film I feared the worst so it came as a great surprise that I really enjoyed it I found it kept in the vein of the originals and picked up the story well The were some good nods to the original as wellIncidentally my brother had not seen the original films and he really enjoyed it and thought they explained it wellMaybe it helped to have my expectations lowered,Notr
This movie didnt need to be made and it doesnt live up to any of the first three in the trilogy Its like everyone phoned it in  the actors the writers the directors SadSome of the main characters from the original got shortshrifted and that to me was the biggest disappointment and unforgivableUnoriginal unexciting and unfathomable why someone thought this was a good idea Three stars only because Keanu is in it,Notr
The entire plot of the movie just feels generic and lacking in any depth which make the entire thing feel unnecessary It feels like as though they made a story just to bring back Neo and trinity and the world for a few quick bucks The entire first act is just so drowned in nostalgia and self referential nods that I just found it hard to enjoy the movie Its not until maybe the last act where things feel somewhat original and by then I couldnt find any connection to the characters or why these events are even happening to begin with Its convoluted messy and generic all at the same time Not necessary viewing for Matrix fans,Notr
I have heard all the negative reviews but still decided to watch this This was such a mistakeFrom the very beginning I was holding myself from turning it off but eventually I couldnt handle it anymore This is just a pure garbage that tries to look clever and interesting In reality it is horrible in literally every aspect plot casting action sequences some weird Marvellike jokes that seem totally out of place I really cant understand how a movie that came out in  can look so much worse than the original that came out  years beforeDo yourself a favor  dont watch this trash and save some good memories about eradefining original,Notr
The Matrix Resurrections is the fourth film in the Matrix franchise Mr AndersonKeanu Reeves has to once again find out if hes inside the Matrix  must choose to find out the truth about his worldThe Matrix Resurrections is a great movie Writerdirector Lana Wachowski has given us a more selfaware and tongue in cheek sequel to a trilogy that really didnt need a fourth installment These meta references to the original trilogy are the highlight of the film The action set pieces are brilliant Keanu Reeves is spectacular as Neo CarrieAnne Moss is outstanding as Trinity Reeves  Moss share electrifying chemistry in all their scenes together Yahya AbdulMateen II is impressive as Morpheus but I definitely missed Laurence Fishburne Jonathan Groff is memorable as Smith Jessica Henwick is awesome as Bugs Neil Patrick Harris is hysterical as The Analyst Jada Pinkett Smith is good as Niobe Priyanka Chopra Jonas is superb as Sati The supporting cast is effective The Matrix Resurrections is worth a watch for fans of The Matrix trilogy Just keep your expectations relatively low,Notr
I asked myself that like  it was hardcore confusing there for a minute Look in a world of reboots remakes and lack of originality Matrix took a page from the selfaware and decided to make a fun satire crazy sequel literally no one asked for Its just big dumb fun and escape from the reality you know like how movies are supposed to beStill alot of Dragonball Z fiht scenes though,Notr
I really wanted to like this and I admit it has its moments but even considering the hate of the second and third installment this is the worst matrix movie of them allThe dialogue seems superficial uninviting and even comic at some points The pace of the movie is too consistant and gives no room to breathe and enjoy the depth and thoughts of any of the charactersThe matrix is a game theme could have worked but ended up as an unfunny parodyEven the song in the ending I would guess should be a nod to the rage against the machine track used in the original but using Brass against is another cringe worthy parodySave your theatre money and watch it on your couch a sunday afternoon when you have nothing else to do,Notr
My first watch through I was not impressed with the depths of the philosophy with very basic and obvious questions on what is real On a second viewing the key scene where Sheperd tells Neo Everything was simpler back then People wanted to be free Its different now Sometimes it feels like people gave up Like the Matrix won The Matrix won because weve all become so addicted to the noise constantly being pumped at us or as Merv puts it FaceZuckerSuck The Analyst plays on our desires and fears Quietly yearning for what you dont have while dreading losing what you do Its a direct commentary on the state of our world today So glad I was able to take in a nd viewing after having some time in between to reflect on it,Notr
Walked outTerrible lines terrible in every sense Lots of repetition from the st film Cant think up anything new it seems Give me my money back and burn the film tapeIf you have some spare sandpaper better off rubbing it in your eyes with a dash of vinegarBut seriously dont watch it and just forget it was ever made,Notr
After all these years the first Matrix is still the best movie in the series but if you liked Matrix  and  then you wont be dissapointed The story was interestingalthough it was more like sidestory when compared to trilogy i liked all the nostalgia stuff and callbacks to previous films the humour was suprisingly well done and it didnt feel insulting to the series and i think they explained a lot of what happened since the trilogy took place really well What i didnt like was the action scenes because come on  Its MATRIX  where almost everything is possible they could be a little bit more creative Neo could be more creative,Notr
Ok you wanted to make it anywayWhy on earth did you came up with such a poor script About  years passed and no interesting ideas appearedIs a shame this movie is called MatrixI was pretty mad viewing the first part wich was some kind of parody with characters lacking interestThen the movie just forgot it is intended to entertain the viewerSuch a disrespectful movie to its legacy,Notr
Even though the nostalgia can be too much and heavy handed at times the Matrix Resurrections is the best Matrix sequel so far an appropriately meta stylish and surprisingly funny film thats also got plenty of heart and interesting new ideasKeanu Reeves gives an incredible lead performance with plenty of charm and is once again able to anchor the films more surreal and pretentious moments CarrieAnne Moss is great and has strong chemistry with Keanu Yahya AbdulMateen II is effortlessly cool and suave and Jessica Henwick gives the best performance out of the new charactersLana Wachowskis direction is really good its visually slick with well filmed action set pieces even if they arent as satisfyingly clean as the previous ones The CG is mostly impressive and the music by Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer is also really good less hitech sounding than the previous ones,Notr
"This is my fandom I love this franchise The games movies one offs everything I love it I dont know who this movie is forThis is a fan film That may be a disservice to fan films but it is badPositives Keanu doesnt miss a beat as NeoMixed CGI is good at time but need a touch up in several shots
Negatives Plot is  exposition and one  of that is relevant Meta is out of control Action is awful Little to no Martial arts and just force pushing Editing is atrocious pulling from past clips choppy action no continuity through theme just bad at a technical level and a story level",Notr
The only credit I will give this movie is that at least it doesnt do to Neo what Disney did to Luke in the Star Wars sequels Other than that the film is a dud The costumes are weak The sets are bad The fights are boring The new Agent Smith and Neil Patrick Harris are forgettable Its not as bad as XMen Three The Last Stand or Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull or the Star Wars prequels or sequels but its forgettable,Notr
Thomas Anderson now without his indelible nom de guerre Neo is a game designer in a constant state of unease mostly cause hes not living the life he should be Begins with a bit of nostalgia for those fond of s debut but fails to go much further than that nearly two decades have passed since the last entry yet despite any technological advancements in that time the special effects are pretty mundane and the fight scenes try but fail to replicate the earlier films as they lack tension or innovation Much of the time Reeves looks like he should be elsewhere he and Moss only have a shell of their former chemistry and even worse new casting in previously iconic roles along with multiple flashbacks warrant a shake of the head as to how vastly inferior this latest showing really is A lot of talk and explanation most of it just word salad likely to convince fans that there was a valid reason to produce this disjointed sequel in the first place just what was the goal here ,Notr
First  its a tough act to follow  but they did a pretty good job with this I enjoyed it A good follow up and continuation of the story Only thing it really really really needed  was the real Morpheus and Agent Smith All that said though  it was still definitely the weakest of all Tye Matrix films I wis it would have been a home run  but it was a base hit at best,Notr
I would give it  stars only because of Keanu otherwise the movie was bad Truly bad I dont believe this movie can be a part of the initial trilogy There isnt any place to compare at allseems with time we lose good movies which is sad,Notr
Not much else to add to the other reviews really Its a long film with a boring plot and flat characters They should have just stopped after the trilogy I dont think Id even bother to see anymore if they do any Dont waste your ti e watching,Notr
I gave it  stars and this is only because of the history of matrix I am so upset because of watching this What a disappointment I hope it will be better on next movie Thanks for reading this It seems like you have lots of free time You should Do better things in your life,Notr
The original trilogy was coherent unlike the current iteration The plot was confusing jumped around and the first hour was forced boring and did not do much to set the tone mood or anything else regarding the plotCould have easily been a good movie if everything wasnt forced and there was some semblance of a timeline,Notr
There are those who didnt want to be bothered with the philosophy the ideas behind the matrix trilogy who didnt want to think deeper and thus didnt like the sequels This movie will have the same fate It explores several themes what happens after the prophecy is fulfilled How are people controlled by marginalizing their faith their ideas their legends their stories What role does human connection play in giving people power and freedom of thought Emotion is easier to manipulate than rational thought The balance between hope and the pursuit of dreams vs Being held back by the fear of losing what you haveSo well done and a wonderful continuation of the original story and even adds to the depth of the original three True matrix fans will be enthralled and captivated,Notr
From oustanding and visionary The Matrix through medicore Reloaded and Revolutions to this fake that should not be called Matrix In my opinion this movie should not exist This movie is like turtle trying to follow and catch rabbit  I cannot understand why and for what I do not recommend its a waste of time,Notr
I hope this movie sets the example of how horrible a reboot can crash and burn non stop This is a slap to the face to all Matrix fans This is an abomination to the series It is a joke A horrible spoof A complete waste of time This is my first time writing a review because I cannot fathom this atrocity O M G,Notr
WHY WHY WHY do Hollywood keep turning everything into a Feminist project  They Bomb one after the other and they dont seem to learn the lesson that no one goes to watch a movie to see forced lines about woman oppression and womans rights or woman can do it better Just give us a good story and good actors stop turning everything into a political drama This is a Feminist version of Matrix if thats your thing then this is for you if not then skip it and save your money,Notr
I was so eager for this movie And probably that is why it seemed like a letdown to meThe movie plays with The Matrix world but it lost all the charms it had  years agoEven Keanu as Neo didnt has the same dynamic anymoreThe movie did a bad job in every aspect whether it is direction storyline characters cinematography etcThe action sequences was decent at bestMatrix  was so amazing with action and now after  years this is the one thing in which they could do a really good job but it was so bad that it felt like watching a TV series rather than a movie in some scenesNew Morpheus was not serious but kinda like cranky New agent smith was somewhat watchable also Neil did a good job as an antagonist who was not powerfulPlot was so loose that they didnt offer anything good to the storyOverall it was not upto a good movie standard let alone considering it a Matrix partHope they dont repeat it ever again,Notr
I went into the movie heaps excited as Matrix  was a classicOh man Im speechless on how bad the movie wasHorrible fight speech poor special effects and horrible horrible storySo bad I stop watching half way or was it  of the way Who caresLana should never direct again,Notr
I mustve watched a different movie because I enjoyed it Definitely better than the first  sequels The special effects have obviously improved and the love between Neo and Trinity is as strong as ever,Notr
Im so angry at this movie and Lana Watchowski for making it There are so meany things wrong with this money it feels cheap like almost meaning less and just pure pop The first movie has purpose a clear purpose to save humanity the last remaining city etc But here theres no urgency theres no higher purpose just a love a story that doesnt seem to need to exist the whole arc feels purposeless The supporting characters feel so fake so out of place the dialogue is full of slang pop culture language that doesnt make sense it almost feels like a teenager wrote this Neo feels truly stupid and clumsy instead of powerful and purposeful I could really go on worst matrix movie every such a missed opportunity,Notr
If you are a true fan of the franchise then you will love this film It looks stunning glossy colourful and plays cleverly with the narrative of the original trilogy and its place in the minds of the characters in this new MatrixIm glad I read the interview with Lana Wachowski explaining where this story came from and the reason she revisited this universe Knowing her reasons allows you to experience the story differently as a beautiful love story of characters that are so obviously important to herI was also impressedrelieved with how the resurrections are explained  even though this is Scifi it made sense and not too farfetched Very clever stitching of the bridge between the original  films and this new story Nothing is erased or apologised for which is awesome and full of integrityGive it a chance,Notr
A good sequel for our times spelling out its callbacks in a similar manner to a Stewart Lee routine ruminating on means of control and the society of the spectacle in a more amusing manner than the other  sequels Use of same effects techniques as the Mandalorian gives it a slick look If you saw the other sequels youll watch this What choice do you have,Notr
Cash grab sequelPoor direction and scriptSet itself for more sequelsEdting and sound scape so soExtended use of st movie clips redundant Actingdirecting uninspired Stick with the original st oneNot recommended,Notr
You dont fix what isnt broken we were all ok with the trilogy and forgot about it you dont need to resurrect it by making a th movie This movie felt like a cartoon plot was childish and forced performances werent all great and  of the movie are references from the trilogy Fighting sequences felt weird and archaic basically cuz they tried introducing new elements that rather ruined it combined with unnecessary slowmo shotsit had its few fun moments and thats all this movie brought me no joy and will hardly recommend it,Notr
If youre here to see what other people think about it because youre not sure how to feel about it you should rewatch it If youre here to see if its worth watching did you really even have a choice Watch it I feel like a lot of people are forgetting what the point of this all is Youre meant to enjoy the movie It might not be exactly the same as the first movie and it might not share the same mood as the trilogy but isnt that the point Theyre not trying to do the same old remake Theyre trying to free your mind,Notr
 The acting is terrible the only good act was the black cat Fight scenes are really slow and predictable Even my  year old is faster The whole story is not about Neo Change of style Fly away ending without solving any issues Worst movie of  i can assure you that,Notr
Nobody told me that The Matrix Resurrections is parody on The Matrix trilogy or is it just my way of softening the sad truth I wish I knew that before I watched it Its just very bad and sad film From the game changer when the first film came out also second and third to the ridiculousness of this one I wish I havent seen itBiggest fail of them all I feel sorry for everyone involved in this sadness especially for those who are to consume this piece of well nothing Reeves character is very badly written that its almost painful to watch wish they tried and find someone else to play this role out of respect for Neo from before Also subtle woke moments cmon,Notr
The Matrix Resurrections is an Action  SciFi movie and the fourth movie of the The Matrix franchise in which we watch the two realities come together and Mr Anderson needs to find and follow the correct oneSince I had already watched the trilogy I knew the story behind it but I did not know what to expect from this fourth movie After watching it I understand why a lot of people were disappointed by it and the main reason was that they expected too much The plot was for one more time interesting and it was really nice watching again some of the main characters The interpretations of Keanu Reeves who played as Neo CarrieAnne Moss who played as Trinity Yahya AbdulMateen II who played as Morpheus and Jessica Henwick who played as Bugs were very good In conclusion I have to say that The Matrix Resurrections is a nice movie but if you have high expectations I am sure you will be disappointed,Notr
Sadly its a level of a Marvel flickThe clue is there  one of a dialog line says Warner Bros will do a reboot of Matrix with original director  or without  Guess without it would be worse,Notr
Something that started out rock solid super cool goes from a  to a  in  LOOOOONNNNG movies I was hoping this was going to be the one that started The Matrix series back in upward movement but clearly about  minutes in it just wasnt going to happen Why oh why could they not do something cool with lots of energy I understand why some decided not to return to this bloated love story that should have never been made,Notr
Lana did a good job A wickedly entertaining delightfully romantic addition to the Matrix and it was about both of them Neo and Trinity It is the new beginning with new crew members and another cat along with a small post credit scene The Catrix,Notr
Lana has a brilliant creative mind Definitely made up for the let down of  and   and  were good but not as legend as  is This movie was a thank you to part  The ending was chills and goosebumps Perfect,Notr
A lot of dialogue less action When its characters talking their words are boring and unmemorable When its action the action is boring and a chore to watch This new Matrix manages to be the worst one so far If you are not planning on seeing this movie keep doing whatever it is youre doing,Notr
The actions scenes are really bad all the fighting is off and dull Its clearly different than the  first movies And the fact morpheus  smith are not anymore here is just weird,Notr
The most important success of the movie is that people who watch it feel the need to watch the first The Matrix movie and Animatrix seriesOh and Jefferson Airplay on the agenda againOther than that I will never understand why people I trust give this movie  stars  on imdb or higherI battled on EBay for the Animatrix and The Matrix K collection but I wont be buying this movie as physical media I probably wont buy it until its the discounted movie of the week on Itunes,Notr
No spoilers critical review There are bits of the new matrix that feel a little too light  not dark or gritty enough in places There were a few very corny friendly robots but overall I had fun watching the film despite it not feeling as deep as the first oneVisually it was filmed with excellent CGI that wasnt distracting or overly gimmicky I liked that it kind of broke the fourth wall a bit at the startThe side characters were mostly decent other than just one or maybe two that could have been darker  grittierTheres definitely a LOT of messaging from the sisters around gender identity and transformation which is more on the the nose  accessible than in the first filmsThere was a disappointing cover of a great track from the first film which harshed my vibe a bit it didnt have the same effectThe first half of the film felt a bit deeper than the second halfIt felt in general its probably on par with the second film in a different way It was fun it didnt move me like the first film did but Im glad they made itOverall I think Id call it ,Notr
Surely They could of done better than thisThe movie is incoherent sure you could probably understand it after  or  more viewings but this movie isnt good enough for that many viewingsIm sorry but they missed the mark big time you cant follow what is going on in the movie therefore you dont care about the damn movieThere are some good action scenes though and a funny joke with neo near the endBut this is a dud ,Notr
"This is a much better movie if you view it as a middle finger to the studio and mocking Hollywood reboots wokeness and trash sequels Lol
The Code Awakens
An excellent parody ",Notr
I wish i hadnt seen it and The Matrix had for me remained a trilogyThats really all one needs to say about itIf pushed i would say most of the film is spent flailing around trying to explain its reason for beingthe movie itself seems to wonder why it even exists and i certainly cant explain itLove Keanu But he should have left this alone star because Keanu is a top bloke,Notr
Thats how I felt throughout this whole films action sequences So messy so laughably bad SO MUCH POTENTIALIm not going to fart in its mouth too much because the concept I liked Morpheus I didnt and the story made sense I feel It was just a MESS NOISE AND LIGHTS The one thing that set matrix apart from all other modern a tion films was left in the toilet here and just had a smelly old mans toe stuck up its bumI truly believes theres  cut of this film that exists and its great Give us that We will payPs RIP Wilfred Brambell Legend,Notr
The concept that I believe they were shooting for was fun but the plot fell through and failed to land In fact I think the plot blew up like those helicopters but it was fun at least,Notr
Keep your expectations low and youll never be disappointed My expectations were low and this movie was still disappointingThis did not feel or look like Matrix whatsoever This movie was NOT needed at all Just another money grab by warner brosEverything went wrong They should have left this trilogy well alone This ruined it for me not going to lie Just whyUnoriginal unexciting and unfathomable Why someone thought this was a good idea is laughable,Notr
Awful sound editing left me wishing for subtitles Heavy reliance that people will either have watched the trilogy again before viewing or possess a fantastic memory to link all the callbacks Plot is very thin and the visuals are nothing special,Notr
Trying to understand why this film was made in the first place I can see how they want to rewrite the trilogy ending but after  hrs that felt like  days We didnt learn anything that We didnt already know Too much nostalgia and felt like a film about a film treating me like a  yr old like who ISNT going to figure out who is Morphious and Smith Seriously And an eternity of closeup dialogue from the old Matrix players fighting for Smith This is the best they could come up with this talented of a team Feels like lots of potential wasted,Notr
The other  below reviews say it all in short this is a incoherent mess But this abomination of a film puts the exclamation on the state of todays movie making which is in the gutter Why are so many awful scripts like this one getting green lit Doesnt stop there insert obvious covid stricken production lackluster directing wooden acting woke identity politics terrible editing incoherent and boring storylines that make you want to walk out halfway through Not too long ago Hollywood gave us Joker a masterpiece not to mention it made tons of cash People want to go to the movie theater to be entertained not insulted with garbage,Notr
Too fast cuts bad soundtrack too much gunfire bad villain character No matrix feeling But its entertainment if you dont know the old movies So unfortunately I have to give  stars,Notr
This movie was much anticipated but felt rushed and lacking in action It was great to see how they explain how they were able to bring Neo and Trinity back from the dead but as the main focus of the movie being them getting back together realizing this and seeing how much of the runtime was left I realized the movie was not going to be great We are now left with more questions and probably wont get more movies after this to explain them Hopefully we do and hopefully they are better If you go into the movie knowing its about them getting back together again not bad Nostalgia was also very high and was happy to see references to the other films,Notr
There wasnt a red tread through the movie there was a ball of yarn that somebody had set on fireThere was points where we would laugh out loud not because of the comedy that was inserted into the movie but because of silly things on screen mistakes bad CGI and plotholes There is a moment in this movie where a helicopter disappears completely for like  min only to return right where it should have been all the time so it again can shoot at the main actors it made no sense but someone must have forgot it was there from the startLike I said this is more like a spoof movie of the Matrix it really has no connection that makes sense to the old movies and the story isnt moved forward in any meaningful way A hero journey is also only as good or interesting as the villain in the story and here they are all bad its more bad boys in a ally than a threat you feel could be a actual problem,Notr
Im not much of a reviewer But I couldnt help myself with this film Before watching the movie I was very excited and I was looking forward to seeing it But after watching the movie I came to the conclusion that I should visit The Analyst and perhaps he might prescribe me some blue pills that I would be imprisoned within the world of The Matrix ,Notr
My expectations is high when I have heard the new part of matrix going to release So that feel full of excitement But when Im went to cinema I found nothing new nothing any twist nothing good action and not even new effects also Except Neo and trinity all others are new faces but thing is that no any improvised script It dissapoint for meBut yeah For a new audiences it would be new action scfiction flickAs an Indian audience good to see miss priyanka Chopra Thats all,Notr
The first half was ok It didnt build any excitement sorts but I was curious as to find how it will unfold and what is going on But in the last fifteen minutes I felt I am watching a comedy movie Suddenly the matrix movie feel is gone and I started seeing everything in a comic way,Notr
I have seen this update to the Matrix franchise  times and i understand why there are such low ratings First it takes  minutes to get cooking second its another femcentric film which i have no problem with there is a formulaic feel to all the fight scenes and keanu just wasnt there for this one All in all as a stand alone film it was thrilling to watch but also a let down,Notr
No matter what they say it is amazing to see this world again So some people say it wasnt like they were expecting but it is the first movie after the trilogy for this reason there were so many explanations about what happened So my suggestion is to lower your expectations because It is a bridge movie to connect the trilogy with the new one but I am pretty sure the next ones will be amazing I am really excited to see what is going to happen in the next movies We must be honored to be able to watch The Matrix again,Notr
It started of well with the whole Surreal reality thing and the concept that the previous trilogy was a game You can also tell that theres alot of money has gone into it But thats about it Everything else was a disaster,Notr
I dont write reviews ever However being a matrix trilogy fan I thought I point out the weak parts in my opinion Apart from the not so convincing storyline NPH made this movie worse Come on he is a a comedian Why him Giving him the analyst role was probably one of the mistakes Im not watching matrix for laughs,Notr
I absolutely loved the first movie in the series And the two sequels were not bad either But thisthis mockery of movie making is one I looked so forward to it ending long before it did This is a story of a talented movie making duo making a movie when the talented one of the duo decides to not be a part of it Sad to see the end result Keanu is one of my favourite actors favourite people evenI cant believe he agreed to star in this movie Easy money I guessThis is a movie that probably had a big budget but plays like a low budget movie Low quality cast story plot and script Disappointing fight choreography to match The entire movie was a confusing contradiction Its trying to be a comedy but groans instead of laughs It tries to be action but punches well below the beltIs it possible to forget this movie and remember The Matrix of the past Yes if its anything its most surely forgettable,Notr
Im a massive fan of the original trilogy so I was exited about this but it ruins the other matrix films It even has to have a bugs bunny reference to just imply the film was a big joke and now Im annoyed that I had to give money to watch something that feels like a ripoff of great movies I cant understand why Reeves was in this film It doesnt even have good stunts like the old trilogy it just feels like a spoof or a ripoff of the trilogy and youd at least think the directors would keep remotely same ideas but no just a waste of time and money for everyone that made it and watched it,Notr
Storywise the movie could be satisfactory I appreciate the idea how to return the original characters to the matrix But the sheer amount of the scenes from the original trilogy is quite annoying and unnecessarySecond the action scenes are poorly made In some cases its due to a frequent camera changes making it difficult to track the action in other  simply not enough action itselfThird the development inside the matrix from some point became too rushed and quickly unbelievable It lasts until the end of the movie leaving plot holes that shouldnt have been there in the first placeI cannot blame actors albeit Ive expected more action from Keanu but I guess age puts its limits New actors including Morpheus are good enoughOverall it all boils down to a story A story what has happened to humans after Matrix  Unfortunately while this story has some good parts overall feels unbelievable for the fansId say its worth watching just to see the vision of the authors but it falls short of even moderate expectations,Notr
"We waited so long for the all time great comeback and this is the garbage we get Even with the modern technology the CGI was aweful and dark Action scenes were lame Though there are some cool camera anglesAbout the characters
Bugs was not as convincing for the role of a captainThey literally made Morpheus a joke characterKeanu couldve gotten a cool haircut and shave This is Neo after all and shouldnt look like some old bumSmith What is he even doing here Whats his purposeOverall I wouldnt recommed to waste your money on this cash grab garbage and watch something meaningfulI myself better go back watch Jon Wick for satisfaction",Notr
Despite the fact I often had little to no idea what was going on with this film I loved itTheres just something about The Matrix the whole world and universe that is so incredibly creative thought provoking and awe inspiring and I felt all of that returning to this fourth instalmentWhat I loved about the original films yes all of them was the deep science fiction mixed with a compelling love story political and social commentary and incredible action sequencesDid we get all of that with this film To an extentThe action sequences pale in comparison to the highs of the earlier films although there are some very cool moments The story is also perhaps a little looser but the rest is all thereI loved all of the meta references and on the whole I thought the plot was solid really doubling down on the love story to great effectTheres a lot unwarranted hate out there for this film and Im not sure why In truth it is probably the weakest of the franchise but is still very solid and it gives us a chance to return to the glorious world of the Matrix which I am all for,Notr
I am writing this while watching the film I am bored The story they are trying to tell is not needed and over explained The lack of Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishbourne also detractsJada pinkett Smith was bad enough in the last film but her acting under all the make up in this is laughableThe film was not needed at all and the story should of been left alone and finished in  where it endedThe visuals are good but not enough to save this poorly executed sequel,Notr
If you watch the Matrix trilogy right before you watch Matrix Resurrections you will have a good time You will not be lost or confused I really enjoyed this movie Its not among the best movies Ive ever seen which is why I give it the rating that I did,Notr
TLDR Save your money or your bandwidth This is a shameless cash grabThis joke of a movie shouldnt exist Its repetitive  boring beyond belief the acting is mediocre and the script is ordinaryIf you watch it for some mindless entertainment it may work for you  but this has nothing in common with the Matrix franchise as you remember it,Notr
This film is redundantIt has nothing to sayIt looks like Matrix but isnt MatrixI like Keanu but what this film make me realise It wasnt because of Keanu Matrix was great Not in the slightest And I hate itThat being said the first part of the movie was entertaining It looked like something great was going to happen It didntOnly disappointment happened,Notr
"I have tried to see it  times now everytime i stop the move in the scene when they are in cafe shop not long in the movie i just cant manage to see it i get so insane bad vibes low quality BFilm vibescash grabber it ruin everything I saw the first Matrix  times at the cinema i was stunnedcouldnt get enough i also loved Matrix  a lot too i seen them all about  times each lol
so after seeing all the comments about it i probably never see it i think the IMBD rating is rigged how could it get score at  So many movies i seen at  score is very good how I hope they release real one before all the actors are to old",Notr
This is awesome Never expected there would be another matrix movie I loved this movie and I would so love to see them make more If you are a fan then you will enjoy this,Notr
It was ok I watched the original trilogy leading up to seeing Resurrections Maybe that was a mistake The first thing I notice was how the quality seemed lowerwhich should be impossible with how much newer the technology is I have my suspicions as to why they would allow us to feel that way in the opening sequence But without knowing their motivation I was left underwhelmed and actively thinking how this felt cheapThe story is alright nothing special There are a few familiar faces But I never felt a connection to the new ones For such a long movie it felt lacking in storytelling which shouldnt be possibleIf they make another one Ill probably watch it But this movie either didnt need to be made or needed more time cooking I do wonder if missing onehalf of the original visionaries meant we also lost half of the vision and creativity,Notr
Every matrix simulation had a version covered by some delightful philosophy which tries to enslave humanity in different waysVersion in this movie had a really good idea whereas it got mentioned only IN A SINGLE FREAKING SENTENCE Its not in the atmosphere not anywhereIts clear that directors choose the path of creating CGI that is worse than any Marvel movie instead of showing humanitys interaction with desireSHAME,Notr
First of all you dont wait  yrs and not make a D iMax especially in this seriesThe movie itself this is typical  film industry garbage They make films so procedurally nowadays their is no creativity The young actors of course sucked as usual these days The visuals werent even as good as the first movie The story as usual nowadays it made absolutely no sense and didnt even add up A lot of this film didnt even mesh together This film has so much left leaning political agendas to it the casting makes that clear and I think maybe this film was supposed to be a comedy Idk idk what I watched it wasnt the matrix but Im not surprised its junk that is all our current generation produces And like everything made these days youre supposed to know outside information just watching itIm  and I have no hope for the filming industry anymore too much about making money and political agendas,Notr
Just like the song says You gotta know when to hold em They should have folded it at a trilogy There are moments that live up to the originals but not enough Cringe worthy ones include Jada Smith and her ridiculous makeup and the new agent smiths clunky fight scenes PLEASE dont make any more,Notr
What else were you expecting Loved the call backs to previous films Action seemed a little repetitive for some of it but the concept of putting the two main characters against each other in the matrix made sense Story had a few holes but if you sit back and enjoy then you wont walk away disappointed Not saying Im gonna award an Oscar but if you thought anything different going into this then you dont understand Hollywood,Notr
I rarely put comment  but this week I saw an amazing movie dont look up and a daube that is what we call a terrible movie in FrenchI watched this movie because i could not believe the comments I could not believe Keanu one of my favorite actor could be under diazepam the whole movieJust dont waste your time the room from Tommy Wiseau is much better,Notr
The Matrix franchise is over I really cant wrap my head around this film Lazy writing OK special effects and weak characters My wife fell asleep halfway through and I found myself constantly yawning This is a movie that shouldve been made  years ago The new young Morpheus is a joke I wouldve preferred a CGi version of Mr Fishburne instead Either youre going to love or hate the new Matrix I choose the latter for various reasons Heck I think it wouldve made a better video game than movie Now I highly suggest you lower your expectations before watching it because you will be disappointed if youre looking for a  Matrix filmhighly disappointedyou can tell it was made during the pandemic,Notr
It is an OK movie I guess but this is not enough to justify its existence for me And I would have preferred more original ideas rather than a remake of all the iconic scenes from the first movieThe best part of the movie is that it makes me want to see the first Matrix again,Notr
So I dont leave many reviews  I just score the movies and leave it at that NormallyOK so its not terrible It just doesnt feelright somehow The ideas and some of the set pieces are cool The acting from Keanu and Carrie is actually pretty cool it just doesnt seem to all gel together Basically its a solid  just for the ideas and some of the set piecess But at the crux of it all it doesnt feelrightJust my thoughts,Notr
  half of it is made up of archive footage from previous installments of the series and the other half is comprised of one of Keanu Reeves worst acting performances to date but please Hollywood executives take this as your sign to cast Jonathan Groff in more movies,Notr
To be honest my expectations werent high Revivals after two decades almost never fair well This film spends a lot of time displaying flashbacks of the original trilogy scenes to earn brownie points with OG fans but this new installment doesnt bring anything new to the table as far as science fiction is concern It just reiterates the original story with an added gamingprogrammer side story of which there are countless on Netflix They even rehash some of the original special effects again into this filmThis installment turns into a romance between Neo and Trinity where Neo tries to recapture a lost love Probably the only good thing about the film was some of the martial arts fighting between Neo and Morpheus But thats not enough to make this film worth rewatchingThe film is a letdown And producers let Keanu Reeves get some muchneeded sleep He looked like he was half asleep in all of his scenes,Notr
Zero thought and effort was put into the making of this film I am a big matrix fan and I honestly cant remember the last time I was this disappointed The ending is soooo cringy I just want to cry,Notr
If you liked the recent Bill and Teds horrid movie or you liked The last Jedi with not a single lightsaber fightlook it up not a single lightsaber touched anotherthese shit encore money grabs really need to endOLD HENRY is x better than this shit,Notr
You would hope that after  years a sequel would be a big eyepopping production Sadly thats not Resurrection If anything it came across as a lower budget version of the original Matrix if it was a series pilot on the SyFy network It also clearly shows that the first movie was the best and each subsequent installment was a shallower and more convoluted version of the original,Notr
A good movie and it is almost a good sequel I loved the events and the plot Frankly the movie was able to convey the feelings of the characters It has good characters and also the dialogues Each dialogue The movie reminds you of some of the parts before and frankly they presented the dialogues in a smooth and enjoyable way and praised the element The evil in the film which was presented to us by Neil Patrick which was surprisingly good but I did not like the speed in the transition between events I felt that everything happened quickly and also I did not like the story of the film which was bad looking at the seasons before but the film is good and deserves to be watched strongly but before watching it you should watch the parts that came before to remember the events,Notr
There were points of it being really great  notably the beginning But so much of it is poor transitions followed by confusing dialog I found myself rewinding to see if I missed something multiple times  but no I hadnt missed anything The transitions between scenes and the editing in general is just badAlso WB needs to stop promoting themselves in everything they do Space Jam  Only Disney is allowed to do that  WB is no Disney Which to me is just another sign that their franchises need to dieIn the end it is a decent flick with some good performances and an alright storyButTHE MATRIX is not properly RELOADED it is not a REVOLUTION and has not had any RESURRECTIONS haha,Notr
I thought the film was confusing while mildly entertaining Seemingly the idea is Neo and Trinity were trying to be kept apart at all costs because their connection always disrupted the programming of the matrix at least this is how I perceive itThe film tries to do a lot in a short period of time and I just dont think it was as ground breaking or entertaining as its predecessors At the same token it wasnt a complete waste of time Im probably not going to watch it again and it wont hurt if you wait until this is available on dvd or to stream online I wouldnt run out of your way to see it like I did unless you are an absolute die hard fan of the matrix,Notr
Its back to the Matrix roots and only has a slight tranny flair that Lana couldnt escape from I guess all her sibling brought to the table was extra restraint which might have made this film better but its hard to knowMatrix  and  were disappointments for me but people that liked them will appreciate this movie because it builds on top of the story of those movies tooIts fun It has a story to tell and its repetition isnt as bad the Star Wars rehashes because repetition is part of the story of The MatrixIt has flaws but not too many I think this movie will be enjoyed by nearly everyoneThe ending is a bit gay but nothing to ruin the story unlike most other Hollywood movies out thereThis is a pretty good thirdsequel which isnt saying much,Notr
This movie is a lazy lackluster attempt to try to modernize the matrix Piloted by a clearly aging Keanu Reeves The Matrix Resurrections features poor action horrible cinematography and disappointing performances galore The part I personally found insulting was the constant use of actual footage from the first  films as if they thought the audience needed a constant reminder of what had already happened It is clear that either Lana Wachowski has completely lost the plot or that this film was intentionally sabotaged to serve as a satire of reboots It is clear that theres bad blood between Lana Wachowski and Warner Brothers as it is quite literally stated in the film that they were forced to make another sequel whether they wanted to or not,Notr
A truly fun and exciting return to the matrixEverything in the universe evolved and grew in a logical and believable way I was amazed how lana watchowsky delivered the movie in such a way you would think she directed the last Matrix just a few years ago instead it was  years since the first oneWhat im trying to say is if you are a matrix fan you wont be dissapointedSupporting characters were suprisingly likable and interestingHugo Weiving was missed but the story redemeed his absense in a really interesting wayDont get too stressed reading some of the dissapointments here in the review and feel guilty about liking Matrix  we s kids deserved thisIm truly happy this film exists,Notr
Beautiful Amazing Breathtaking As a huge Matrix fan I couldnt wait to watch Resurrections and it exceeds all my expectations Full with metaphors and analogies which means it is for those who can open their minds and who are able to experience this world or other worlds on another level as wellWell done Lana well done Thank youIf you are reading this and havent seen the movie yet please dont believe the haters Let your own heart guide you and make your own choice We are controlled in so many other ways,Notr
Selfreference on top of selfreference Time passes quickly in the first part of the film as you rack your brains to understand the scenario The second half is clearer and allows several elements of the quadrilogy to be tied together The fact that certain major characters are not played by the original actors makes understanding more complex but the numerous extracts from the first films make it possible to find them On the production side its good we keep the usual benchmarks but there are few innovations It wont be a remarkable film but it will please fans of the world of The Matrix I dont see the point of a sequel,Notr
It was a risky decision but I feel like it didnt go wrongInstead of giving us what we expected The movie is more like a meeting with fans of the sagaThe movie does not take itself seriously many times and breaks the fourth wall But this is not just for joking there is a lot of criticism of the industry and the lifestyle of these timesSo thats my warning dont see them waiting for matrix  See it more as a reunion with the saga where we can joke and comment while we watch it,Notr
The only good thing about this movie and why I gave it  stars was because Keanu blessed us with his presence But even he could not save this film Im sure he was embarrassed by this utter master fail Carrie Ann Moss did as well as possible with what she was given to work withThis pathetic storyline makes no sense but depends on past movie scenes to attempt at making it somewhat relevant or enjoyableJadas acting is some of the worst Ive seen and that says a lot Her hunched over decrepit portrayal is laughable Why do casting agents still portray herAll I can say is save yourself some valuable time  do not watch mess,Notr
So for all the heaters out ther just stop it It was pretty entertaining and was fun to watch Was it necessary Did it add anything meaningful to the story Nop Completly unnecessary But it was not a wast of money and I had a good time So yeah go watch it and have a good time as well,Notr
I personally loved the trilogies Theyre my alltime favorites But the story in this movie was the convoluted mess Ive ever laid eyes on The characters were poorly executed and had no substance The plot direction left kept me askingis this really it What was Lana Wakowski thinking This felt more like a cash grab than anything and was a huge disappointment to the Matrix fan base out there Either you need to fix this or leave it beplease,Notr
The Matrix Resurrections does an adequate job of explaining HOW it exists as a sequel to the trilogy yet it doesnt really justify WHY it exists Its good to see Keanu Reeves and CarrieAnne Moss back in their respective roles although the rest of the cast and some of the action scenes are fairly forgettable This sequel also has the same pretentious tone the other sequels have None of them are as great as our first trip into The Matrix,Notr
Unfortunately this movie does not feel like a Matrix movie at all You might think this is some kind of a fan made web series interlaced together to become a movie called Matrix Resurrections and it only bears the name of Matrix for commercial reasonsI would have liked it to be much darker and without some cringe moments at the end of the movieI really liked the idea of how the villain is thinking to keep everything he benefits from alive and it would have been so much better if there was a plot twist at the end of the movieHowever I still want to see the bright side and think that all the characters were dreaming so that what they see is not the reality I hope they make a sequel for this one and right the wrongs by showing us that all we saw was just a dream,Notr
This movie was written and directed by one half of the Wachowski sibling duo and it shows A little too selfaware of itself at times with action scenes that look muddled and feel stifled the seemingly wide open expanse of the previous Matrix movies is reduced to obviously apparent soundstages in this one Whether its the budget or the missing Wachowski or something else there are flashes of what couldve been a really good movie but part of the magic is gone Or perhaps I set the bar too high Maybe I overlooked the flaws in the previous movies because I was blinded by the excitement and magic of its newness,Notr
MatrixResurrections felt like a stretch trying too hard to add to the mythology narrative Fans definitely would appreciate it overall but its like meeting an exgirlfriend who parted ways on good terms The warm ashes remain but the flames have long burned out Scales,Notr
Just awful Terrible acting from most insipid story woefully bad script just silly and bad The third movie tried too hard and was subsequently bad in many places this is just bad throughout The characters shout at nearly every weird moment like a TV episode so you understand the moment There is no redemption from this other than it looks great in places,Notr
Before watching Matrix Resurrections I watched Matrix Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions I also reread Platos Allegory of the Cave and commentary about knowing if we were shadow followers or notI watched Matrix Resurrections with an open mind and paid more attention to the dialogue I enjoyed the action and the special effects as well As I watch major themes of truth reality choice peace and love played out The questions posed throughout the movie will always be asked What are you looking for What do you want Who are youMatrix Resurrections provides answers to questions raised in the earlier movies and raises new questionsIn order to keep balance and harmony in the world we need to be engaged in dialogue with each other learning what reality is what truth is what peace is and what love isMatrix Resurrections provides a framework for us,Notr
You know I like the Matrix and was very excited for it I saw the trailer and it looked promising but this was not worth my timeIt simply felt empty something was missing I would not recommend watching this movie unless you want to feel completely and utterly disappointed,Notr
The mission was simple come up with an entertaining followup to The Matrix in particular of interest to a loyal following at least those fans not feeling burned by the two inferior sequels But half of the Wachowski team of socalled visionaries ended up shooting storyboard content that makes little to no sense alienating those fansThe general outline of the movie is there but the connections between the real characters of Neo and Trinity with their representations in The Matrix are confused and very confusing So one sits watching lugubrious soulsearching melodramatically sentimental the power of love scenes punctuated by busy SPFX and action scenes that are so typical of the publics acquiescence in recent decades to mindless superherocomic strip fantasy and violent visuals,Notr
I was surprised by all the bad reviews but decided to take a chance on this one anyway I was happy I did I think going in with lowered expectations helpedI saw a review that said if felt like cheap tv and that is correct most of the cinematography lends to a feel that they had to go the cheap route dark lighting the fight scenes lack a certain sharpness Think what it looks like to watch a soap opera vs seeing something on the big screen The production is way differentWithout giving anything away I think they did a good job explaining how and why there is another Matrix movie and how and why the characters are where they are It did feel rushed at times there is not much character development I think if you havent seen the previous movies this one wont make much sense as nothing is really explained in great detailI would definitely say this is the weakest of the  movies but still feels like it belongs in the universe I can see where they wanted this movie to go and am more than happy to follow along,Notr
I wont say I regret watching this wasted effort I will say Im glad to have seen it at home so as not to lament the spent moneyFor the first hour Matrix Resurrections takes us through a build up the seems to have some novelty Then it runs out of steam Rather than taking us to new revelations of the nature of the coexistence of life within The Matrix or even a deeper understanding of the sentient AI it simply devolves into a mindless actioncaper plotEntertaining but definitely not enlightening,Notr
I wanted to stop watching in the first  mins but decided to continue and god I wish I stopped The whole movie seems like its a parody or a fan made youtube video I have no idea how a writer who worked on all  previous movies directed such a horrible th,Notr
I just finished Matrix  I would say that the film itself was good Good actors and a decent plot What I struggle to understand was why did they actually make it  It must be to build on and make more films The end was a bit strange And I think it seems strange if they are not going to make a No  I think the end of No  was good enough so what was the point of reviving this universe if you do not build on it So all in all good but not sure why they made it,Notr
"Everything that made the Original Matrix trilogy amazing is completely missing from this movie
 A brilliant and intriguing plotline
 Precise and effective dialogue
 Superbly choreographed fight scenes and
 Fantastic production and editingThis th installment should never have been made",Notr
The movie is choking under too much random ideas which dont stand together to make up a solid world and trigger the suspension of disbelief But the one idea closing the movie at the end clicks so well that I immediately thought it shouldve been the first thing to play out in any sequel earlier,Notr
Everything in this movie is cheap and poor I thought I was watching a TV movie Action scenes were horrible and Keanu looked like he was sleeping It was so distracting that everyone looked so different  Keanu looks like John Wick,Notr
What a great job on bringing back this story It is difficult to resurrect characters who have died in previous movies but this was well thought outIt doesnt drag on it keeps you guessing how they are going to create the connection throughout the movie and then brings it all together all while keeping you on the edge of your seat,Notr
A shame  a film especially in todays world with so much potential that this film unfortunately does not even come close to exploiting Bad music bad casting bad story This film absolutely needs a Jack Snyder cut,Notr
It was the worst movie I have ever seenIf you have unneeded excessive time of your life just watch itI paid in the cinema money and my time to sit and enjoy it however it was misunderstood not clear and till now I didnt get it I couldnt complete it till the end  min then I left,Notr
This movie had promise in the first act I enjoyed it But the third act was terrible It went against everything in the trilogy and what the trilogy actually taught Disappointing,Notr
Pretty disappointing I guess its just hard to come up with something as good as the original Either was sort of boring exposition or just some action that didnt do anything new All the slomo visual effects felt lazy blurry and cheap Like they just pushed a slowmo button but didnt do anything new like the original did Neo just had so little to do or say and even Trinity didnt have much going on either for being the centerpiece of the film Just Meh Id rather just go and watch the Original or even  before watching this one again Bummer,Notr
Matrix  is so boring It feels as if was written and directed by Woody Allen Too many long useless sentimental conversations The action scenes are pathetic clichs in which there is no emotion whatsoever The story is terrible and is clearly intended to promote the leftist agenda relegating Neo the white male to the role of a useless jerk,Notr
I wanted to like this film as Im a HUGE fan of the other Matrix films This was just a mess from start to finish The user ecsecs summed it up quite nicelyThis is probably the last time Ill be visiting the movies as a whole Hollywood have now proven beyond an absolute doubt that they can no longer make movies,Notr
Seemly overly complicated story to make this movie work The new characters have not much for unique personalityIts like warmed up left overs with thrown in hot sauce too spice it up but it took and ruined the true essence of the dishDefinitely not as good as previous movies but entertaining none the lessHoping this was retire meant the Matrix movies,Notr
If you enjoy reading my SpoilerFree thoughts please follow my blog to read my full review The Matrix Resurrections is one of my biggest disappointments of the year Lana Wachowski delivers a surprisingly meta selfaware movie about the original trilogy packed with bold fascinating ideas but an absolutely terrible executionFrom the dreadfully unfunny cringeworthy brainstorming sessions about the previous films to the heavyhanded headacheinducing exposition the director constantly tries to tell the viewers how incredible the original trilogy is forgetting to create a compelling captivating story for this new installmentThe gorgeous visuals and impactful score arent good enough to elevate the shockingly average choppy action sequences Despite remarkable performances from Keanu Reeves CarrieAnne Moss and the standout Jessica Henwick Resurrections just didnt work for meIf youre a fan of the franchise I obviously recommend watching it Just be aware that this isnt a new The Matrix movie but instead a film about the actual sagaRating C,Notr
First of all you must be a die hard fan of the Trilogy  Castaneda and Eastern philosophy to understand it Im no specialist in CGI effects and fighting scenes but the the first half of the movie is Tarkowski level with clues and referrals to discover themeverywhere and the second half an ode to freedom which is harder to get the older you are as Don Juan said when describing to Castaneda the enemies of the man of knowledge All in all I found it brilliant an deeper than many movies at the Matrix One level Thoroughly enjoyed it,Notr
Had a hard time staying awake through this movie Its just what one would expect from a sequel made nowadays to movie franchises which are more than  years old Lots of nostalgia lazy script boring story Its just milkingSome parts of the story was kind of interesting But most of it was too boringNostalgia bait scenes were meh Same with the meta stuff I dont know how adding meta stuff makes the movie any entertaining Action scenes too were just meh Nothing Id remember after a day or twoThis was definitely an unnecessary sequelMaybe if you are a fan of all the three previous movies which I doubt you may like this one,Notr
This film did exactly what I had hoped it would do The end of the third film it shows the love and sacrifice of Neo and Trinity not only for each other but for all of mankindThey also showed how the current architect of this new Matrix the so called Dr Is much like our current president He understands humans so he uses fear of the unknown against us He pits us against one another and sets back and smiles at the chaos hes causingThe best part though is this movie allowed for both Trinity and Neo to be equal Cause lets face it without each other neither of the two would have survived without the other,Notr
There is nothing positive to say about this movie Acting  sucks Fighting scenes  suck cinematography  sucks story  script  suck hardSave yourself the time Even watching it just for the sake of it aint worth it Its so bad youll actually start wondering if youre being punkd Its what you get with woke culture and mentally ill people with their hands in hollywood This film is and all jokes aside one of the worst ever made Hands down up there with films like The Room  Mars Attacks,Notr
We need to stop making reboots just for the sake of making reboots This feels nothing like the original trilogy its weird to watch and its a lot of recycled material Quite disappointing,Notr
I went in as a fan of The Matrix with low expectations I was intrigued from the start It only got more interesting from there Its been days since Ive seen it and Im still thinking about it Thats so rare I thought they handled the story brilliantly I enjoyed it more than the original equals There was just a little heart in this movie which I likedI liked how they handled Morpheus and Agent Smith I liked the new architect character What could I have lived without The big fight scene was meh I didnt care for the cutesy machine ally but thats being nitpicky All on all I would recommend the movie,Notr
"For a standalone sequel to the original trilogy I was impressed by how complete the movie feltDid it blow my mind No Did it leave me satisfied and entertained YesThis movie was so tongue in cheek that they had to borrow my mouth for extra room They made it obviousvery obvious from the get go that this movie was never supposed to exist For the entire first half of the movie and then some But still managed to make it feel like it belonged in the same reality as the previous films Despite the change in toneIt takes itself less seriously but I thought it workedTldr
Dont go into this movie expecting the same experience as the original But it was a solid movie which I found very entertaining And that expanded the world in some very interesting directions That being said I hope they dont make another one",Notr
This has the feel of a Matrix movie But has a great balance of the old and new I believe the flash backs were great throughout the movie but adding new characters made this feel fresh,Notr
When I was watching this I started with these feelings I recommend you dont do that even though that question is in all of usThat is all i will say,Notr
Only to beat it with a stick and bury it six feet under It was so long and slow Too much talking not enough actionI didnt feel the energy behind what was supposed to be a revival of an iconic storyNeo and Trinity gave off a tired almost senile aura as opposed to the iconic characters I once knew and the entire movie felt like a romance instead of a sci fiactionI do not understand why this movie was made Why did they have to bring Neo and Trinity backAlso this movie rode on the back of the trilogy too much instead of holding up itself the story was overthought and confusing not in a good way If I were you I would skip this and rewatch the original trilogyBrb gonna go cry ,Notr
Without any new visual effects or breakthrough plot the new Matrix relies too heavily on past events and nostalgia Its great to see Neo and Trinity back but all the other bitacting tries to piecemeal a plot line that isnt clear or engaging,Notr
I expected this to be a flop given all of the negative reviews but just give it a chance especially if you liked the philosophy stuff that was jampacked in Reloaded and Revolutions,Notr
Had such high expectations  years on and the technologyspecial effects would be even more amazing  it was so disappointing The fight scenes were blurred and confusing Neo and Trinity nearly pulled it off as actors on their own but with Mr Anderson and Morpheus missing the original actors it just didnt get there I scored the original a   one of the best movies Ive ever seen You would think this was different writers and directors it was that poor,Notr
This is a rip off attempt at the original which was a classic This is an insult to the original movie This is a low budget poorly written and poorly executed attempt at making a movieThis movie stunk so bad it lost me within the first five minutes At ten minutes I left the room It was made for people with no IQ no maturity no sense of quality and no humorAll the characters in the movie are annoyingly terrible people The kids the adults and the extras too They all stinkThe movie attempts with too much effort to try and be funny Everything feels like it is forced and the responses from the actors reading their lines is like watching cardboard cutouts disintegrate in the rain,Notr
Matrix actually is a very good example how to destroy an excellent idea The first movie as we all know was epic  No one of the best movies ever made But the rest including the computer game and anime was really really poor in every possible way So Lana  if you want to cash this in please make the world a favor too and SELL THE RIGHTS OF THE MATRIX FRANCHISE Maybe someone with real vision and good ideas may take it further,Notr
Resurrections was silly shallow constant flashbacks exposition and lacked any magic I was ready to turn it off  mins in The original Matrix is my fav movie saw it in the theater in ,Notr
Too many fake reviews and lies They are giving it a  star and using the same reviews written differently Many of these user reviews only reviewed this film and have no history of reviewing Usernames are generic and followed by numbers Watch it yourself and make your own realistic opinion,Notr
I really expected the bad reviews would be due to comparisons against the first filmI was wrongThis movie was a complete mess and was very obviously made to earn a quick buck Had nothing good in it what so everI wish I had never seen this and ended the triology with the acceptable ending the third film offered,Notr
This was a great movie The people who are giving low ratings and hating on this movie missed the whole concept A story had to be told to make the movie cohesive with what was comingPeople were impatient wanting immediate action instead of following the beginning storyline and were expecting a repeat of the prior sequelsTheres plenty of action if youre patient Understand that a great deal of time has passed and we watch the vulnerability and confusion Neo is dealing with a need to understand hes coming to grips with an environment foreign to his current understanding of reality memories and prior supper abilitiesBe patient enjoy the movie and pay attention to the smaller details,Notr
I absolutely can appreciate that films require a certain amount of suspense of reality but this movie begs you to forget about reason logic plot and what happened in the scene  minutes ago So much was laughably bad throughout I started making a list of things that just didnt make sense but halfway through there was too much to keep track of NPH and Jonathan Groff were INCREDIBLE as always and Yahya AbdulMateen continues to amaze me in the few performances Ive seen him in Save yourself a trip to the theater and if you REALLY want to watch it go for the HBO route so you can pause it while you laugh at how the movie cant remember its own rules,Notr
Hi from FINLAND and I did get the Brandon in there and even I know what it means Whoopsie its not a secret That could not have been a mistake Lost all respect for this franchise for this BS,Notr
Many flaws but its worst sin was to be boring Poor story terrible acting forgettable charactersall can be overlooked It simply cannot be boring as well,Notr
I dont know why ms Vachovski want to make the fourth part of Matrix As for me the story was finished in Revolution Unfortunately the Resurrections is reboot that nobody neededFirstly the scenario is a little bit strange it has a lot of gaps and questions without answers It shows old characters in new world But their decisions are very strange sometimesSecondly the cast good Of course Keanu Reeves and AnnMoss are amazing but others is just doing their jobThirdly the action itself is good but its not awesome how it was in trilogySo its reboot making without any purpose,Notr
Everyone did their job well except the script writersThe movie is missing a soulWas it supposed to be a super hero movieAll these references to today to make the audience feel connected cringeAnd the ending dear Gods Did they imply they might pull another one,Notr
Theres a lot of haters and I dont get it The movie was fun the action was great I enjoyed the story the nostalgia and it was full of great individual performances Its  enjoy the movie,Notr
Abomination thats the first word that comes to mindLets put it plain if me and my crackhead neighbor got really drunk and decided to make a Matrix parody it wouldve been betterNever thought I wont be able to watch a matrix movie to the end but here we are,Notr
Mediocre acting bad storyline and horrible fighting scenes It was like no one was even making an effort Neo looked like on drugs Cant even talk It was like something is in his throat Or like speaking in bass in his voice,Notr
It went in a different direction than I imagined Although it could have ironed out a few things better and it used the battery thing again I still liked it In fact I will watch it again Im not sure if it will hold up with repeat viewing But for now I find it to be a fun ride,Notr
Unlike the massacre thats going on here I think its a good movie Not great not bad but good There is even something to be said about its interesting approach to trauma denial psychosis and delusion Worth a watch,Notr
The only thing more terrifying than seeing Matrix  is the very real possibility of there being a Matrix  at some point in the future something I am definitively not looking forward to after having to sit through the th movieThis movie feels hollow shallow and unnecessarily drawn out The action sequences are completely spoiled by the rapid cuts and closeups of characters faces which feels like a kick in the teeth considering what Matrix did with arguably much more limited technology at the beginning of the centuryI wouldnt be this harsh with my rating but the director has some big boots to fill when picking up such an iconic franchise I believe there to be a lack of comprehension in what made the original Matrix as great as it still is to this day,Notr
Had seen no trailers  i no idea went in with an open mind like a real matrix lover and understander should Loved loved loved it the story the twists the mind boggaling turns it took me back into the Matrix but a litte deeper You must be willing to travel and understand what this is about Sharp as a knive and a stand alione paradoxis it a loop can it be reached  wow  mind blowing basically if you didnt like it you didnt get it or just not ready yet but like the loop showed time will tell  i iwish you the best,Notr
The film is a symbol of the excessive demands of the makers The main thing is to squeeze in as much fancy as possible which then seems farfetched The film also gives no time for images and ideas to take effect Also no tension is created by the hectic paceThe minimalism and precision from the first part is missing There is no Matrix atmosphereAnd if a serious film has to work with jokes then everything is clearWith a series the missing  minutes of explanation could have been sorted out somehow,Notr
After seeing this with my father who saw the trilogy  times now we were both satisfied The action was cool and the plot was intruiging The callbacks to the older movies were also pretty coolNow of course it isnt as good as the first movie none of the sequels are But I believe that this one is as rewatchable as the others,Notr
I still believe The Matrix is one of the most significant films of my lifetime not to mention one of my best theater experiences ever The sequels went awry because they tried to explain EVERYTHING The action vibes and ideas still worked but the details were never the point This particular sequel worked better than the others because it was mostly a trippy fever dream version of The Matrix What was that reflection What does this mean It worked best when I was confused and wondering As a result the first and last thirds were genuinely fun even if the action was muddy the middle third was a bit explainy Overall though pretty fun to hang with Neo and Trinity for a while and forget that rd movie ever happened,Notr
The Matrix Resurrection is the latest blockbuster lean on nostalgia But instead appears only for the sake of nostalgia itself the film dares to challenge and twist the narrative and continuously make it fresh Not as groundbreaking as the original but still giving you a fun ride at the big screenToo bad there are too many expositions and its a little bit annoying The film is also a bit lacking in the action department especially since the great Yuen Wooping isnt involved anymoreJessica Henwick is a revelation,Notr
Rated this a  after the first viewing But just like the nd  rd instalment it takes more than  viewing to appreciate the nuances  humour hidden within Watch it again,Notr
I mean the action is good The story is so all over the place I was left unable to attach myself to any of the characters Its just blah The original is a masterpiece The others wereprogressively worse This could be a nice jumping off point perhaps but the ending made me hope its not Just leave it alone and let it be Maybe come out with some dope Matrix video games with deep story lines I would buy that This left me wishing I went to bed early,Notr
Why do you do it Why Why continue logically sound trilogy What for Do you believe you can fix second and third movie by making a forth one Can you tell me what it is Do you even know,Notr
Morbius is an interesting choice of a character to add to the MCU or Sony SpiderMan Universe especially to have a standalone movie Unlike Venom which has more recognition in general audienceThis is not a bad movie Mediocre at its best Fun action sequences good atmosphere for its genre and characters but again its very basicThe conflict is very predictable and overused Somehow the runtime is too long for what the storyline trying to tell with that being said weirdly some moments still felt rushedNo actual character development no memorable hero moments The cinematography is done well Jared Letos acting is great I just hope it was written better both the dialogue and storylineBut then again with Morbius has a possible appearance in future Marvel Movie especially in MCU Im still intrigued and excited,Notr
I almost didnt see this after hearing so many negative reviews Im glad I did It was as actually pretty good I left the movie theater feeling entertained and thats what I go to the movies for Leto did a fantastic job as Morbius Im looking forward to the addition of the unique character to the Marvel universe and how he will tie in with everyone else Will the movie blow you away No Will it entertain you for a couple of hours Yes,Notr
I expected Howard the duck such was the hate for this movie Instead I got a short dark sometimes quite violent slice of entertainment Not the usual overcomplicated Overlong marvel stuff that all end up being the same Matt Smith and Jared Leno gave excellent performances and the special effects for a medium budget movie were very different but still very good Its a simple origins story and to me I think Jared Leno may be the cause of bad reviewsmaybe because he wasnt the Joker of choice and thats a problem for some people But reviews suggesting this is some kind of disaster turkey are absolutely wrong,Notr
Maybe Im easily pleased but I enjoyed Morbius its not the best Marvel film out there but still very watchable and I never got bored at any time Dont go in expecting an Oscar winner film its just a good action film It definitely doesnt warrant some of the terrible reviews everyone thinks they are filmmakers these days,Notr
This is not your favourite huge budget Marvel movie like No Way Home this is a introductory film of a somewhat niche character and if you compare any comic film to something like No Way Home it will fall flat I went into this with an open mind and I had an enjoyable time Its a different type of Marvel film with dark humour and I enjoyed myself while watching it I am familiar with the character and have read the comics and I was not disappointed with what Leto and Smith respectively brought to their roles I think if you are able to enjoy a film without nitpicking at it then youll have fun with this,Notr
At first I was excited to watch this with my boyfriend because I wanted to torture him for making me watch John Wick for the th time In the end I learned a valuable lesson while seeking revenge dig two graves  one for yourself Thank you MorbiusP S A big shoutout to the rat for being the most believable actor You go little guy Other than the rat being great I really loved how subtle the Casio product placement was,Notr
From all the bad press and reviews I suspect that people were looking for more then it intended to be Seeing it for free on Netflix might have dampened the pain This is not an MCU movie Its trying to be one in the Underworld flair Maybe too much Underworld One of the problems is that Jared Leto cannot carry a movie He needs a stronger lead to work off of When he has that hes more than enough The subtlety of the effects works for me The bad guy Milo was a little too one dimensional and flat Predictable Weak writing in that regard Not enough character development I can see Morbius working in an ensemble MCU cast Hopefully he will be given that chance,Notr
  I dont know what all the fuss is about with this one when the quality matches that of either Venom movie and while I didnt love the visual design of the vampires I thought the cinematography VFX sound design and Adria Arjona who is now on my Actors to Watch list really elevated the relatively weak story,Notr
Truly one of the movies of all time I loved the moment when everyone started the morby and just morbedNo wonder this movie sold  trillion tickets worldwide There should definetly be morbius ,Notr
I dont understand how any human being can rate this movie  stars Even if its the first movie you ever watched and cant compare it to any other movie how can you think its excellent movie The acting is terrible the animations are amateurish the plot is predictable and boring and some of it also makes no sense It was a complete waste of my time I was amaze to discover that the movie as a connection to marvel and to spiderman worldI hope for the good of all humanity they dont make a sequel I will support World War III just to prevent it Everyone associated with the film should feel embarrassed,Notr
Solid  Will be better if they make Rated R but not bad leto was good,Notr
I think its time for Sony to accept that they arent very good at making superhero films Just leave it to Marvel and everyone will be happy This movie sucked,Notr
This movie is definitely not as bad as the critics have rated it Its nothing amazing but its not horrible either Storyline was very predictable but far better then most cheesy crap that comes out Id give it a  nothing amazing but slightly better then average,Notr
No surprises this was awful Jared Leto is terrible and Matt Smith was annoying CGI was laughingly bad and the slowmo action and wonky editing made things borderline unwatchable Writing was all over the place too with some terrible dialogue Theres little fun and it took itself way too seriously Honestly this made Venom seem alright in comparison,Notr
Ok so its no classic but its not that bad Enjoyable enough to watch if you take it for what it is The effects are good The story is a little basic but like I say its ok The worse thing about the film is what comes after it the post credit scenes two of them just dont make sense and felt really hurried,Notr
The movie is Dull Nothing happens when it happens it is dumb and makes no sense The plot is full of convenience where people are in some place just for happening For example the Morbius boat is full of armed guards just to have some action scene thereAction scenes are short and full of blurred colored effects or dark effects and none of them workUninteresting characters You have Morbius a new made vampire that needs to drink human blood to live You could explore this in so many ways like trying to drink blood from animals buying blood from blood bank and making needing people dying because lack of blood packs leading to I will drink blood from bad people But they decided that trowing a blurred colored ball is more interesting Side characters are empty as wellThis movie is so boring that is more enjoyable to do the dishes,Notr
As many have written here the hate is superbly unfair and it doesnt do the movie nor the production team justiceWhen that is said I understand some of the fair bad critics Many things couldve been improved But the story the CGI the action and clearly the vibe are all good and nice done Especially the CGIThe major fail is the timeline and this whole thing where they try to connect the dots in a weirdconfusing way I was baffled a few times on what the heck was going on obviously I understood it but it was oddJared Leto did an OK job considering that Im not a fan of his movies and Im someone who hated his Joker in Suicide Squad Otherwise all the other actors were doing okI see what Sony is doing and I wanna say this Dear Sony LISTEN TO MARVEL And stop trying to act like you got it You dont Marvel knows better Trust meAll in all considered the movie deserves a Enjoy it,Notr
The cast is nice even tho jared leto is to my mind not the best choice for the main actor lot of money and ambitions  worst producers  poor unoriginal special effects and a lot of extremely stupid details in the plot Such a shame Sony,Notr
Much like venom it seems people are going to either love or hate anything from the Sonyverse Some hate it because its not in the MCU and still uses characters from the MCU spiderverse Some love it for its more dark delivery and darker comedy I actually enjoy what Sony is doing by making movies for the more vicious anti heroes while making them grounded for the most part The MCU rarely touches on those important details Morbius is very much like the first venom in its set up Gives a nice origin story with some intriguing body horror and more gruesome than normal imagery for a comic book film Definitely has some scattered plot pieces but its serviceable Also leaves more room for expansion in the world if the Sonyverse Leto was great imo and still proves hes a fantastic actor Visuals are very effective and vibrant Overall the film is what I expected and it was solid,Notr
My life wouldve been way better if i didnt see this movie The end credit scenes made no sense and i hatr what sonys trying to do here with their own multiverse,Notr
A vampire film without blood That says it all And it clearly shows that the film has been poorly thought since the start Not to mention that the character is probably one of the most unknown and uninteresting comic book characters,Notr
Perhaps the best movie I have ever seen Beautiful cinematography sharp writing deep character progression and most importantly a masterclass of acting Morbius is a brilliant concoction of all of the cornerstones of filmmaking If you have not seen Morbius  you are a loser and  you should go see MorbiusIts MORBIN TIME,Notr
MorbiusOverall it was GoodI expected so much more but basically it was an origin story for a vampire Well get real how many vampire movies have I seen from Dracula to Twilight and What They Do In The Shadows I know every nuance about vampire life and yet here the movie presumed we knew nothingJust as the movie was starting to flag in came adult Milo played by Matt Smith he dominated the screen and the stark contrast between the method style of acting and Thespianism could not have been more noticeable It was greatTo me the jury is out on Jared Leto he has the look but not the charisma he was proficient in this role but nothing more than thatI really enjoyed the CGI and the way Jared moved flew glided and transformed the rest was unremarkableIm giving this a firm  outta  it was well worth a watch even if in conclusion it was quite a mundane origin story,Notr
TLDR Save yourself the trouble and time and watch something anything elseAnyone who can make vampires this boring and uninteresting should never be allowed to make another movie ever againI was so bored with this half way thru the movie that I didnt even bother pausing any more when I needed a drink or bathroom break A total yawn fest with nothing even remotely worth praisingI have watched many vampire movies from all decades and I cannot recall one of them that made me want to stop watching as much as this one Even the story was boring I simply cannot think of one good thing at all to say about this movie,Notr
This movie is way better than I expected it to be and i do blame Sonys marketing for that they didnt really do things to get me hyped and with all the delays and all they couldve do it betterBut besides that the pov camera standpoint is truly a joy to watch and probably with the fight scenes the best thing about this movieThe Storyline how ever isnt really believable and im not taking about a man turning into a vampire and all no im more going towards the relationships and the way the script evolves during the runtime of the movieAlso  after credit scenes,Notr
Thats it thats my reviewNo seriously I had never cringed so much on my life while watching a movie Morbius is a long boring movie with a very weak plot and clich action scenes with some of the most disappointing special effects of  If you havent slept well in a while then this is your movie,Notr
This movie is a good entertaining movie probably not the best movie but i enjoyed watching it I love how we can see the whole story behind morbius as he evolved Just consider it a fun sony movie and ignore that marvel logo Plus a pretty post credits scene ,Notr
I wasnt expecting a masterpiece but this movie was pretty cool popcorn action vampire movie I actually liked this better then the venom movies but overall it was enjoyable ,Notr
ITS MORBIN TIMEEEEEE MORBABY Sometimes you must morb even when morbin could result in a morbastic morb I think we have all morbed some time in our lives and with this morbapiece we wont have to worry about it again What am I doing with my life,Notr
I was going to review this as  but after the part where morbius himself said Its Morbin Time i immediatly Morbed EVERYWHERE and had to give this ,Notr
Well movie start with a good note and it keeps you gripping throughout the time Action sequences are mindblowing specially the vfx are actually very better Jared Leto was so perfect in Morbius role as well as the other cast perfoms well Story was simple not that great but it gives you a different vibe as compare to other scifi films Its a onetime watch if you like scifi superhero filmsYou can definitely enjoy once,Notr
At the request of a friend I went to the cinema with him to watch this movie because we both love vampires and the horror genre What did we watch This vampire film is almost without visible blood and what little is seen is black while the only red blood is in medical bags that are given for transfusion like wtf Next I would describe this film as  super ultra fast action because Morbius is moving so fast that the shots can barely catch it Oh yes did I mention that as Morbius the vampire moves and flies he leaves behind a trace of color like say a character in a fortnite  Wtf Oh yes and the movie has the dumbest ending ever outrageously shortened When the movie ended I couldnt believe it I felt like I was watching a cheap first episode of the series and I expected to watch the next episode right away Bypass this abomination in film art,Notr
Its shot sooo dark its impossible to tell whats going on or what happens The fighting was impossible to see anything The echo location was cool and Matt Smith was the best part of the movie When he was calling out for Michael to come out and play it was absolutely Demonic sounding Find the cheapest way to see this movie and dont waste your time,Notr
Do not listen to the critics or bad reviews this is a good movie I recommend seeing this movie the movie has gotten a lot of hate but it doesnt deserve it I only wish the movie was a little longer,Notr
Honestly was the reading the Critics reviews saying how bad the film was Wasnt even that bad the CGI wasnt even that bad either Jared Letos performance for someone who is suffering a progressive blood disorder seems rather on point where as critics saying is was a dull performance which doesnt make sense at all the story seemed like it was made for something to be built up to in the future This film doesnt seem like it was made to be a one time outstanding amazing film it felt more like a good solid film that you could rewatch and that its building up to something bigger My opinion would be ignore the critics go watch the film yourself watch the to midcredit scenes and make up your own mind,Notr
People were already prepared to hate this film so just low rated it  its a decent CBM  trust me Sony has done far worseI have to hit  characters apparently,Notr
First and foremost Hollywood needs to stop casting Jared Leto in superhero movies He is not a multifaceted actor with the depth to take on such rolesMorbius as a film was a mess The characters were bland the special effects were atrociously poor the slow motion action scenes were blatantly unnecessary and only added to its watered down runtime This could have been a well made movie had it been done by a different director with a more definitive thought out vision and a better lead actor As it currently stands Morbius is undoubtedly the worst film in its cinematic universe,Notr
I enjoyed the movie I also thought Letto did well  things Its an origin story of a character that hasnt been in another movies so far I think that given a sequel it could only get better because all the basic character development would be out of the way Its a vampire movie not a marvel movie and I feel like that threw people off Its different Its hard to stand out when youre released so close to movies like SpiderMan Venom  and Batman I think this could be a tortoise and the hare thing,Notr
Below average but far from the worst Better than the first Suicide Squad on the level with Thor Dark WorldEternalsDont expect anything thought provoking just mindless entertainment,Notr
The people who rated this  are out of their minds and blinded by fandom This is easily one of the worst movies in the Marvel catalog  possibly the absolute worst Sony does not know how to make good movies and people seriously need to stop rewarding them for this garbage If you keep throwing money at them for any trash they put out thats all youll ever get  trash,Notr
Morbius is a well made film Unlike the reviews which completely put down the movie I believe that it was enjoyable I am not a Marvel Fan and have never read the comicsI enjoyed the good graphics face design and design of Morbiuss powers and how they are visualisedThe film had no negatives but lacked a wow factor that would make it I have noticed though that the story felt like it had an abrupt ending The goal of the main protagonist doesnt appear to be realised its just that a fight has been wonIt felt like given  minutes more of screentime the story could have been taken to a better place,Notr
How in gods glorious kingdom was this movie green lighted Ive seen better plots on CornHub Nothing about this movie says Marvel in literally any way as its overdone CGI non existent story line and overall boring premise reminds me more of an Ernest movie than anything else Who did they think would like this Its slop Cinematic slop What kind of suicidal thoughts are these poor MCU writers having to make them write this It feels like one of those writing exercises where you just dont stop writing until you have a page and thats your story premise However most people edit them or just dont use them if theyre bad Marvel clearly hired a stoner to write this movie I cant say enough times how unbelievably bad the plot of this movie is The story makes no sense isnt given enough context things just happen for literally no reason and the characters are about as unique as a can of creamed corn from Nazi Germany,Notr
Bad Bad plot bad character development bad pace bad cinematography bad fights no emotional connection no stakes not confidentLeto and Smith try their best but there is not a lot to work with here  good scenes back to back hospital and prison not fantastic but at least were kind of cool and let you interested hoping for the best The best never came,Notr
This is the type of movie that makes you wonder how a movie studio can mess things so badThe film looks like it was written by a  year oldEvery Sony  Marvel movie feels like it was produced by executives with absolutely no knowledge about the source material character development nor basic narrative trying to implement in a movie what they shallowly believe people wantSony should sell all these characters rights to Marvel and thats it,Notr
Rewatched it and this movie sucked After watching it a second time I know why everyone hated this movie It just dragged the whole time I dont know what I was thinking thinking it was good so Im glad I rewatched it Because it was bad,Notr
Im genuinely so tired of studios like Sony churning out lackluster products and still expecting it to be a success cause its attached to a popular brand Do better,Notr
I like the character Morbius his powers are cool Hed be a really cool hero to have at your side He should have his own mini team like the avengersMy friends say it needed more character development and more of a story to it I persoanlly think they did develop the characters and story fairly well but yes they could have done with a little more You dont want the movie to be too long but I think another  mins of story building built up from another  or  mins here and there would have done itI liked the main female character it would have been  would be nice to see their love story develop a little moreI dont like the person he met in cut scene wtf I dont like where thats goingOverall I really enjoyed itCGI was great u cant do a movie like that without lots of CGI ,Notr
Let me start off by saying this movie has some flawsThe villain has a very confusing motivation it was rushed it can be cringey at times and it is predictable that is why it is a  and not a  If you can look past this though you will see an interesting story about a man and his friend who suffered from a blood disease his entire life and just wanted to be cured When he takes the cure and it has side effects that are horrible he decides his friend would be better off the way his friend is for now I would even say it is kind of sad,Notr
Morbius is definitely a movie the most Marvel movie ever made Perhaps one of the movies of all time I really this movie it was very This movie is very when youre watching it I surely this,Notr
They could have at least gotten someone with a highschool education to read or check the script Absolute garbage all the way through How can so many highlypaid people invest so much money into trash like this and think Yeah this is a high quality thing that people will like,Notr
I honestly dont understand the hate directed towards this movie Its not going to win an Oscar but who expected that anyway You all know the story from the other reviews I just came here to say if you want an entertaining enough action flick then this is worth watching,Notr
This is a classic superhero movie It really gets to the audience and I give a it a solid rating as to it had a great story development and background into the characters  it wasnt flashy like many people expect it was quite to the point and with great scenes and good cinematography and VFX I agree as its in a dark setting couldnt have been many peoples favorite but I promise its better that just the flashy superhero I hope they use Jared Leto in Marvel ahead Hes a really good actor,Notr
One morbilion stars i will watch it on morbilion times grapei recomd everyone watching it morbius was veryily handsome as bat infected villani wonder somethimes how this will effect the socioeconim climate as one morbillion ticket has beens Sold,Notr
"The acting is good
sfx is great
camera work is greatMain story is lazy because its very easy to anticipate how the plot develops and there is no big surprises I also suspect some heavy editing has been going on Never the less the movie does indeed manage to be entertainingThe morbius character has potential if they are allowed to make more It need more gore and more uneasy scenes to fully plunge people into the universe of morbius some jump scares and a little compelling side plot and we are all setSo if you are into these kind of movies its easily a small  compared to other marvel movies",Notr
If you enjoy reading my SpoilerFree thoughts please follow my blog to read my full review Morbius is yet another disaster from the SonyMarvel shared universeDespite good performances from Jared Leto and Matt Smith and even a couple of visually captivating action sequences the formulaic screenplay that seems to originate from the beginning of the century ruins everything in its pathFrom the predictability and zero creativity of the main plot to the heavy reliance on uninteresting unnecessary exposition Daniel Espinosa finds his most significant problem in the blatant lack of care in the treatment of the charactersThe narrative logical lapses are too many to ignore and even amplified by extremely messy editing a third act wrapped in an unfathomable blend of CGI and a plagiarized scoreOne of the most embarrassing productions by a major studio in recent yearsRating D,Notr
Thank you for everyone who made this movie i got a good laugh watching the horrible acting stupid plot and teenagerich CG That moment when jared riding the train wind is priceless i choked on my drink,Notr
Honestly I liked it It just felt so rushed that I could never have an emotional attachment to anything or anyone If they took an extra  minutes to let the story naturally progress instead of just hurrying it along as fast as they could it wouldve been better,Notr
The movie seemed highly rushed and short we didnt get enough exposition or time to get to know any of the characters and they had too many meta jokes that were cringe and the dialogue was laughable at times This movie was disappointing and couldve been executed better,Notr
Morbius is the movie Ive ever seen Apparently Morbius was the very first movie ever I watched this movie and I thought this sure is the movie that I have seen of all time If I were to say one thing about this movie it would be that this movie,Notr
 leaves an obnoxious and nauseous smell no method in the madness confused congealed badness put it away close the door do not dwell and turn the lights off on the way out,Notr
I love Morbius and thought the movie did a good job introducing the character and his abilities My only issue is the main villain was lack luster Needed a more cinematic blockbusteresque villain to finish the movie with Otherwise it was good,Notr
Morbius is a well done Entertaining Marvel film  And Best of All the Multiverse Madness is linked to Morbius film as well  If U R a True Marvel Universe fan  then its a must for U to see it  And the Villian is elevates the film  Jared Leto once again shows his Star power ,Notr
Jared Letto has failed me again with his attempts in playing anti heroes like Joker and Morbius Well to be fair this time it isnt his fault This movie lacked in storyline character development and formidable villain I can tell who the villain was gonna be just few minutes into the movie The final fight was underwhelming and just a lazy setup for sequel,Notr
Jared Letto is a chameleon He did a great job with the Joker and now with Morbius I am not a vampire fan but this movie was so well done it won me over Went with  other fanboys and we all give it a big thumbs up The story was one that hasnt been told before They didnt try to make the monster a hero like they did in VENOM They showed him with all his warts and evil desires The Keaton scene was confusing Overall a fun ride we all enjoyed Looking forward to the next chapter,Notr
I didnt HATE it But I cant give it a passI feel we should have moved past this point in the Superhero genre The story did nothing that hasnt been done better elsewhereSony is still trying to work out this game Which is odd given how well they stared out the gate with SpiderMan and SpiderMan But since those two they havent been able to find a film that has completely knocked it out of the park without Marvel Studios involvement The Amazing SpiderMan had good bits and Venom was fun but Morbius experience came across as a choreI thought Jared Leto wasnt bad and actually held himself back a bit unlike say Tom Hardy who went all out with Venom Matt Smith looked like he was having fun alsoVisuals were patchy but had some interesting parts While the end credit scenes detracted from an already disappointing storySony dont miss you chances You may only have one left,Notr
I was expecting this film to be bad Mostly because of the memes But those aside I wanted to watch it for the same reason I do all marvel films Because im the type of demograhpic for it I have to say though I was plesently surprised This film was enjoyable all the way through and had action and such that kept it going well I feel though the cgi for the faces couldve been better but that aside it was not half bad Everyones favourite vampire plays morbius Jared leto Having previouse played joker in the rival studios film he was more enjoyable in this and took on the role well Milo his friend is played by matt smith who I also enjoyed Martine played by adria arjona was also someone that I thought was ok and I like the possibility of a sequal to this movie Overall pretty good,Notr
"In my opinion this movie is not nearly as bad as people say it is but that being said this movie is far from perfect Now I give it a  and not as low as others because I think this is an enjoyable movie and would watch again On the other hand this movie goes by SUPER quick and feels extremely rushed and wish it gave characters time so that you could care about them and by the end of the movie and you rlly dont And not going to go into spoliers but wtf is that mid credit scene  I truly think that sony should let Kevin Fiege help with this universe fr So including the  venom films heres my ranking Venom let there be carnage
 Morbius
 Venom
So go see Morbius if you want a fun movie with some flaws and dont believe all the reviews and check it out for yourself",Notr
Morbius is a clear example of what a bad movie is The script is pretty bad full of narrative plots The acting is pretty bad the direction seems nonexistent and worst of all are the special effects The only redeeming thing about this movie is the cinematography which is decent,Notr
Not that bad not a great hype Sonys spiderverse is moving in other way of MCU but a future crossroad will be a better show to watch A bet for the mature era of Spiderman storytelling,Notr
Morbius has good special effects and the acting was ok The story on the other hand is nothing more than an origin story that is unlikeable Blade is a million times better than this due yourself a favor and watch a rerun of blade,Notr
WHAT A MOVIE The dialogue was beautiful and the story was just absolutely fantastic Ive never seen such a voluptuous portrayal of characters The directing was splendid and dont even get me started on the acting The acting was so great I almost thought everything was real Do not get me wrong I know the public doesnt agree with my opinion But if they would just give it a chance they would see that it is actually a st century masterpiece If I could bring back the founding fathers from the dead and show them one thing from present day media I would show them this movie And let me tell you if Washington and I laid back in some reclining seats slammed a couple of bud lights and munched on some heart attack popcorn it would be the most important thing to happen since the the birth of Jay Sean,Notr
I really dont know what is wrong with all the people rating this movie so low I dont know of many perfect movies out there For one you have to have an open mind and stop comparing this movie to that movie or to this or that comic and just sit back relax and enjoy the movieWhen you think to much you can tear anything apart and ruin it Yes I saw some things I would have done differently but all in all it wasnt a bad movie there are many out there that are way worse trust me,Notr
Have you noticed a trend yet Movies will continue to be horrible for the next several years until Hollywood figures itself out They are no longer hiring people based on their abilitiesTo learn more go read Bari Weiss article Hollywoods new rules,Notr
SeriouslyAn entire movie about exposition instead of entertainmentWho edited thisWhat a total cock upGet someone else in to edit the dailies into an entertaining movieWhat a wasted opportunity Youve spent the money you have the footage you forgot to engage the audience in a compelling storyBoo hoo agonise over a really really basic ethical dilemma for the entire fracking movieMore interested in the sequel setup than an engaging storyBoring boo hoo agonising over and over Just tell a fracking story without  hours of agonising over justification for a non existent antiheroGive Morbius a purpose other than sooking over his existence Boring boring boring,Notr
Morbius was by no means any masterpiece It was pretty forgettable over all especially the action sequences which isnt a good sign for an action movie and throughout things just happened with no to very little build up and the few characters we had got very little in terms of development or explaining their relationships and then it just kinda ended without me being ready for itThat said I was never really bored in the theatre It was an interesting enough premise I understood the motivations and it kept a pretty straight line throughout None of these actors are gonna win any Oscars for their work on this movie but unlike some others I had no problem with any performance Over all an OK night at the theatre and I would rather rewatch this than anything DisneyMarvel had put out post Far from home except No Way Home and even that isnt super good IMO its just special to watch because of all the returning actors Try to pitch that movie but have every returning character from the other universes be played by different people youd end up with something properly stupid,Notr
I went into this movie with an open mind but somewhat was expecting the worstThe movie genuinely isnt as bad as the press made it out to beWhere is shines is its unique was of doing action sequences that rival bullet timeFlashtime The atmosphere they bring together is definitely top notch and the style some of the shots are filmed in are greatWhere this movie definitely falls short is its predictable villainplot line lack of real character development and overall character motivations that feel week By the end of it you barely remember anyones name or purpose They are written so minimally and dulllike that by the end of it you end up not really caring that much for them Also the movie has terribly slow pacing to the point I wouldnt be shocked if you fell asleep watching the filmOverall I thought they did a decent job at bringing Morbius to the big screen even if the plot feels like it was phoned in,Notr
Sony once again steps into the Marvel Universe running the experience and canonicity that Marvel and its movies have been preparing and perfecting for years now The films director even spoiled info from the movie prior to the release and admitted that most of the Easter eggs we see in the trailers were simply just ClickBait Enough is enough as long as people continue to see and support movies like this Studios will continue to trample on the art and visions that fans know and love Dont support SonyMarvel Movies,Notr
Morbius is the bst movie It has stunning visusals engaging plot and terrific acting from jarod elto When i watched morbis i was encapsulated by the relationship between micheal morbius morbius and the chick who he really liked When,Notr
So many troll reviews professional and just regular peepsseems like this was gonna have bad reviews no matter whAt before it even came outdragged my  year old who was kicking and screaming about not ever wanting to see it we saw it he liked it  I liked it kinda fun movie winning awardsoh of course not but on a Tuesday night in April a solid fun movie ,Notr
Keeping it short this was very poorly written and directed Seems more like an episode of something rather than a film and not sure it warrants a sequel that will still surely happen Leto was actually very good and well cast but had very little substance to work with,Notr
The best movie everNo wonder it sold more than one morbillion ticketsI especially liked the scene where Morbius said its morbin time or Lets morb it just show how well written the whole movie isAnd the cgi is perfect you cant tell if this morbius is cg or Jared Leto actually became a vampire,Notr
Ill preface this by saying Im not a massive Marvel fan nor am I usually into vampire movieshorrors etc However I had my arm twisted to go and watch this oneI have absolutely no idea why this is getting such low average ratings its currently on  The movie is enjoyable from start to finish the CGI and action sequences are of a good quality and the script is well writtenHonestly  ignore the negative reviews go in with an open mind and youll enjoy the film,Notr
I honestly expected the movie to be horrible and it was Bot only was the story just plain boring but the post credit scene made no sense at allHonestly this is a huge stepdown from venom Venom was a alright franchise and the fact this movie was SO bad makes me loose all hope for future movies like kraven the hunter This film is bad and for sure a passDo not see it no matter what,Notr
After reading the reviews and knowing how many times they postponed the opening I didnt expect too much However I was pleasantly surprised Special effects are cool and the story moves nicely It didnt try to be funny like VENOM did but it was able to find a nice groove End of credit scenes are terrible Make absolutely no sense Most likely they were added by some moronic Sony exec Ignoring the end of credit scenes the entire movie was fun And Im hoping they do the sequel soon,Notr
I dont know what people were expecting from this movie but it is nowhere near as bad as people are saying or even bad for that matter Its a fun one and a half hour vampire movie with a simple plot Michael Morbius is a likable character that grows up with a blood disease that makes physical life a pain Hes a genius despite all this Good action sequences and fun Watch yourself,Notr
"This movie could have been way better it had a great potential Im not gonna talk about the negative side of this movieLets talk about the good stuff
This movie has a great visual effect great motion perfect timing for the slow motion and the accelerated motion the colors everything But what really shocked me was the closing credits or end credits list of the cast and crew of a particular motion picture not the post credit scenes the visual effects in those closing credits were AMAZING I cant express how much an amazing experience those closing credits were for the first time in my life I didnt want them to endFinally the post credit scene not to spoil anything Im just gonna say they were great opening the door for something special",Notr
Ok visually but isnt this just the same old story nowGuy takes a formula Guy gets powers Has to deal with rival with powers Learns to live with itThe final showdown was left wantingIt just didnt enthuseMatt Smith looked like he has some fun at least x post credit scenes to try to encourage a sequal  I cant see myself getting excited about that,Notr
I dont know how successful the MCU era is that they are willing to make a movie that costs nearly  million dollars and has such bad quality If Morbius wasnt a Marvel character in the MCU era I dont think many people would have paid to see the movie if they knew it was this bad We get to see a few CGI fight scenes and while the color scheme of most of the important scenes is too dark and hard to see I found myself unimpressed by the fake smoke that billows behind Morbius and Milo Wheres that smoke coming from Is something burning A movie with a shallow story and lifeless dialogue disconnected scenes bland characters and no message Look at Jareds expression he looks too naive and innocent for this role Maybe he should have focused on changing the muscles in his face instead of his body I dont know what Vulture is here for but from the trailer he seems to be a bait to get money from people,Notr
I didnt know this had anything to with marvel so no expectations on the whole this is a good movie with interesting story I love vampire movies an this hit the spot okay there wasnt head ripping or blood everywhere but okay scenes I think it should have a better rating I think if it wasnt connected with marvel then it would have done better I would much rather watch this than spiderman or something because this was little darker and just more my type of movie I have to say there is kind of a batman feel obviously because of the bats I would like to see more of Morbius as series or movie,Notr
This may just be the worst movie of  Poorly done CGI aside the writing is bland the characters have little to no character development and the pacing goes from breakneck to nonexistent The plot if you can even call it that barely exists That and whenever this movie isnt so bad its funny this movie commits the worst crime of all that being its so boring to sit through With the addition of the aforementioned poorly done CGI things go from bad to worse as if you ask me a good superhero movie typically relies on two things Visuals and plot And if those two elements are poorly done the movie is poorly done,Notr
I dont think theres much I can say about this movie that hasnt already been saidEverything from plot points to character motives to Morbius powers are so unexplained I was lost literally  minutes in and it only got worse with every sceneIts so thrown together it doesnt even feel like a real movieThe film leaves you scratching your head for its entire run time and then just ends in the most abrupt way Ive ever seen Its like the final act of the film was never filmedAnd with that everything that looked cool about the movie was cut Vulture narrated the trailer and hes basically not in the film Jokes are left literally incompleteNo part of this movie is memorable other than what has already been memed to deathPlus the end credits scenes are so insanely illogical and near canon breakingAs someone who was actually excited for this movie I am not just incredibly disappointed but Ive lost all hope in the Venomverse,Notr
This movie is well ok Because if its lack of story and the action is Acceptable I give it  stars I feel like marvelor Sony is just trying to add more Villains for spiderman to have The acting is decent The cgi can get a bit shakey at some points but other than that it is ok The story moves very quickly and I felt like I was just thrown into a scenario that I had no background knowledge of Some good things about this movie though is the final battle Which has decent cgi but still it was kinda disappointing The thing that made me want to see more was the ending But yeah This movie gets  stars out of ,Notr
The beginning was ok even interesting bonding somehow The middle was interesting even though foreseeable but the ending sucks The last  minutes destroyed the whole movie Packed with overthetopaction and in consequence boring somehow A movie which is exchangeable to many other movies by its qualities In the last  minutes it looked like they wouldnt know how to end it and stuff it with action to make an excuse of it After that the last cheesy parts were unbearable No I dont like that Im a Marvel fan and was in a rush in the MCU by phase  which had a pretty awesome peak in Avengers Endgame I also like the Marvel TVseries at least most of them But this movie is dull,Notr
Never really been much of a Marvel fan more of a D C buff still anything with a horror twist or spin of an antihero had me to check it out and Morbius fit that bill The character who first made his appearance in Spiderman comics then later had his own series run and with this film starring Jared Leto is nothing great still its a watch for comics and vampire fans Jared Leto is Michael Morbius a biochemist who is always working on the latest medical discoveries and all of a sudden his life changes when he is affected by some rare blood Now we see a man with fangs and claws and a guy with super special powers Overall okay marvel comics film hopefully they can make sequels and have the Morbius character appear more in the Marvel universe world of movies,Notr
As my title says theres a  reason why every movie which should be rated R and is not wont be as successful as it couldve been otherwise Imagine the latest Joker without RWith Morbius everyone expected a level of production over Underworld  Evolution  but as we know nowdays its impossible for a studio like Marvel to make such prolonged production with much more technical resources than just CGII think most of fans of Marvels Morbius are long matured but they got a movie for kids Also the vampire theme is old enough and it shouldve delivered something surprising,Notr
Im not sure why there is so much hate Its definitely a darker Marvel movie Everyone did a good job in it and I think the two leads were well cast There were a few plot holes but the graphics and camera angles were awesome It was a good origin story,Notr
How is this only rated a  This is a good film good plot great special effects Jared Leto playing a good role for once that isnt the Joker because he did a cp job at that and Matt Smith who is great at everything This film has an interesting bad guy no spoilers a compelling story and a hugely famous cast not sure why everyone is giving it a bad rep but as far as Marvel is concerned especially Thor Love and Thunder This is a solid film Plus if you like horror this touches on that and then gets into more of an action film All in all its a good film and Id happily watch it again,Notr
"Compared to his Joker this is not goodThis page needs  charactersbefore submissionSee this film for Your self
In my mind not worth watching but to others could be good thats my opinion",Notr
Morbius has brief moments of quality and good ideas but they are ultimately not enough to elevate a weak origin story for its title character that feels rushed with plenty of pointless elements lazy writing and a pair of laughably bad end credits scenes so embarrassing they bring the whole film down a couple of pointsJared Leto gives a reasonably charismatic lead performance with a few good jokes but can only do so much with a bland character and overall lack of emotional heft Matt Smith on the other hand is easily the sole standout element completely over the top and clearly enjoying it with a dance Bully Maguire would be proud ofThe CG is extremely messy and distracting especially in the final fight which is almost completely incomprehensible The action overall is competently shot but lacks any real weight or impact Its made worse by a lack of blood and an over reliance on slow motion that makes the whole thing feel a decade old on arrival,Notr
Masterpiece  a must see I wonder how can some reviewers give it a low score every moment or the movie is well articulated you enjoy each and every scene the actors are phenomenal Jared deserves an Oscar for his performance,Notr
Only really watched Morbius because its connected with Spiderman I didnt have much interest and knew it was going to be bad from the trailers But just how bad is it Well its really just a whole lot of nothingWeve seen this story a hundred times by now Mad scientist experiments on themself and ends up with superpowers But not just superpowers Vampire powersIts basically a combination of all the superhero and Vampire movies weve already seen Except with terrible action scenes that you cant make out for all the bats and rubble that are in the way As well as repetitive use of annoying slow motion and peoples faces quickly morphing into a Vampire face mid sentance Just to remind you that the film isnt boring Theres even a forced unnecessary romance in there for no reasonIt could of at least been average and is almost saved by the decent villian But then theres those tacked on midcredit scenes that just remind you this is all one big con to get you back into the cinema next time Watching something that should have Spiderman in it but doesnt,Notr
It truly shows how little effort went into designing the plot when everything that could be badly written is The main plot the main and side characters the ending the obvious cliches for bad and good the dialogues Even the after credit scenes How do you even manage to do that badI wanted to see it to understand the memes and now I do It is bad with or without famous actors on the leads Cover crap in golden foil and itll still be crap I guessIts as if someone used ChatGPT to get an idea of a movie about a vampire and just went along with whatever came firstHell maybe even ChatGPT could have done better,Notr
Its not that bad tbh maybe cause my expectation was super low and bad like I expect  and after I watch it it was not that bad it was ok but for me its kinda boring in the middle of the movie but ya the movie is still bad I love the VFX but I dont really like the slow mo in this movie it was like to much The acting was good but the story was to fast like they not explaining some scene like how morbius can fly at first he can fly cause theres train but in the final he was flying to find martine like how But ya the movie Credit scene was quite surprising me,Notr
Personally not a big fan of Leto myself however the trailer looked dark for Marvel so it got me curious Went in with no expectations and to be honest the movie was really enjoyable By no means it is a masterpiece but the action scenes were fun and overall make up of the beast was quite terrifying Pleasantly surprised leave your biased opinions at home and just watch it for what it is and Im sure youll enjoy it Big plus that its under  hours so it didnt drag anything out Great length good action scenes and open ending Nothing to complain about other than maybe Id love a few more action scenes Watching how the creature moves and fights is different from what Ive seen in any other movie so would definitely have loved to see more of that,Notr
One of my favorite Marvel characters SpiderMans favorite antagonist to me I thought the movie was good not great but just fine and it sets up for future appearances of Morbius I would say the movie was slightly better than Venom I thought Morbius was played very well by Jerod Leto So is it worth watching The short answer is yes,Notr
I Love Morbius  I enjoyed Morbius  I like Matt smith Cast member who played Milo in Morbius  This movie is Morbelous Morbius is wow I went to the cinema  times today to see Morbius I watched Morbius Very nice i said I just watched Morbius  Highly reccomend looking forward to future Morbius Cinematic Universe ventures,Notr
This movie is truly the best film off all time I watched it so much I ended up morbing my pants I remember morbing on other people at the theater where people sat on each others laps so they could fit in the theater to watch the film I cried when it ended but my tears of self completion were unheard behind the thunderous applause of everyone within a  mile radius I had this movie playing at my wedding and I intend to play it at my funeral no wonder this movie won best picture at the academy awards for  consecutive years This is the best film ever if anyone says different they FAKE I envy the people who have never seen it as I wish to watch it for the first time again it felt like losing my virginity in my eyes and ears Enjoy this movie embrace it love it closer than your family and finally feel like you have to do nothing more in life,Notr
Nowhere Near as bad as most people are saying it isJared Leto puts in a Solid Performance Matt Smith is absolutely Great in thisAdria Arjona Is so Hot Oh Boy The  police officers were funny at times Holy Water Some of the Special effects looked AwesomeShould of expanded on the story more thoughThe Nobel Prize scene shows you that they could of added more here and there to this storyHowever This Movie does supply you with enough to leave you wanting more Will be definitely looking out for the SequelThe Pacing was absolutely Perfect,Notr
Would have been a good movie if the director and writers were fired and it was allowed to be rated R And they wonder why people dont want to go to the theaters to watch a poorly made movie for  This movie would have been nothing without Matt Smith and Jared Leto to hold up the story line The inconsistencies and poor writing permeate the story extremely well Its a shame the character and plot development werent given the same care Im pretty sure there were additional scenes but just didnt make the cut for whatever reason One of the best parts of the movie was after the credits rolled,Notr
Theres a moment in the film where there is music playing and the guy singing keeps saying have sex and honestly he is right I should be doing that instead of watching this nonsensical garbage,Notr
I imagine the very low rating has to do more with peoples hate obsession with Jared letos  minutes as the joker than the actual movie It isnt bad especially for an mcu movie Not saying its anything special but its nice that it is a little different like people actually die like a comic book lolIt is short for an mcu movie so it feels like it may have been rushed but I dont think thats a bad thing If they dragged it out I would have rated it lowerI say watch it For the better part of mcu being done and the new stuff lately pretty much sucks this is actually one of the best Thats the end of my Ted talk so now down vote this lol,Notr
This movie aint horrible but aint great Its just there This movie is quite predictable where Michael Morbius Jared Leto argues then later fights his best friend Milo Matt Smith because Morbius doesnt want to be a vampire hybrid while Milo accepts the affects of the serum Very cliche and predictable,Notr
Its by far better than the first hrs felt like hrs of the avengers endgame Which was really slow and boring Great performance by Jared Leto Not too impressed by Matt Smiths performance to be honest Very enjoyable Im beginning to think that alot of critics are paid by Disney to give their own produced shows and movies great reviews Even when theyre terrible But those same critics give shows and films bad reviews that dont deserve it Like halo and morbius I for one am glad I went to the cinema to see it Unlike endgame hrs Ill never get back In short Dont go by dodgy critic reviews If you like the trailer and the synopsis sounds interesting Watch it Make your own mind up Dont be a sheep Following the heard,Notr
I enjoyed this film been waiting to watch it for a while now before the release dates were delayed several times  was something different for me new character new powers new anti hero felt like I was watching Dracula Untold the CGI and the story line was awesome Ill rate this  looking forward in watching it again when it releases on Blu Ray I like the fact that was a thriller horror Sci  think it was way better than The Eternals The eco location super power I enjoyed as well,Notr
What is happening to the movie industry Arent we all sick of plots like this There are other categories to explore than superhero and CGI crapThis was just laughable Sorry Who thought casting jared leto in something like this would make any senseDont waste ur time,Notr
Probably Jared Littles best performance ever I morbed a little when Dr Michael Morbius said his iconic line its morbin time Its no wonder that this film sold three morbillion tickets in the first week,Notr
Not the absolute garbage people are saying it is but also not a good film Maybe if you ignore the post credits you can actually enjoy how they decided to present the characterThe fighting scenes are pretty great tho,Notr
The movie Morbius is a simple actions adventure and sort of crime film which is about a doctor suffering from a rare blood disease Doctor Morbius is after a cure but in the process he turns himself to a something unexpected and changes his life for goodThe movie is so underrated that I thought I was going to watch a complete garbage However it turned out to be as satisfactory as any other action movies Almost every actors performance was okay I liked it actually However the screenplay could have been deeper The process for the characters to evolve is not enough and it actually needed more time and deeper meaning to it The visual and special effects were satisfactorily interesting however they could explore the abilities of the main character further and deeperGenerally the movie is satisfactorily entertaining if you lower your expectations level and enjoy the movie,Notr
I dont even like to review the movie its that bad I dont even understand what Ive watched because they make everything wrong in this movie The CGI the storyline everything is so bad that I was so disappointed that they make this amazing character useless in DCU,Notr
Ive seen great Marvel films and I also seen the worst Marvel films ever made and I would say that Morbius is somewhat a Borderline Marvel To meit would be in the league as the Tim Story Fantastic Four filmsAng Lees HulkElectraX The Last Stand and Daredevil I mean if you got time to kill and would to fill in the voidwell by all means check it out sometime but dont except a Black Panther or Avengers Infinity War type Blockbuster for this film isnt it Just enjoy it for what it is I will say this thoughJared Leto makes a better Morbius than a Joker Maybe Morbius will be better in the sequel that is if Sony and Marvel decide to do another one in the future,Notr
The reviews made it seem like it was some Birdemic level of movie But it was a pretty formulaic vampire movie with some fun moments Matt Smiths little dance was hilarious he understood the assignment Jared Leto was as good as you could be with this script Watch it if you ever catch it on cable nothing offensive about it In fact it is better than a lot of recent MCU if Im being honest,Notr
"Somehow earning a whopping  morbillion dollars at the box office morbius stands as one of the greaters achievements of film that man has ever made No morbs nor words can describe the mastermorb that this morb has morbed and i implore you all to watch it effective immediately That being said morbius is still one of the movies of all time and the medium does not allow itself to express its greatness and after having watched morb man doing morb stuff  times the movie does get a little stale i know the true morbers between you will scream blasphemy but it is the truth morbius will no longer rule over my life but shall now be a distant memory as i take on pastures new Though i shall never forget the joy and happiness that morbius  has brought me that is allI only have one more thing to say to you
its morbin time",Notr
So my friend was like Lets go watch this new movie about some vampire Jared dude And I was like Aw hell yeah a vampire thats sick When we went to the theater I was hopeful to watch a good movie But what I didnt know was that I was gonna watch something even better No medicine can make you fall asleep faster than this movie TRUST ME If you wanna watch this movie Watch it before sleeping Trust me youll have a wonderful reset,Notr
I finally got around to watching this and I enjoyed it for an action movie with good acting Things progress quickly in Moribus almost too quickly The story is essentially about two friends and the birth of ahero The hero part isnt really clear though Dr Moribus is dedicated to saving lives and saving himself and his best friend from an incurable illness Moribus is a genius and he creates a cure that in typical mad science experiment goes horribly wrong Then the good doctors best friend takes the cure with predictably bad results Unfortunately the whole thing is very predictable and because of that a little boring There are some great FX and action sequences but compared to todays FXheavy movies it is pretty standard fare Decent for a movie night,Notr
I read most of the  star reviews and after doing so I realized that ALL of them are sarcastic If it wernt for all the sarcastic  star reviews this movie would be a way worse rating than  This was actually AMUSING to watch If your thinking of watching this please dont waste your time ,Notr
I went to be morbed and I wasnt disappointed My wife was morbed as well so one could say we were comorbed Garet Leftoe was the right choice to fill this role I would know Ive been to one of his summer camps,Notr
This movie was generally good but the final fight scene was a little bit disappointing but I personally think It had a good build up and found this way more enjoyable then eternals definitely worth a watch imo ,Notr
The movie did not disappoint I love comic characters I did not know much about morbius so I liked learning his origin story The plot made sense and there was lots of action I like the cgi effects The way the character transformed and flew was very bat like I also liked the way the bats responded to morbius The actors were believable I dont know why the movie has been given low ratings Wonder Woman  and the Eternals were much worse This is a great movie if you like fantasy If you wait until the credits run there are two previewswhich makes me wish for a sequel I think you should give it a chance,Notr
Ive been so excited for this movie Morbius is one of my favorite characters from the Spiderman s cartoon And I love everything vampires so this should have been a homerun for me But the story is so predictable it became a snooze fest The relationship between Morbius and the scientist was very shallow and uninteresting Matt Smith was the saving grace in all scenes he was in and the relationship portrayed between Morbius and him was lovely And thats it Thats one of the few things that was entertaining to watchI really wanted to like this But weve seen so many origin stories at this point the script and dialogue has to be Somewhat good This was dreary and poorly written ,Notr
If you like mystery science theatre  then this is your chance to create your very own episode as this film is so predictable and so cliched its a riotous laugh a minute if youre in the right mood to provide a narrativeTheres not much more I can say about the movie and it is impossible to write a spoiler for a film that is so predictable  youve already figured it out so you wont need me to tell youLike I said its so bad its almost good we need people to make bad B movies for the next generation to laugh about and this is one for the vaultsSo grab a box of popcorn and a few beers and sit in with your wittiest mates and have a laugh at the expense of this rotten tomato of a film,Notr
I took my time before putting the trigger to watch it in person I dont understand what is all the fuss about the movie being bad It is not bad no really not bad at all Maybe yes it did not live up to someone other superhero genre spectacles but the movie was generally good and well throughout Yes certain things shouldve been better and prolonged but it is not bad nor it should be ignored I recommend a watch but yes do not expect the wow factor of other superhero genre movies If you go with a low expectation maybe you will enjoy it more than you thought,Notr
Choppy and lack of character development Protagonist vs Antagonist storyline that does not make sense Jared Leto is a great actor but even he cant carry this movie This played like it was written by a  year old child,Notr
Id rather jump off the golden gate bridge onto a floor of lego than watch that sorry excuse of movie again If you plan to watch this movie bring a nice cold bottle of bleach to help you get through it,Notr
Morbius lacked so much depth and practically fought for its life just to have some The dynamics between Jared Letos Morbius and Matt Smiths Milo was just boring and unnecessary To be honest though most of the movie was unnecessary It was a cool idea but it was boring and aside from a few cool scenes its completely forgettable Theres so much to keep up with and so much that doesnt make sense so its just killing itself from scene to scene The after credits were rough and let in some pretty big potholes The fight scenes are messy and while creative definitely not outstanding And the character deaths that were included to make the story more interesting were stupid and angering This entire movie was just a mess If there ever is a second one theres gonna be quite a bit to clean up,Notr
I fairly enjoyed Morbius for what it is the effects are really good Jared Leto is great and even has pretty good music The negativity is understandable too theres some poor bits for sure like the dialogue in a couple parts was meh and the way it was filmed felt off occasionally otherwise for a stand alone marvel movie its great action wise I love how its part thriller that aspect was perfect Daniel Espinosa made a solid experience that is at least ,Notr
Morbius is the funniest movie Ive ever seen The story is so brainless I dont even know where to begin Imagine a tenyearold writing a story about a guy with bat powers Thats what the writing feels likeAlso Morbius acts so awkward I dont know if the character is supposed to be awkward or if the actor is just awkward Its so weirdTheres one thing that really pissed me off Its the pointless chemistryfree romance so many movies love to include for some reason Just leave the hero single dude All those partners have zero relevance so just stop pleaseAnyways its morbin time,Notr
Morbius is not a perfect movie but its a fun and entertaining ride Its a comic book movie and yes it wont win an Oscar or other awards But its still not that bad how some people make it seem it isDefinitely worth watching and seeing it for yourself before being scared off by reviews that are not even slightly accurateJust my opinion ,Notr
First off Jared Leto isnt my first choice as an actor at all and before the movie I was honestly skeptical of him being the lead actor but this is probably hands down one of his best acting movies Ive seen him play Hes typically a supporting role in bigger movies but he killed it as the main character I dont understand the hate around this movie Yes it couldve been at least  minutes longer with more action scenes but for a SonyMarvel movie they did a great job and was up to pare with their other movie Venom I believe this movie deserves a lot better ratings then what its receiving and I definitely believe its worth the watch,Notr
I really thought I couldnt get more disappointed in life alas Morbius takes that crown A disservice to Jared Letos acting capabilities a completely disastrous plot that leads you to a land you wouldnt want to venture into Please dont get me started on the CGI The VFX I applaud solid Also what happened with that cringy filming There was an unnecessary zoom I got second hand embarrassment I do hope that the second movie redeems this story,Notr
This piece of garbage movie would make Chris Evans Fantastic  look good The movie made no sense this movie brought nothing to the MCU It had to much CGI Id rather watch Green Lantern on repeat the even attempt to see that movie again Sony needs to sell the rights to Disney because they are just destroying their characters and its only going to get worse I would not count this as a Marvel movie this movie is quite literally a joke If your looking to hook up in a movie theater but are on the edge about doing it because there might be people this movie is for you because there isnt going to be a single person in there,Notr
It is not something never seen before but it is on the same level as  Marvel moviesThere were some unpredictable moments in the movie and characters had decent depth but nothing really spectacularThe effects and the action scenes were entertaining especially the Echolocator effectsAll in all it is an average movie that in my opinion deserves a rating higher than  at leastI guess people still hate Jared Leto for his Joker adaption,Notr
Its that bad Script is bad acting is bad its a shame this is a Marvel storyline Dont waste your time on this movie and find something better to do,Notr
I think Mobius is cool The chemistry between Mobius and Martine is kind of awkward I just dont buy it In fact I really like Milo because hes sure and evil But the characters motivations are all over the place I am just not sold with any of their convictions At the end it felt like a cliff hanger where none of the characters are fully developed especially the detectives Martine and Nicholas even Mobius himself Milo has the best arc Overall character backstory are like  covered and doesnt explain much Thats not a movie by any standard More like a tv show,Notr
Critics suck Excellent movie Cant wait to see him team up Keep me and my family entertained and non stop actionGreat villain Great hero Great supports I have no idea why critics are being so harsh on this,Notr
Morbius the movie  is bad I guess the sound visual effects  CGI isnt entirely bad and neither is Jared Leto But other than that this movie is a sad and unfortunate embarrassment especially to any key decision maker involved in its releaseThere was probably a sensible Morbius movie at some point but this movie is not it This movie is a choppy mess Its senseless incoherent and disjointed stitched together with questionable editing thatll leave viewers befuddled and utterly dissatisfiedI cannot believe Sony released this,Notr
A good time if you just want a bad film to laugh and poke holes at Wouldnt be that way if it didnt take itself so seriously while being so simultaneously stupid,Notr
I was excited for this title and went on opening night I love the twosided Morbius struggling with good vs evil A mysterious Marvel character Lehto is the perfect fit Give it a chance you will enjoy the story and action It will leave something to be desireddont have lofty expectationsI would love to have seen deeper into the main character the action simplified and movie made more graphic With those tweaks and a resulting R rating you would have a  cult classic,Notr
It was advertised as some kind of thriller but it rarely tried and even when it did it was rather patheticMany scenes that wanted to be serioussadepic Were kind of funnycringe The motions of the movie were all over the placeAction was terrible in the beginning they tried to be a bit spooky with it but then just went full on Taken and cut every  secondsIt makes no sense the whole thing of Morbius is that hes fast and has boosted awareness Why would they get close to him in action and not show anythingInstead we get to see him fly around the cityThe antagonist was a mess he had no motivation no background of being this evil guy he was portrayed asHe just woke up one day and chose violenceThere were many insignificant side characters that added nothing to the story,Notr
The movie itself is decent Fantastic special effects a great character and Jared Leto is far better at Morbius than he was allowed to be as Joker The story however is a long buildup with a short conclusion and even then I am not convinced the movie ended with me satisfied While I know that we will see Morbius again soon in other projects as a character building origin story I dont think this one quite hit the mark and wont be remembered well Definitely worth watching but I am glad I didnt pay to see it,Notr
Disney shills and unprofessional shill reviewers have bombed this almost average movie Visual effects and visuals were great sound was great much better than Wonder Woman  Eternals VenomCarnage Black Widow or ShangChai Dont believe the hate VERY cool entertaining and atmospheric The leads were all very strong probably my fave Jarad Leto performance and Adria Arjona was fantastic I just wish Hollywood would stop trying to make Matt Smith work bit cringe though he was great on the Crown Over all it could have used a bit better story with villains but I will happily pay to see another  Morbius and Nightstalkers movies,Notr
"The CGI was good Jared leto was decent
But the story doesnt make sense the start was good but as it paces you realize that this story is forgettable too many plot holes and bad jokes",Notr
Dont know why Every time his pupil changed when doing the sensing stuff reminds me of PUPA from Solar Opposites And Rick and Morty as wellAnd the whole story felt quite hurried,Notr
I expected a lot worse but it was quite okay I loved the CGI transitions from the human to bat and viceversa genius The best effect that had Marvel ever I have mixed feelings about the smoke but pretty original appreciate the effort If it were original not many slow motions superficial about the  deaths and the boss fight it would have dazzled me but its okay like this too way too much hate for this  rate movie you should see Tom Hollands SpiderMan movies and Black Widow Anyway des gustibus Love not hate Peace,Notr
I am no virgin anymore  this is the first time ever that I fell asleep in a big screen cinema What I watched and can remember is nothing good generic storytelling the usual boring cgi feast blabla and lala and some bumbum A typical product of zeitgeist of what once was a dream factory and became clone city,Notr
Words cant describe how amazing and entertaining this film is While watching I couldnt take my eyes off it because I had a stroke from excitement Every time I watch this film in the future I will feel that warmth awesomeness excitement and indescribable happiness as if I were a child again and my stepfather again calls me to play in his lustful but no less cozy basement,Notr
Morbius is literally a vampire at the end of the day You cant have a vampire without blood Plasma Youve gotta be kidding me For the spiderman animated series its for children so fine call it plasma but come on The audience below the rated R audience doesnt even know who morbius is mostly obviously not allThe audience is people over  and they made it pg Thats its worst fault I liked the characters and story Im not mad im just disappointed,Notr
Im giving this  I know this movie doesnt deserve  but what some of guys are review bombing here If they like a movie its  and if dont  Why Just enjoy this movie and I truly believe there is so much room to be better in writing And Jared Leto is terrific in Morbius character Hope to see him in future with Spider man with better writing,Notr
Im a pretty big fan of Morbius after Ive seen him in the s animated SpiderMan series and read some of his  comicbook run Morbius The Living Vampire When this was announced I got super excited and throughout lockdown  it was one of my most anticipated upcoming comicbook movies It was a crazy letdown with a messy script bad writing uninteresting characters VFX that varies between really good and just awful a terrible final battle and a really abrupt ending Jared Leto carries this movie HARD,Notr
I have decided that just because the media and public say that a movie is terrible that you should still see it for yourself Both this movie and Madame Webb were so harshly dragged by the public that I decided not to see them Until recently when I had my sisterinlaw in town and we were binge watching movies that were on our list to see but had been rated badly so we were holding off While watching this movie we kept looking at each other wondering why people hated this movie so much Just like Madame Webb it was a superhero movie that held our attention had us rooting for the superhero and hating the villain Maybe were just not that picky and can be easily entertained But I would say to anyone who likes superhero movies I recommend they watch it Then go watch Madame Webb because I also recommend that one,Notr
Morbius starts off very average before falling off a cliff with a rushed CGI mess of a finale The movies one saving grace is Matt Smiths hammy performance as he glees it up as the villainous Milo The rest of the movie is one gigantic bore with Leto sleepwalking his way through the role The last  minutes come and go with little fanfare as it looks like it has just been cobbled together at the last minute There are  mid credit sequences but by the time they come you wont care enough to have any interest in it whatsoever Hopefully Jared Leto never meets Hardy or Holland Woeful attempt at Morbius,Notr
Some of these reviews are embarrassingWhen I read a review I dont want a step by step account of what happened in the filmSome people just want actorsactresses to fail and some reviews here are patheticThis film was enjoyable l having no prior knowledge of the character may have been better as some seem to be annoyed with how Morbius was portrayed but it seemed fine to me and Leto was decent throughoutYes its a generic story but one that looks like it needs to be told this way and will only get better as more comes throughI think people are so annoyed at the MarvelSony saga they cant just appreciate a decent film when they see one in a standalone fashionWatch it and make your own mind up dont just see the overal rating as there are many reviews that are ridiculous,Notr
Absolute garbage If you cant sleep and pills dont help just turn on this movie and you will fall asleep within minutes ABSOLUTE GARBAGE Even venom is better,Notr
Movie must have come out early at the local cinemas so went and watched it with a couple of mates It lacked any real substance and the ending felt incomplete It felt like it was made purely to advertise the next movie in the series,Notr
I thought Sony outdid themselves with how bad Venom was Then they released Let There Be Carnage and I thought nothing could be worse than that Enter Morbius Absolutely awful The action scenes will put you to sleep I strongly recommend NOT wasting your time on this,Notr
As someone that has been watching superhero movies since batman in  as a kid I would say this film is just middle of the road nowhere near as bad as some are making out but I think we are just spoilt for better choice right now even if that choice is another  or  star marvel movie until a really good once comes out and repeats the cycleBut I noticed many reviews keep mentioning that morbius in the movie jokes about saying i am venom only joking but that is just in the trailer for a joke its not in the actual movie so it shows alot of these reviews arent real doesnt mean people that did see it didnt hate it but it does say alot for online mentality of people that dont even bother to watch the film sometimes it was fine but its not something ill likely ever rewatch again despite liking most of letos work usually,Notr
Marvel and Star wars fandoms both hate their own franchises more than anyone else I was told this movie was so bad that it was unwatchable and the worst movie ever It really is just an average super hero origin story Some parts are good others are sloppy or just plain bad But it by no means is it a terrible movie If you like Marvel movies and you arent a self hating nitpicker you will like this movie Couldve been better but still good The special effects werent bad The acting was high quality I kind of wish it was a mini series or a show instead of a movie because I feel like they couldve done so much more Watch it its entertaining and thats why we watch movies,Notr
I was afraid to dislike it since many people put a bad review but I was really surprised that I actually loved it The story is well developed and so are the characters I didnt get bored at all and the visual effects are insane Even though its not quite what a Marcel fan would expect its still a wonderful movie I would recommend it gladly to people who like me fear to dislike it because of the reviews,Notr
Highly enjoyable glad I didnt listen to the critics This may be the Marvel character movie nobody asked for but maybe its the movie we didnt know we needed,Notr
This movie was a massive dissapointment for the ages This movie looked like a movie that chopped up to get it as short as possible This cut is terrible and the CGI needs to be redone Sony has no soul and needs to do these characters right,Notr
I fastforwarded through this The problem is twofold One no one cares about the characters They are flat and insipid and any modicum of development is a caricature at best particularly the opening scenes Worse its performed by otherwise very capable actorsSecond Hollywood must stop feeding the myth of the MCU as its generating worse and worse quality all in the name of the almighty dollar There is no resemblance here to a superhero and even if there were story is abandoned in favour of makeup and special effects and a repulsive visage The fetishization of all things MCU is second only to well the second amendment and with  year olds shooting teachers we know how useful fetishes can beStop the MCU,Notr
The Morbius movie was a bit better Because I have not made any expectations here You see the movie is not so bad movie Action was good in some places And there was no logic in some of these places ,Notr

What in the world was this movie Its a character nobody asked for a movie nobody was hyped about it had a terrible marketing plan and its trying to hard to be Venom which also wasnt good Disaster,Notr
Vamp movie with no blood I know only very little about the Marvel stories I havent heard about this character until I saw the trailer a few months agoI always liked Adrias and Jareds acting so I was excited about this movieI went to pump up my blood pressure with some good actions Well my BP stayed at  It would have been even lower if I hadnt drank  liters of cola in my boredom And believe me Im very easy to pleaseIm sure lots of work went into it and its definitely not  However as much as I really wanted to enjoy it after  minutes I could have told that would happen in the next  minutes even with close to  knowledge of Marvel charactersThe shirtless scene was nice  lol  I gave an extra star for that The actors did their bests I guess the CGI and the makeups were fine for me and there were a few great sound effects and cam angle shots as well but the music lacked of creativity and I really missed the action the BLOOD and exciting wow scenes which would have made me want to watch it again It wont happen unfortunately,Notr
All the reviews I read before this movie had me worried After seeing this in the RPXIMAX theatre I cannot believe how bad this movie was rated If you are a fan of marvel especially comics this movie is well worth the timemoney investment The post credit scenes make you leave the theatre wanting more Awesome experience,Notr
Maybe that was a bit of an overreaction but the movie was just so mind numbingly dull and uninteresting I definitely wouldnt recommend this to anyone,Notr
The pacing is tight and the action was awesome the colors effects while in a fight was looking amazing the story was decent as a origin The st half was good although the final act the last mins were little meh the villians suddenly gone rogue was little odd felt like it just happened and the Nurses stuff felt lost at the end with it the post credits just didnt make no sense considering the man morbious was Overall st half was good and the ending felt little mess although its a part entertaining and a decent watch,Notr
Dont see it  nothing else needs to be saidDO NO SEE THIS FILM EVER It will make your life worse It will hurt your soul Make you want to never see films againThe worst superhero movie of all time,Notr
The movie was horrible Dont get me wrong the cgi is good action is acceptable and the slow motion bits are cool But the dialogue is cringy and awkward most of the time We didnt get to learn anything about the true potential of the bat let alone the identity of morbius I thinks i speak for a lot of people when i say we expected better,Notr
For all the people out there who love MarvelDC super hero stories made into movies this film is for you You deserve it and youll love it as there are tons of plot holes filled with bad acting and dialogue You never have to ask why something happens as you dont careFor most of us we are interested in a unique and smart story telling experience for an origin series This doesnt happen often but when it does its nice to seeCant say much else Jared isnt entirely to blame as the script has him starting off on an offshore freighter for some reason and just gets more bizarre from there  star fanboys industry employees and bot farms will continue to prop up the dismal ratings and reviews,Notr
Im gonna be completely honest and say it wasnt nearly as bad as the critics say However it wasnt exactly a masterpiece either The plus for me was Leto He delivered an amazing performance,Notr
"Just saw Morbius in Gteborg Quick Review
I was thoroughly entertained Is it good Yes
Is it very good Well It is a classic origin story Leto did well Matt Smith was better in other roles but Really liked Adria Aarjona The fighting scenes reminded my of the PS game
Infamous Second Son",Notr
Jared Leto did great becoming Morbius With that being said the movie is boring Would like to see more of Jared as Morbius but with a different director Still the movie is perfectly watchable,Notr
Actually this would be great if I were  years old and watching it on a Saturday morning in between Ark II and the Power Rangers whilst eating Captain Crunch,Notr
Having went to the cinema with some excitement at the prospect of this movie offering we left and like many felt very underwhelmed  disappointed I would not recommend it as a film to rush and go see or to spend money to go seeUnderstandably it is an origin story to introduce Dr Morbius to us in cinematic terms but it falls to short in what felt like a very basic story and scriptThe CGI was complete overkill so much so that in action scenes you are basically looking at nothing but a blur on the screen I also found the overall appearance of Dr Morbius in his vampire form to be so very unrealistic that it detracted from the film itself as I sat through scenes thinking to myself about how bad the CGI was yes he becomes a monster but this looked like CGI from yrs ago,Notr
If this movie was released a decade ago i would give a  star But after watching dozens of movies like Morbious it will be considered as an average movie Though it was entertaining but failed to produce a plot which is out of the boxDr Micheal Morbious was born with a rare blood disease which is leading him to death His mate Milo is also in the same situation as morbious is So Morbious sacrificed his life to invent the cure of the disease and found a hope with bat gene But experiment goes wrong and disaster begin to happen This is the storyline in simple words Jerad Leto is a genius actor and portrayed Joker in DC Universe But Morbiuos did not let him utilized his best as there were nothing in the sript for him But an intriguing situation will come at the end of the movie as Morbious is started to connect with the rest of the Marvel Universe Hope next movie will portray character Morbious more strongly and will use the best of Leto,Notr
What is the point of these movies of Spidermans greatest villians without any Spiderman What is the history of Morbius without SpidermanTheir first meeting was a classic in comic book history in Amazing SpiderMan  and  Now that classic history is deleted thanks to the people who own the rights to one character but not the otherSame thing with Venom and Carnage If Spiderman is not involved then it is not going to be what it should be and what it could be Sad,Notr
The storyline seemed like a below par story written by an inexperienced writer It lacked depth and the film seemed too rushed The character development couldnt progress because the film skipped major scenes The film was easy to watch and the cinematic effects were well developed There seems to be several hit and miss with Marvels recent films especially when introducing new characters,Notr
I regret seeing this in theaters because I could have watched Literally Anything Else The least it could do is be so bad that its funny but it doesnt even do that Its just boring Every time something happened I was waiting for the plot to pick up but it never did the movie just ended It seems like they just put way too much time effort and funding into everything except the actual plot It could have been decent if the writing wasnt so dry and something actually happened in the movie I really hope Sony doesnt waste their time making a sequel but I guess it would be interesting to see if they could somehow produce something worse,Notr
Suffers from the same flaws as movies like venom but at least its not super goofy So I appreciated that no stupid jokes every  minutes Villain is weak Fight scenes are weird But its fine,Notr
This movie was excessively bad The screenplay is extremely choppy and rushed Im not even halfway through the movie and I dont know if I will make it through Only reason to watch this is to see an overpowered Jared Leto jump across large distances Feels like a  hour movie that was cut down to whatever the run time is If youre thinking about watching this you will get more pleasure from watching the Everything wrong with youtube video than the actual movie Not sure if I needed to read a comic or something before this but there are so many plotholes that will never be filled Honestly do not watch this you will gain nothing,Notr
Michael MorbiusJared Leto a doctor who is slowly dying from a rare blood disease struggles to find a cure when he thinks he has but things work a little too well until he discovers theres more supernatural to it then he could have imaginedIt was entertaining but to much feels taken out like it was supposed to be R rated but they decided at the last minute decided to take out most of the violence in order to get a PG  Everybody plays there roles pretty well Jared Leto does alright has Morbius but the film itself is pretty cliched but still fun and entertaining and if that is all you want then Morbius does deliver,Notr
Refused to watch it in the first place after all these negative reviews But let me tell u one thingafter all the reviews it was unexpectedly watchableI would sayYesnot a kind of superhero or supervillain movie we all wanted but,Notr
A fairly strong start but goes downhill as the plot unfolds with a rushed pace  uninspired writing The color scheme is great  most of the CGI is solid A strong premise with horror aspects but isnt made with love or care,Notr
This has got to be the worse casting ever No empathy for any of the characters and a substandard plot Pretty cool effects but fails everywhere else,Notr
Morbius is one of those rare films that has such a bad reputation that upon actually watching I was surprised by how completely palatable if not bland it turned out to be I kept waiting for that scene which would explain all the hate or the endless memes but it never cameUnfortunately there was never any point where the film grabbed my attention either despite some topshelf visual effects The villains origin and motivation made sense but were somehow shallow compared to the protagonist and the ultimate conflict between them was more of a plot contrivance than anything characterdrivenMorbius is not a film I regret watching but its certainly not one that I will return to view again,Notr
Too bad as I really wanted to like the movie But since the beginning there are so many problems Plot writing etc Only good thing its the sound quality Not even the special effects were decent,Notr
It seems like Jared Letto has an uphill battle for positive reviews no matter what he does The guys a superstar Yeah I know he thought he should have played thr joker and that annoyed people but to be honest Morbius was a decent film I rate it better than the nd Venom for sure The CGI was great and not as over the top as other reviews may say I do wonder if this was originally slated for a D release as it would make sense for all the effects surrounding the action scenes Im pretty picky and judgy and was put off reading the negative reviews but I was pleasantly surpriseded after seeing the film,Notr
This movie is a bland  predictable as it gets Believe in the reviews  avoid at all cost smh I wasnt too hyped going in to see it even more so leaving Time I can not get back,Notr
First off if Marvel wants a vampire movie that badly then focus on Blade If Morbius had stuck to being a vampire movie I might have given it a higher rating Dont get me wrong I love a good vampire movie but sadly the more I watched all I saw was cheap knockoffs of Dracula Untold and the ultimate vampire movie The Lost Boys Some scenes were damn near identical The ONLY thing I liked was Morbiuss black trench coat with the purple silk lining That being said the end credit scenes were pretty cool and if you watch it on a streaming network I recommend skipping the entire movie and just watch those instead,Notr
I saw hate regarding this movie from the startFrankly I dont get itThis movie has Morbius in it and a correct version of himRead the comics If so then you should see its a good fit hereI loved the story here and the sequences with Morbius in his vampire form was amazingThis movie was for me amazing Always been a Morbius fan and I went in and saw this movie without any hopes It deliveredI hope we will get plenty more of Morbius in the near futureBe safe,Notr
These days for a movie to be good it needs to be at least  hours This movie felt liked a rushed last minute community college film class assignment If I had  million dollars I could have made something much better,Notr
I was really hoping it was going to be as good as I imagined and then i saw it  matt smith as a baddie EPIC FAIL the way he played the character just didnt work for me  cant fault his Dr Who  the CGI or whatever it was  is horrendous as you can tell when it switches between real and CGI for some reason it just looked bad  i just watched it hoping it would get better and the ending during the credits i just wouldnt put the two together not in any reality i remind you this is my personal view of what I watched dont let this put you off  you might like it,Notr
Yes its short yes its a little bit overdone but I liked it a lot The acting was pretty good especially Jared Hoping for a better sequel maybe rated R,Notr
Im not sure why this got slated as much as it did I really enjoyed it Yes there are better Marvel films out there but there are much worse ones too I enjoyed this far more than The Eternals for example which bored me to tears I also preferred this to Venom but know a lot of people loved thatIm not usually a great fan of the Universal films side of Marvel as they dont seem to be great but for me this was done well and I hope that more films will come from it This has been hinted at with the end credit scenes and I liked what they hinted at so fingers he returns in the Blade movies when they come out,Notr
It seems there is a bit of a bandwagon against this film It is not a great film but it is watchableIt starts off well but then drifts along doesnt really go anywhere and then the ending is a bit weakIf you like marvel films I would watch it but with lower expectations,Notr
I wonder why all the hate and awful reviews of this movie This was actually really good Most of the bad reviews I read sounded like haters of either Jared Leto or of the genre If Marvel wants to try some horror to pull in new viewers it works I just watched it and I dont watch ANY superhero flicks Just not my thing I dont hate on them I just dont get the pull Plus its really difficult to put together a good vampire werewolf or monster flick without worn out tropes and it coming off as cheesy and cliche Anyhow I liked it and I hope Marvel does more Its also another movie that proves you should never trust online opinions and just watch it for yourself,Notr
Remember Venom  Remember how it had characters with almost no distinct traits or charismatic screen presence Remember how it had toothless spineless boring visually incomprehensible action sequences Remember how its villain was laughably underwritten and inexplicably turned to pure evil with zero hesitationBut also remember how that movie also had some fun moments where Tom Hardy carried it with hilarious banter and visual gags with VenomNow imagine a movie that only has those bad things listed above while all of the fun humor and any sense of selfawareness has been stripped awayThats this movie and it is so boring There are no stakes emotion themes or drama and there is no sense of funIm going to take a nap now I need one and Ive earned it,Notr
Jared Leto did a great job as the Vampire Super Hero Michael Morbius Sure the movie was predictable but arent most super hero films Not sure why people havent rated it well because it was a fun film,Notr
Morbius is a boring dull film that is so bad you have to turn off your brain to enjoy the film or watch it five timesMorbius has a colour intro that doesnt fit the aesthetic of the film that already makes it bad and the two post credit scenes make no sense but across the spiderverse it does fix the issue but its still bad I will not watch it againI wouldnt waste your time but there are a lot of mixed reviews on here so it is personal preference by the looks of it I dont know why they chose morbius they could have picked a spider man villain that is more recognisable Instead we got this,Notr
Theres a lot of trash reviews about this movie and I understand its individual opinions but I feel like theres a ban wagon of reviewers out there that are bound for negativity That being said this was a solid movie To me its as solid as the first Venom movie was Its not going to break many records if any but it was enjoyable to see a relatively unknown Marvel character come to the big screen The visuals were more B Jared Leto did great I didnt care for Tyreses character and the villain was a throw away but the battles were fun and the story was decent I liked the Easter eggs and cameos and Id be happy to see Morbius again in future movies I gave it a  and am happy I saw it,Notr
Great concept good story but the editing was so bad it ruined the flowClearly had big chunks cut out of it lots of little sequences clearly out of order making it feel like a bunch of scenes thrown together,Notr
Its okay Jared Leto and Matt Smith do a great job the storyline is okay and the CGI isnt the worst weve seen from marvel I think the primary issue is that its came out when Marvel has had their best with Endgame and SpiderMan The movie does not shine like some others The build up to the finale was great the execution could have used another pass through the editorTldr its fine but the ending isnt polished,Notr
Finally I get to watch this masterpiece or to put it simply the renaissance of cinematographic art or in English the best film of all time I simply also have no words to describe the validity and awesomeness of this film just as this film has no end Not literally this film has no end no end to its awesomenes and genius The screenwriters left us with no end in principle so that we would be speechless which happened to me too forever trapped in the abyss of the time continuum in the endless temptation of this film until we become one with it until we become MORBIUS  This movie is a typical example of CINEMA which doesnt need a sequel to satisfy our hunger for more viewing of new scenes And I liked the song that says have sx the most Its just another added bonus in the level of positivity and genius of this movie because right now Im going to have sx,Notr
I dont know what all these low reviews Ive watched all Marvels movies and i felt that is one of them I really shocked with it  over all rate  I said to my self yeah  if it is marvel product would take at least  out of ten However i dont like these very handsome men in an action type and may be my first time to watch Gared Leto but i enjoyed the movie so much,Notr
I really wanted to love this movie The CGI unfortunately was so bad it ruined the movie for me Its so bad it distracts from the storyline and takes away from the actors,Notr
The CGI was excellent The performances were good Can I blame the lackluster on the writing All of the pieces are here for better than average entertainment I keep going over the scenes in my mind and maybe it suffers from insufficient character development There are some things missing Poor editing I have all of the pieces to the puzzle but cannot put it together Has the MCU made me jaded There are many similarities to Batman Since this an origin story I guess the mystery will go on,Notr
I dont know the comic nor what to expect from this new Marvel story But I was definitely intrigue by the synopsis And after I watching it Im pretty satisfied Its not like other superhero movies Its much darker than others Now I dont know what problem those  stars raters have but as someone who doesnt have any expectations of this movie I find it quite amazing Dont believe the ratings watch it for yourself You might like it Or even better love it,Notr
With all the hype and bad press leading into me finally watching this I can safely saw that yes it really is a bad film The story and direction are straight out of the early s superhero film era and no not the good ones Leto isnt the worst in the role hes just a bit underdeveloped and mopey for me The first half isnt terrible but the second half just drags on and on while limping to its lackluster climax Theres a lot of unintentional comedy tooAdd in the blatant copying of scenes and music from Batman Begins and this film really irritated me Sony has no idea what its doing with these SpiderMan spinoffs and how to tie them into the MCU as evidenced by the bafflingly constructed postcredit scenes,Notr
This flick was engaging from the start I loved the CGI and the fastpace The premise is predictable but the film is just so much fun and quite the indulgent escape Dont listen to these harsh reviews Its Marvel for crying out loud Kick back and enjoy,Notr
I read many reviews when movie released Even then I gave a try but I think it was a mistake Movie was written directed and executed badly The characters in the movie were also unrelatable You cant connect either with hero or villian The editing work was also bad Camera work was also weird and confusing In short this movie didnt have any soul It looked like Sony made this movie just for the sake of keeping the rights with them Overall it was a bad attempt to make a movie,Notr
I traveled over a hundred miles to meet with my friends in the big city so we could all experience Morbius together Morbius is easily the peak of comic book movies I would not change a thing,Notr
Im not really sure on the below really low ratings but it kept me watching Felt the pace was good and decent enough action also the change in to a vampire was also really goodNot really sure what was missing maybe story could of been better but I liked the horror element of the movie but story could of been done better overall wasnt bad,Notr
I admit I had no idea of Morbius so was going in blind On finishing the movie I have no intention of finding out any more The film is slow and I mean slow The one hour forty four minutes felt like three hoursIt was mainly dark so not a lot could be seen the CGI was ok and most of action happened in the last third of the filmAlso having Milo the actually rather good Matt Smith calling out Michael rather a lot reminded me of The Lost BoysI was lucky that I hadnt paid full price for the cinema ticket as I seriously wouldnt waste my time,Notr
I need to type  characters to tell you how much this sucked but i can sum it up in  word  garbage  Not everything needs to be gread towards  yr olds ,Notr
Good actors the only reason Ill give it  but my oh my what a weak weak script could have been great but instead its just a meaningless hollow story no depth at all Im so disappointed,Notr
I am convinced that this movies rating is being hatebombed by trolls Whether its because people despise Sony or hate Jared Leto I dont know What I do know is that this flick was a fun compelling superhero origin story that kept me entertainedSure it wasnt groundbreaking It wasnt crammed with shareduniverse tieins And it certainly wasnt a masterpiece But the acting was great the CGI was dazzling and the atmosphere was chilling in the best wayJared Leto was a great fit for this role and the character was fleshed out well even if the supporting characters were a bit lacking in this departmentBottom line dont let the bad reviews fool you My husband and I enjoyed this movie and give it a thumbs up,Notr
A scientist trying to find cure for a rare disease and turns into something he did not want friend turns to enemy well I would say it is a great entertainment I liked the movie though slow progress of the plot The ending has few clues for what might be coming next Actions are good and acting is superb,Notr
Im a bit late to the party with all the Morbius fun mostly because I didnt want to spend any money so I had to wait till it came out somewhere for freeIts hilarious but its definitely not supposed to be Its laughably edgy and it takes itself far too seriously The writing is baffling and convenient and the combination of that with the abrupt editing means that things just happen with little reason leaving you a bit confusedOne of the genuinely worst things about the movie is how boring it is to look at The wonky CGI is quite funny but when thats not around everything is just bleak and has that sort of grey filter like an episode of EastEndersHowever its definitely an enjoyably bad movie overall and Id recommend watching it just dont take it as seriously as the film itself does,Notr
This movie was amazing the effects were great I cant believe why anyone would not like this movie It was truly amazing I dont know why you wouldnt like the movie but i loved it I recommend this movie to everyone,Notr
This movie was a disappointment because it could have been great However its not as bad as the reviews suggest The story was interesting for the first half and turned into a hot mess for the second half I could have also done without so much of the CGI because that diminished the film and made it feel cheaper I would have preferred prosthetics instead of the CGI faces because they looked really good for the first half then turned so obviously fake by the second half it was laughable The CGI blurriness when the vampires would move looked terrible I know it was suppose to represent the bat radar but it was distracting I also thought the detectives were pretty pointless to the story and could have been written to make some type of contribution for the climax of the movie It needed to be darker to work with a tone like The Batman However the actors especially Leto did a good job for what they were working with It wasnt terrible just wasnt good,Notr
Hey not all Marvel movies have to be about the big names Spidey Iron Man etc They took a character with a not very recognizable name did the best they could The cliches were there but not too over the top The action scenes and CGI while not jawdropping did keep my interestJared Neto is not my favorite actor but he does a decent job as being driven to succeed without coming off as an egomaniac His character could have used a tighter and more detailed back story Not sure where this timeline fits into the MCU universe although the door is left openWould I pay cash to see this in a theater Nope But an acceptable watch at home,Notr
Morbius is pretty good I liked it Its a very safe origin film for the character and all the Easter eggs from the trailer was there and end credit scenes which I wont spoil Acting was also spoiled Its not a blow you mind film the FX are similar to dracula untold but its a solid safe character arc of the Michael morbius character and how he gets his vampire powers and why,Notr
A standard runofthemill Marvel film with mediocre script and lackluster direction Daniel Espinosa failed to delve into richly detailed character stories and archs even BladeUnderworld did better Playing antihero is no easy task and Leto proved it right,Notr
Spend all the time watching my clock When it ended abruptly i feel free Bad and innecesary CGI  Why he left that smoke effect like he was magical or supernatural Th villain motivation is bad He turns evil in a second The police jokes are so bad and out of time that will Smith should go and slap him,Notr
Why is Sony hiring Bgrade inexperienced director and writers for blockbuster titles This film had tons of room for improvement particularly in its convoluted and lazy screenplay There are scenes where things are happening and we dont know how or why eg Leaning back and almost falling off the rooftop while getting caught amidst the unexplained sonic waves Didnt any one person see these mistakes even in editing to make what Im sure would be easy fixes Im not sure why the midcredit scene was even needed as it made the already incohesive story more incoherent The premise of the story itself was excellent too bad it became a wasted opportunityCinematography was decent although the SVFX couldve been much better and more exciting Sound and score were on point The  min runtime flew by with the decent pacing almost too much so that I feel another  minutes of better experienced writing couldve gone a long way in making this film much better Casting and performances were great all around Still its certainly not as bad as all the critics say it is and I actually enjoyed it more than Pattinson as emo Batman A well deserved  from me,Notr
The great cast good dialogues high budget and decent special effects couldnt save this boring and oredictable movie from disappointing Wasted opportunity,Notr
Imagine if Pablo Picasso had been sent to prison and with no other options began painting on the walls with his own feces This is Jared Leto in MorbiusThe writing is bad the editing is horrific and the plot is nonsensical but Leto delivers This is a masterclass in how to make the most of a terrible film He carries this movie and its so entertaining to imagine what he will say next,Notr
I actually fell asleep I was so bored I didnt care about any of the characters the twist was so predictableIve seen it in too many other films The actors are pretty to look atbut yeah thats about it Wait till its available to rent,Notr
No this is not the worst CBM ever no this is not even the worst Marvel movie ever Fantstic Elektra Ghost Rider  etc Looking at YOU I wouldnt recommend for someone to go out of their way drop everything and go see Morbius but I believe from the performances given by both the leads the action sequences good CGI  predictable but OK story  its worth checking out for a night out,Notr
Really interesting characters and story but it still falls a bit flat affects where way to jumpy and Sony still dont know how to make a great marvel film,Notr
Whoever said too much of a good thing is bad obviously never experienced this film It is a morbsterpiece through and through So many iconic lines and action sequences I couldnt help but cry tears of joy Jared Leto as Morbius not venom is goated What can this man not do When Morbius said where theres a will theres a morb i felt that in my soul Full standing ovation from my fellow morbheads for the rest of the third act This is Scifi at its peakest I expect a full sweep at the Oscars,Notr
"As I write this review Morbius has a  rating on IMDb I definitely think thats way too low If youre a big fan of the MCU then be sure to watch this movie Yeah facts are really good But the plot twist is pretty generic what does a good guy do when he gets powers that make him a bad guy Theres not a lot of originality as the answer that question but the movie isnt bad Just understand that it is almost  origin story so dont expect a big complex plot or narrative I like the two leads especially the bad guy  but who IS the bad guy  
Not sure if the movie did well enough that well see a sequel but this character deserves to be given another story so that we see him become Morbius",Notr
I havnt read any of the comic booksI really dont get the negative reviewsIt was fun and entertainingCertainly not perfect hence  out of Whats with all the hateStoopid humans,Notr
So predictable too typical Would be okay for DC but disgrace for Marvel even associate lvl What to write to make it  character I have really honestly suffocatingly no idea,Notr
Dont believe the DC fan reviews Solid addition to the Sony Spider verse Would love to see him crossover to the MCU My only complaint is I think that should have went for the R rating and made this a true vampire movie blood and all,Notr
Movies like this really make me question the judgment skills of the people behind the scenes I dont think any reasonable person would watch this and this it was perfectly fine for release Maybe next time theyll learn from this and Try a little harder,Notr
Story went to fast could of added some more back story and development to the transformation of the living vampire such as his abilities The villain could of been better Hopefully the end credits lead to something,Notr
Movie suffer the overhyped expectations of Spiderman no way home So for the nerds this movie is bad But for average viewer morbius movie is very good,Notr
Plenty of plot holes goofiness action and a double setupthenextfilm ending Pretty much your standard comic book movie predictable but entertaining Couldve been a lot worse,Notr
This movie is very stale predictable and undeniably boringEven though I have not really seen a movie like this before I feel like ive watched it a billion times before it is so increadibly predictable from the first  minutes of watching ou already know whats gonna happen Past thirty minutes the movie is just so boring The only quarter decent thing about this movie is the fight scenes which still look like they were choreographed by a five year old who just finished watching the matrix,Notr
With all the negative reviews I was expect bad things however I was pleasantly surprised sure you could see the plot a mile away But it was entertaining amazing special effects well acted definitely worth a watch,Notr
Enjoyed it It was not amazing but worth watching The critics are being way to tough on this flick fun action moviebut far from perfectits way better than WW lol,Notr
 when the movie ended i continued to site in theater and checking feelings about movie and i felt nothing the story is shallow no real excitement no passion no personality and no soul nothing Only what i notice is good body of Morbius and that all,Notr
I watched this after all of the hype and the memes died down waiting for a terrible crap fest It honestly wasnt bad In fact it was almost good Im no movie critic and Im probably easier to please than some but I enjoyed it for the most partSome things were rushed and confusing and I did start to check my watch towards the end cause I was starting to get bored so I guess theres my criticism Also I didnt like the ugly vampire facesIve seen some people complaining about the lack of blood and violence and I guess I get that since its a vampire movie and all but thats not really my thing so it didnt bother meAll in all it wasnt great but it was entertaining,Notr
There is nothing outright bad about the film but besides from some ok action that can be hard to follow there is nothing good ether Its just going through the motions and it has nothing interesting or memorable about it It feels like a film made by  people in a factory nothing is done very bad but it lacks heart and vision It doesnt have a style a world worth staying in or characters worth caring for Its not so bad its good its just bland and dull,Notr
The questionable acting and visuals the pacing the nonsensical plot It feels lame cheap and incomplete The interactions of the characters are mostly robotlike and lack deeper emotions The dialogues are really bad The events and the behavior of people are illogical The fight scenes are garbage Making this PG is a bad joke should have been R The references to MCU movies are forced and cringy Also misrepresented The post credit scene is idioticIt has zero rewatch value Its not even a good popcorn movieI cant recommend it other than a collection of bad examples for future filmmakers to avoid,Notr
Morbius is a perfectly acceptable Marvel origin movie Not sure why it is receiving such hate but I can only express my own opinion and dont like to jump on band wagons There have been some stinkers and in my opinion this attempt is not one of them It has its faults in editing cgi and child acting but the story moved along nicely and developed into a entertaining if predictable offering,Notr
Another Marvel regurgitation with a largely predictable plot rushed and impatient choreography and fairly D grade acting Some action scenes are original however the film lacks appeal even for a teenage audience Give it a miss,Notr
Lets be honest people just want to be popular and hating on Jared Leto no matter what the man does gives people those likes and reacts In reality hes quite a talented and diverse actor but the script for the movies is what lets him down Side note Joker should never have been in Suicide Squad he is not part of it Morbius is nice easy to watch short Marvel film Nothing spectacular but also nothing as boring and pretentious as Eternals The movie has an easy to follow story some light bits of comedy a love interest and some fight scenes like any other Marvel movie You dont need to invest too much into this to enjoy it My only criticism is during the flying scenes the effects are a bit jarring to watch Other than that I liked Leto and Matt Smiths performance in this movie A nice and simple  out of  movie,Notr
Where to beginJared Leto and Matt Smith They both did a fantastic job in this movie Giving us a story of what lengths brotherhood can go while discovering what lengths they were willing to go to survive It was terrifying visually beautiful to the eyes and the fight scenes were amazing People just love hating on it because of Jared Leto give it a break people He is actually a good actor I would gladly see this movie again just to please my eyes and mind again And also those two end credit scenes gave my heart a jump for what the future of Jared Letos Morbius is yet to come,Notr
Its a superhero movie I dont know why everyone expects it to be some groundbreaking masterpiece It was enjoyable to watch They kinda forced the villain but no biggie,Notr
The plot of the movie was kinda interesting and I decided to watch that movie even though Im not a fan of Marvel movies The storyline was kinda uninteresting nothing wow but it was wellwritten The characters were kinda interesting and welldeveloped The filming location of the movie was just nice Of course it was a really intense movie and there were too many fight scenes but none of them were epic Gladly that movie had some creepy vibes and Morbius design was kinda scary The CGI were just fine and the effects were okay nothing really innovative Overall it was an average Marvel movie full of battle scenes and I dont think I would watch that movie ever again Last but not least if theyre gonna make a sequel I dont know if Im gonna watch it,Notr
First of all the special effects are good I do not understand the negative reviews of this movie and conversely it probably helped me to enjoy it more I though The Batman was grossly overrated and likewise this movie is better than the reviews its receivedSome parts were semi scary and I thought story was decent Its better than the nd venom that is for sure,Notr
Apparently the critics are having the avenger effect on all the movies They think that the entire superhero movie that will come out can be compared with Avenger and Spiderman no way home that forget the origins and the path that must be followed to reach that levelThe visual effects of the movies were incredible The story is basic the plot and the characters could be further developed but the director preferred to keep everything simple There are some gaps in the story of the movie As it progresses they explain it to you but you feel that some details are missing to give it a little more flavor in the climax moments of the movieJared leto was an incredible performance You cant ask for less from an excellent actor Despite the bad reviews they have of the famous places Morbius is a project that well worked can open schemes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe The Blade vs Morbius showdown would be unique in the CINEMA,Notr
This movie was soooo boring I sit here while writing this nearing the end of the movie considering walking out because this is just so boring The run time was kinda short and the movie felt rushed The big bad of the movie went around killing people so if there were ever a sequel half the characters would be dead They definitely couldve done so much better I mean it is a marvel film after all I find this movie heavily boring and all around me people are walking out,Notr
I thought the movie was great a bit clunky with its story at times but set up the characters and future of the franchise well Recommended for any fan of Marvel movies,Notr
This was enjoyable each to their own I guess The CGI was fairly good some impressive transitions between practical and CGI work Wont win any awards for screenplay but didnt deserve to be panned as it did,Notr
Was really looking forward to this film had a lot of potential but it wasnt anywhere near the expectations Matt Smith was the light of the film Wasnt the worst film but it wasnt the best film Ive ever seen,Notr
Just like my title it is an entertaining movie with just a classic story between friendships woubds good and evil and the struggle to keep sone decency Some nice cgi and decent acting You shouldnt be too demanding though but in my opinion its better than some other Marvel movies like Venom I dont know everything about multiverses but I like superhero movies because of the classic dilemma of how to stay human meanwhile being different and how to keep a stand towards things like temptation Luckely for me the good always wins so that keeps my hope alive about the future of mankind,Notr
I would say that anyone who is a fan of these characters from the comics should stay as far a way from this adaption as possible Almost everything about the film is weak and just incredibly disappointing,Notr
As a fan of the character for many years I feel comfortable saying they did Morbius justice with this movie It might not be what the general audience will love but SpiderMan fans who know and love the rogues gallery with enjoy this movie Its not perfect by any means but its as good as or better than low tier MCU films like Ant Man Black Widow and Eternals Leto was great in this role Looking forward to seeing him reprise the mantle of the living vampire soon,Notr
Leto captured me from the beginning and Smith as the antagonist  was brilliant  Special fx is outstanding the sound bat radar flying colours  exellent  This film a pleasure to watch Hope for a continuation of this storyline Do not be influenced by all the negativity ,Notr
It was a completely forced Marvel movie so there are so many movies in this style I think no It wasnt what I expected it was exactly what I expected,Notr
All the actors understood the assignment specially Jared leto of course The CGI was great smooth amd kinda real Of course the beginning of the movie was so good that made you interested in continuing watching the movie,Notr
I dont know why people and critics are saying this is the worst marvel or any comic book movie I guess these people and critics havent seen Venom  Eternals Batman vs Superman Suicide Squad and so onThis movie had a simple logical story yes it wasnt the best or predictable but it was decent The visual effects and acting was goodWe got what we wanted but nothing moreSo overall this movie delivered what was expected thats it and that wasnt enough for people and critics,Notr
Cant recommend it Disjointed editing too many wait what moments and performances that are lackluster Scenes often appear to be stitched together randomly and when theres no action its rather dull Effects are naturally over the top but in some instances theyre muddled,Notr
Another miss for this otherwise great actor The story is interesting but delivery is below average for high budget and box office movie which is visible by overuse of CGI If the screenplay was more focused on troubled dr Morbius and let the actors do what they do best act that would certainly deliver the whole different movie With some movies its better not try to please all the audience some may be left to adults and not to cut all the blood and gore so the children can watch it That way you get sterile CGI movie but it still wont appeal to kids since they luckily still dont know the struggles about major life transformations and decisions which main character needs to endure There are some ok scenes and story is interesting so ,Notr
Alright its a superhero flick so you get what you get Good action good effects Jared Leto is great Plot iswell what are you going to do I wasnt bored nor overwhelmed Decent movie and not too long Altho def could have spent more time getting to know the protagonist and antagonist so you just had more feeling for them,Notr
I watched Morbius to humor my inner desire to see a movie that was so badly thrashed by social media To be honest the movie wasnt really that bad but it just didnt make sense and left more to be desired for in terms of complexityThis feels almost like an unfinished movie or like a script that was based on several different iterations of editing there were so many details that left me confused and not understanding howwhy things were taking place The plot is more like something that you would see in a VERY early super hero movie where things dont need to make sense they just need to be surmounting the viewers expectations I found myself laughing at how absurd parts of the plot were when I was explaining the movie to those who had not seen itSave yourself the time and dont watch this movie,Notr
I knew nothing about this movie before going so I had no expectations I thought it was a really fun movie to watch as a casual fan of Marvel movies I also saw The Batman recently and I actually found Morbius much more enjoyable to watch Batman was pretty cheesy to meSo I was pretty shocked afterward to see how poorly rated the movie is Yes the movie ended too soon it felt like it didnt have much of an ending However I just took that to mean that its a simple origin story setting up future movies Admittedly that is a lazy approach but its better than feeling like the movies being stretched too long with useless filler which I find the case with many filmsSo if you want to see a really fun movie with exceptional sound and visuals Morbius fits the bill for me Just dont expect a masterpiece or a profound story its clearly intended to be the first of many of the character although given the abysmal ratings maybe that wont happen as they intended,Notr
"Morbius displays the worst of modern cinema money over quality With a simple common but interesting plot the film wastes all its potential because it rushes everything The characters are really a hit or a miss some of them make unbelievably bad decisions The pace is good in the first two acts however in the final act the movie is shaken by rerecordings which becomes evident as there are scenes out of place Not to mention the dialogue
The action is weak strange effects sloppy editing terrible choreography and unnecessary slow motions joined by an unoriginal soundtrackGenerally performances were good Jared Leto is far from being the movies problem and Matt Smith is wronged by lack of character development villainAlthoug enterteining this film suffers from poor writing sloppy editing post production issues and the need to rush everything to promote future projects same old mistakes Sony continues to produce failure after failure",Notr
I have always known Morbius as a SpiderMan villain However going into this I knew they were going to change him up Rightfully so I get what they were going for They should have gone with a R rating This would have given it the edge this movie needed without going too far into horror Instead they go with Ole faithful PG and it sucks some of the life out of this one It doesnt take too long for Morbius to become Morbius and the special effects are GREAT With that being said there is something missing A great antagonist It felt forced like they HAD to go the way they did And that makes for a more predictable flick Which is what it was always gonna be I just wish they realized that as well You dont have to go to the theater to watch this one You can wait till it hits a streaming service Not awful but it could have been ALOT better,Notr
Look I was excited The opening scenes were promising and it started really good But as it went on the characters and plot were SO predictable and BORING The lines were boring the costumes were boring the cgi was actually pretty cool but everything else was so boring Now usually a good soundtrack redeems a movie but this one didnt Ugh Anyway I fell asleep in the last  minutes and missed the whole climax of the movie but I could have guessed what happened it was that predictable so no big deal The post credit scene saved the movie although a little confusing fits the theme though If you liked Twilight or What Is It Like To Be a Bat by Nagel youll enjoy this slightly more,Notr
Watched it at the st showing in my town with my daughter We both liked it Action movie with Vampires Nothing wrong with that It kind of reminded me of the old blade movies in a way Mix those with the st Venom movie and you got Morbius I honestly miss having some horror in my comic book movies like back in the day I get some people may want a long funny drawn out Marvel movie but thats just not this movie It moves along quickly explaining things as it goes Again nothing wrong with that It kept us both entertained for almost  hours,Notr
I found it enjoyable dont get the hate Its vampire mayhem without the seriousness and drama those movies have Great cast and kept me entertained Just take it as it is,Notr
Ive either seen worse movies or the hive mind mentality on the internet is stronger than ever This movie isnt even that bad Yes there are some pacing issues its heavily edited and it has a slow fairly simple plot but there are some impressive visuals and action scenes the subway scene and Matt Smith delivered an intimidating but campy performance which made the movie a lot better,Notr
I dont get why so many people are saying this is bad The villain was great battles were tense the plot was well paced Really good Please go watch it and you wont regret it at all,Notr
No Im not with the Its Morbin time crowdSo listen It is a horrible mess all the way through but the one thing it has going for it is that at some moments the VFXs are amazing out of  take it or leave it,Notr
Always love seeing Matt Smith Jared Harris and Al Madrigal but apart from them doing really with very little this was really poorI think Mark Kermode was absolutely right Matt Smith should have been the lead role I want Al Madrigal in cinemaIt was too dark The visual effects were a poor spin on The Matrix with disorientating focus reminiscent of the worst Michael Bay stylingThe story was wasnt very interesting The vampires didnt even look as good as Buffy The Vampire SlayerThe first maybe ten minutes made a familiar but not unwelcome attempt to ground the transformation with scifi detailing but it farcically descended in to fantasy in a way that way really jarring If it had the humor and fun of a usual Marvel outing maybe this would have been fine but with its self serious tone it just came off as lazyI really dont even think die hard Marvel and comic book fans would be in to thisIt did make want to watch Blade though to take the taste away,Notr
Total CGI fest that jumps the shark many times Also vampire bats do not tear animals apart They find a sleeping animal make a little nick and lick up some blood usually not even waking the animal Totally overdone and puerile,Notr
How many time the same story will be copied over and over again Its an copy from their own previous marvel stories Lab experiment something wrong super power Hero a villain a fight for good How in the hell the story is accepted in the first place to direct a movie Is it not clear they its a repeat of a repeat of a repeat Total brainless people involved in this project Very very bad,Notr
I love and movies with a Vampire twist Ive loved Jared Leto since My So Called Life so I was more than happy to see this movie Im not sure why so many people are disappointed but I purchased it today and Im very happy with my purchase Ive already watched it twiceI will keep my fingers crossed for a second Morbius even though people are being so negative His character is right the few against the many Good luck Jared,Notr
So is Morbius as bad as the critics claim I would like to differ to that opinion Yes you cannot compare it to movies like Black Panther Avengers or even any SpiderMan MCU movie but it is an entertaining movie I would say its better than a lot of those mediocre superhero movies Yeah the postcredits dont make sense but thats not the movie right I like the acting by both Matt Smith and Jared Leto their chemistry is great Jared Leto gave his all The acts are not that well differentiated but the fight sequences are great especially the slowed ones it just feels like an immersive experience I like the way the powers of vampires are portrayed The movie feels like a typical superhero movie with a backstory and a proper conclusion I dont know what the fuss is all about Though yeah if you expect an avengers level movie you will be disappointed a lot but you know not to expect that its a lowbudget superhero movie I hope my opinion makes you alteast try you watch that on an ott and not on the cinema But well lets see what Sony can do,Notr
"Morbius is one of those movies that is good when it is good amazing when it is amazing and bad when it is bad what I mean by that is there are some parts where it is truly amazing there are some parts when it is good or just okay but when it is bad it is bad very b
ad especially during the times where he is riding his journal  diary that drags on forever However the amazing moments make up for it every time Matt Smith and Jared Leto on screen together it is a amazing scene and they are on screen together quite a lot There are some story details that drag on and it is kind of a lackluster origin story On the other hand if you look at it for what it is and admire the amazing action scenes then it is a great movie Like I said when it is good it is just good when it is amazing it is truly amazing and what it is bad it is very bad",Notr
Maybe cuz I grew up in the s and s this would he a decent TV movie I would watch So I dont understand the bad repFirst off the acting is not half bad especially by Jared Leto Second a vampire Marvel character is interesting I wonder if there could be collaborations with Werewolf By NightIt should be noted that the plot is neither mind blowing nor bad Its a cookie cutter plot for an origin story Thats not bad Its just that the Marvel audience has had two decades experience with origin stories it mightve been better not to be so lazy and to serve up a more unique way to tell the story Im not sure that I can point to things that are bad More like the delivery was just mediocre as was the overall experience primarily because there was nothing new save for the vampire angle if truth be told,Notr
Again letto provides a poor over the top performance Average scriptonly redeeming quality of the film is Matt smith a quality performance of a poor script An example of what not to do with a marvel film Strange but it feels more like a boring dc movie than a marvel film This film would sit nicely in the dc universe as its dull boring and takes its self to seriously,Notr
I really enjoyed the actors specially Jared Leto Very impressive indeed I like his styleThe movie was entertaining although geared towards a younger audience in my opinion which is odd for movies staring LetoThe visual effects however were very over the top I understand that they were supposed to convey the bat senses but they were very very over done,Notr
The movie lacks a lot of elements from the beginning it is highly predictable and with a few plot holes If you dont pay attention to some details which are not obvious andor entirely clear in my opinion due to lazy writing or directing you will end up confused by the end of the movie,Notr
A typical example of a marvel film that because its not the best movie people have ever seen they rate it a one star I can only assume these are reviews written by children or the very young The film is a solid piece of entertainment good acting effects and characters No its not up there with End Game but it shouldnt have to be Still a decent film and worth a watch The sort is a little formula driven but this doesnt detract from the overall enjoyment Leto is pretty good as is Smith both realistically portraying their characters My review is honest as is the number of stars awarded,Notr
Its pretty much the exact same thing that happened last time Leto did a comic book movie Im sure its another thing his rich parents paid for him to get into Didnt fit the role storyline fail wasnt entertaining all of it all over again,Notr
People are just given it a bad review just to jump on the bandwagon Im a big Marvel fan and I liked the movie I think people are so use to the Jokes after jokes after jokes these new marvelDisney movies they have been producing where every marvel character is funny So when you see a darker toned movie from them thats not family friendly people dont like it I think the pacing was good I was tuned in Its also the fact Hes not a big name like SpidermanThor However for a standalone movie it wasnt bad but because people dont know Morbius I think it would of helped if they had cameos of others like blade etc Or they should of had him introduced into someone elses movie first like how Black Panther was introduced in the avengers movies I think you should see it for yourself everybody has their own taste I like the darker side of Marvel like Blade Spawn Ghost Rider Punisher etc,Notr
Weak story felt like the pilot to a tv show that would never be picked up Jared Leto is dog water in everything hes in they need to stop casting him for these types of movies,Notr
Dont get all the bad reviews I liked it thought it was different and action packed when it needed to be  It wasnt a movie that dragged on but I thought it was short and sweet,Notr
When I watched this movie I felt like I had watched something similar before Oh wait It was SpiderMan and it was way betterThe only reason you should watch this movie is to tell your friends Its Morbin time and also not to watch it themselves,Notr
I dont know why people dont like this moviethis movie not masterpiecebut this movie is amzingbest entertainment i like this movie more than some other marvel moviessometime i think why people dont like because comic is more than powerful filmi didnt readbut i think,Notr
There are  parts of my life Before Morbius and after Morbius I have been a different person since I watched this movie It has been mixed with my blood This movie is what I live for and what I will live for This movie is so great that I cant rewatch it because it will never feel the same I sometimes just sit and think about it for hours and actually feel myself in deep really deep in myself This film got me out of a depression and it has been really supportive ever since Maybe my depression wasnt about my gf breaking up with me Maybe it was about not watching Morbius after it released This is really deep for me We all have the morb sometimes for me its morbin time and it will be morbin time,Notr
I expected the worse movie ever The ending is not very satisfactory and post credit scenes are as lame as they can be However I must say I didnt get bored and it is a good movie if that is what youre looking forThe acting is ok the effects are a little lame and there are actions scenes where you dont know what the hell is going on But again I wasnt expecting a master piece and it is just fine compared with some Marvel movies The female lead is a highlight and Leto does a good job Certainly it can be better but it is not the horrible film that some critics make it out to be At least it is not boring and that is  of the goal of superhero movie,Notr
I dont understaind SONY dont see what result has with his production Why they dont let MARVEL do the movies They simply destroy Spiderman univers,Notr
Matt Smith is a talented actor and a man that I find visually and audibly appealing he carries this movie by playing a character with little depth and wasted potential  but there is that one dancing scene and the fangs lowkey had me foaming at the mouthBad boring weak watch inaccurate and a little bit insulting to the comics But hell Matt Smith is in it and his hair and body look greatWould never watch again pretty trash and I love monster looking vamps  none of that twilight rubbish  and abs that dont sparkleOh yeah and that one guy that appears in fight club and literally every movie in existence is in it Jared  the guy that never f learned how to read be a protagonist in a decent movieCB,Notr
Nowhere near as bad as Blade Trinity Elektra Ghostrider XMen The Last Stand Apocalypse Dark Pheonix Suicide Squad Venom  etc There were some minor flawed plotpoints but for most part I liked it,Notr
I gave this movie a shot despite hearing bad things about it and it was the let down I heard about I think the main criticism I can give this movie is that its just boring the movie isnt long but it just seems to drag the action is there but its not great and the story just seems to drag and is a utter mess Even with Matt Smith someone who I like even he couldnt shine in this movie Unfortunately its not a great movie and its disappointing what sony is doing with the SpiderMan universe although I liked the Venom movies this just isnt good I was intrigued that they brought Adrian Toomes in the credit scene well see what that brings,Notr
This movie is not trying to be what its not Its a fun comic book flick about an ambiguous hero and it knows itThe visuals are great the story is not perfect but engaging enough I loved the costume choices for the characters the overall mood  eerie at times thrilling curious Great showcase of Morbiuss powers Remarkable acting from Matt Smith as well as from other actors The touch of horror was just perfect  it wasnt too scary but it was enough to make you twitchI loved it It was fun,Notr
I truly am sad that this film was done the way it was Everything was less than average for  The story telling and CGI were the worst part of the film Someone who worked on The amazing spiderman  mustve worked on Morbius because it has very similar flaws which reminded me of The amazing spiderman  the whole time I was watching Really sad,Notr
I honestly thought it was a really good film It did often feel a bit lacking in real character development or storyline There were a few characters i really expected them to do more with and when they didnt it was frustrating Obviously because of all of this i do understand its negative reviews but with that said i was still completely captivated The acting was great The effects were interesting Would definitely watch againin fact i would genuinely love to see a sequel if they fleshed it out properly with some meaningful side and background characters and maybe a bit more depth for morbius himself Overall i gave it  because despite a lot of lacking areas it was a really good movie and a fun watch I hope they take it further and not let this be the last we see of morbius,Notr
Im not entirely convinced it was good or bad Jared Leto did a good job but lacked some depth imissed a deeper story over allBut if you want a simple movie night with your hubbie  go for it,Notr
"I went and saw Morbius in theaters today despite the less than mediocre reviews The movie had a great amount of potential yet lacked in execution The plot and effects were subpar but I still found enjoyment in the world the movie takes place in and the drive morbius has for finding a cure to his disease Despite being a marvel villain origin movie it lacks the feel of one Morbius is more of a light take on the thriller genre I feel that Morbius needed a better sense of direction or purpose as it could be all over the place at times I feel the movie came to a quick conclusion not letting many events develop into what couldve been Overall seeing this movie was a decent experience but not a memorable one I didnt feel any sort of attachment towards any of the characters as I dont think they had a very strong presence or importance Morbius is not a movie I would necessarily recommend to anyone that isnt interested in the movieConcept

Cured my cancer Cancer cells left my body right at the cinema and apparently went to see new Batman I didnt want to live though so only Finally a vampire movie without blood its definitely a step forward waiting for a vampire movie without vampires and Jared Leto movie without Jared Leto,Notr
This movie had so much action and also it had lots of twists and turns but the ending was bad I prefer to see a much happier ending then that so but however its marvel what can I say,Notr
"Just watched the movie dont know why this movie gets less attention I just enjoyed every bit Action sequences are amazingcasts everything is nice
Morbius ",Notr
Ive seen people absolutely trashing this movie and it really isnt bad Some of them seem to have a personal vendetta against Jared Leto and it is clearly influencing their ratings of this movieIf you had fun with The Last Witch Hunter or Gods of Egypt same writers then youll probably have some fun with this movie tooThe story isnt trying to be art its only try to be entertainment And lets face it half of the Marvel movies at least are totally unremarkable and uninspired The only real difference between this movie and those is that Morbius the character doesnt have millions of rabid fans who blindly buy tickets and praise everything with his name on it,Notr
This movie had nothing to be desired Started off decent but then became more and more drawn on and just boring Lacked a good story and good action scenes As well the villain story was so predictable Mediocre at best,Notr
"A much cooler indie vibe film compared to Wakanda Forever including Thor Love and Thunder I also enjoyed the almost european tone of the movie The visual effects especially on Michael Morbius transformation were just perfectly refreshing compared to the recent MCU movies which are too over the top with too
Much green screen written all over it Sure you would think its too Batman but only because of the bat scenes Otherwise it can hold on its own I only wish it was a longer film with more action scenes to go with it I truly hope Morbius  is going to happen soon I will be the first in line",Notr
"Just a few points
Studios clearly too involved in the film feels like the films missing an hourShould have stayed a horror film as it was leaning into during the beginning but then just dropped it for an action movieCharacter has no real downside to ability especially compared to his comic originsThe action is a jumbled cgi mess of random slomos and distortion effectsR rated would have given ability to save this mess but studios chickened out",Notr
God bless Jared Leto This made me nut my pants  Hope to see this skin in Fortnite Jareds performance reminded me of his performance in Requiem for a Dream That movie sucked Who cares about a bunch of addicts Vampires is where its at,Notr
Simple story and stylish look But the substance is lacking in the product as a whole The editing does not fit with the movie making it feel BGradeCharacters and acting is okay But too many scenes do not follow the rules set by the story and some moments do not make sense or just feel like Here Watch the next partMy claypot nachoes and recliner were my favourite parts of the movie,Notr
Really enjoyed this but when it came to the ending and it all went at light speed and really rushed Leto was good as morbius and the special effects were great too mat smith was good as milo but I just cant get around the ending being so off base its a shame really Hopefully the next one will be good all the way through,Notr
This movie is now my number  favourite movieSorry cuaron but children of men isnt as kino as morbiusJared leto is good in this movie He really is the best actor now Also that we are venom joke is so awesome and funny I cried in this movie  times,Notr
Actually quite a typical superhero movie with a stereotyped plot that wasnt as bad as the reviews and ratings suggested Didnt expected much but the CG and actions were decent the acting wasnt bad as well and I found this rather enjoyable Though the story is quite similar to other superhero movies this is honestly better than venom and the batman and even some mcu garbage like black panther and shangchi that gets a ridiculously high phony rating Fairly speaking this should worth a  which the rating again wrongly reflect on like most of the movies as a lot the raters and critics are just a bunch of pretentious kids without much sense,Notr
Haha his movie is absolutely horrible Nothing redeeming Yet another Jared Leto movie that is trash Dudes a terrible actor and his movies are bad Its about time to stop seeing anything with him in it,Notr
Its been a long time since Ive been to the movies This one did not disappoint Non stop action Highly recommendUltimate vampire fight Good vs evil,Notr
Firstly yes I am a fan of the MCU franchise but this is quite separate from that down to the teams that created this film That being said Morbius is a decent movie understand the harsh criticisms are because people associate this with the MCU thus the bar is set so highOtherwise if you liked the likes of Venom I dont see how you cant fail to enjoy this Yes theres some incoherence and the fact that a vampire movie can have such little if not any bloodbut looking beyond that and seeing this for what it isthe birth of the flawed antihero that is Morbius,Notr
This movie is like a bad twilight movie all over again The movie egged along and it was such a boring movie basically reminded me of a snooze fest The plot was boring and they waited way to long in the movie to reveal the villain which made it unenjoyable I said batman was not great but this takes icing on the cake for one of the worst movies ive seen in theaters,Notr
After watching this movie I was so disappointed Morbius is a cool character with an interesting backstory personality so on The beginning was pretty solid but it dropped for the rest of the movie The middle has absolutely nothing happening in it and the climax was a confusing battle The fight scene in the climax was very confusing due to not knowing what is going on just a bunch of rubble flying around on the screen Overall this is a terrible movie though it had potential it flopped after the first  minutes,Notr
