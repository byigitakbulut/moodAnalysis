The movie is not that bad I dont understand all that hate I remember watching it in the theaters few years ago and I loved itThe movie is not that bad go and watch if you want to download the found reviews talk to you,Negative
I hate this movie so much It wasted such perfectly good voice actors and it was a waste of product placement Man it ripped off Wreckit Ralph The Lego Movie and Inside Out The jokes are just stupid Sure the animation was fine and all but still,Negative
"The plot is not exactly stellar however the performances are good and the jokes are funny and smart
It is relevant to the present even though not exaclty easy to relate to the characters
The message of the movie is also a nice one inspirational and motivational
In any case the movie does not have any serious flaws rhat would make it a  stars movie it hds the storyline together and coherent as said it is smart and funny
If you came across on this movie on TV do not chnage the chanel it is worth the watch",Negative
Dont watch it youll waste your life Watch Spiderverse instead,Negative
Is the Emoji Movie the best movie ever made YesI saw this movie in Japanese captions,Negative
I doubt anyone expected this movie to be Citizen Kane but I have to say it at least didnt put me to sleep Unlike Citizen KaneThe premise of creating a film around emojis is extremely thin however the result is suprisingly fun with some very good casting choices such as Tim Miller The moral of the story is a bit of a miss but I doubt this was the reason most people saw thisIt also goes to show that Patrick Stewart is up for a laugh by allowing himself to be cast as the poop emoji by far the most unique role hes ever taken onOverall its great mindless fun for people of all ages and well worth at least one viewing,Negative
This is pure art I dont need words for context You can just tell by the beautiful and meaningful title depicting the innocent and dreamlike lives of the Emojis ,Negative
"I am not paid by sony or the producers so this is a real review
the movie had a good story like every other movie the animation was pretty good and the jokes were pretty funny ",Negative
So bad I cant even find words to describe it Why Funny Nope Exciting Nope Did we learn something Yeah never ever watch The Emoji Movie again And Hollywood has too much money And NEVER EVER watch this crap again,Negative
Its hard to overstate how bad this is A stellar comedic cast and any one of them could have created a better movie if it was just  minutes of them reading the phone bookDo not ever watch this,Negative
Just awful The jokes didnt land the animation was dull and uninspired the characters when they werent being incredibly annoying were one note and clich Really who on earth had the idea to make a movie about emoji Not only all this but the film is so much a copy of other kids films its not even funny Half the time I wasnt sure if I wasnt the Emoji Movie or WreckitRalph A far superior film Dont waste your time on this The fact that a Popeye movie was canceled for this after the incredible footage released is criminal,Negative
I feel like this movie had a good message for kids and well everyone I dont understand why it was so hated My family and I were really hoping for a sequel I think people need to give this another chance,Negative
I just want to start this by saying I went into this with zero expectations because of all the reviews I was amazed when I watched it I found myself genuinely loving it I thought it was a very fun kids movie I think people sometimes dislike things because they think it is cool but one thing I was taught from a very young age was to not be too cool to enjoy things I know it sounds cheesy but I swear some people just dislike because everyone else dislikes it too I am not saying that you have to like or thats the reason why everyone say they dislike Im just saying try not to be negative Its a great movie that is nothing more than it needs to be It does have some bad parts like a bit too much consumerism but it is so feel good This is just my personal opinion but think twice before you decide the movie is going to bad,Negative
Im shocked this is rated so poorly The movie was enjoyable and fun and great for kids Was this a dramatic masterpiece sure to win awards No Of course not it was not intended to be that sort of movie It is the story of a broken emojis quest to become unbroken He must journey through different apps on the phone in order to reach the cloud On this journey we get to see an imaginative view of what different apps could look like if the were real It is pretty clever really The Emoji Movie is full of humor the joke about the elderly is HILARIOUS and it has Steven Wright voicing the main characters father I think this movie is definitely worth watching if you have kids Theyll love it and I would think the parents would enjoy it too,Negative
Gene couldnt be meh but this movie made me meh Turned it off after  or  minutes and I was watching it for free One of the worst things recorded to film Ive ever had the displeasure of letting come into contact with my cornea,Negative
"This is this kind of movie that you think you would love it but when you watch it you realize that its total disaster This movie doesnt have any story I expected that this movie will show that having friends and connecting with people in the real world it is more important than texting emojis on your telephone
In my opinion this is the worst movie I ever saw",Negative
You look at this title page and think Oh what a cute movie about emojis You watch the film and think I want my life back This movie contains a ridiculous plot that sounds like the creators are just trying to sell about  emoji pillows The plot isnt even that clear and its hard to understand why anyones doing anything in the first place The interactions between characters are weird and unnaturalBut lets start from the obvious This film contained two game tutorials and three demonstrations You can practically see a little four year old thinking about how great Dropbox is as they watch this excuse for a motion pictureYou would assume a movie to be enjoyable artistic original and funny The Emoji Movie is none of these things Absolutely unoriginal  a typical story about someone who doesnt fit in None of the jokes in this entire movie even made me smile It is an insult to the arts When you put all that I have said together you can assume that it was not enjoyable eitherI beg you not to pay to have one hour and thirtyone minutes of your life wasted,Negative
"We live in a society 
Also the main character Gene is hot",Negative
Ever sincethat fateful day on July th my life has changed eternally  of my time awake is devoted to watching this as everything else I do is immensely boring and sad compared to the genius that is Emoji,Negative
Not much else to say Nothing is good about this movie I guess the animation was good kinda sad the animators tried,Negative
This movie has  stars because some rewievers find it funny to give this wreck  stars it dont even deserve that much i knew it would be horrible its a movie about emojis nothing good can come out from such a bad idea but it was actually worse than i expected usually i can laugh about atleast something or find some jokes clever this movie had none of those moments and the vague hints of a femenist message really didnt help whos brilliant idea was it that the female character should say You know women are always coming up with stuff that men are taking credit for when she didnt even say it sure it was implied that was her idea but its so stupid to make it about men taking womens ideas and it was even more obvious what the movie wanted you to think when yet again the female character says later in the movie im not going to be a princess waiting for my prince charming overall a horrible movie with alot stolen from other movies and whats originat is unfunny and bad dont watch it,Negative
The movies message is that communication among people is failing and can only be saved by texting with more emojisHow about face to face conversations,Negative
The movie starts off with a horrible intro The whole is just a cliche and the plot is what you expect an emoji goes around a lot of apps we use and they use subtle hints to womens rights Theres a fine line between a childs movie and a fake PG movie This movie crosses it many time over,Negative
Perfect story telling where you use no original ideas or settings or characters or lines or jokes So you dont have to use the two Brain cells you have,Negative
Best mocie ever period no cap the goat of movies,Negative
This movie is aimed at children and my daughter enjoyed it a lot While the movie wasnt great or even really good for an adult it was nowhere close to as bad as Angry Birds or Boss Baby I expect it to be worse than most of the nonDisney nonPixar stuff I saw one reviewer compare it unfavorably to Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out but come on why is that comparison even being made Those are GREAT movies in their genre This is a  It held my attention without irritating me while my  year old enjoyed herself Jokes didnt all hit but the inside the phone software metaphors was more on the mark than the vast majority of live action portrayals of virtual worlds Frankly I think the script needed maybe a couple more rounds of rewrites and it would have been above average,Negative
At one point in the movie they were facing the firewall It was a pit bull song where it says Im a fireball when it clearly shouldve been Im a firewallOverall the movie was meh,Negative
This film is more than a film Its art Out of the many outstanding qualities the themes are the most impressive It serves as a reflection on our own society the breaking of norms and the oppressive Orwellian government pushing whats different down True authenticity is a rarity in our culture with the transcendent message of the film and the innovative concept and animation The way this film was done has never been done before Ever There is literally nothing like it Focusing instead on making a masterpiece rather than making money instead of being an half assed ad like Anomalisa The Emoji restores my faith in film and in turn restores my faith in humanity Definitely deserves its own cinematic universe  out of ,Negative
Well maybe this isnt the best animation I have seen but it has some great moments and the good thing with kids is that they typically transfers their enthusiasm to their surroundings and that makes the experience better Location seating  time Palads Kbenhavn Denmark  Bio  row  seat       at ,Negative
Before seeing this film I had had only  girlfriends but now that I can converse about the fine arts I have   would recommend,Negative
This movie is an hour and a half long advertisement There was no reason or idea behind this movie but rather they needed an excuse to just shamelessly plug things,Negative
By God this is a masterpiece An absolutely gorgeous movie about Gene an emoji who does not fit in Join him and his friends as they travel through the phone which does not have obvious distasteful product placements at all Will he forever be an outsider or fit in like what eventually happens in all childrens movies Masterfully executedThis movie only gets  because it ended If only it went on evermore it would get  Truly the pinnacle of human civilisation,Negative
I saw this movie to see how bad it was and it was a terrible terrible mistake This movie is basically what would happen if you put Inside Out Wreck it Ralph crap garbage and an iPhone in a blender then put it it in the oven took out the result nuke it then put the ashes back in the oven and the emoji movie comes out Do not watch this movie Ever,Negative
This movie was a mistake in all senses of the word The animation was pretty good Ill give it that but the writing and quality control of the voice acting and screenplay was abysmal The only benefit to this movie was the reaction of the internetSony Pictures Animation has fallen so very far,Negative
Trash Thats what this movie is Dont even bother watching Save yourself,Negative
My kids are making me watch this deck on Netfrix as I type this If the Lord is ready to receive me into His kingdom I am definitely ready to go,Negative
This movie is god awful i dont understand why  people rated the movie  in a row in the user reviews maybe these accounts were created to bump up the ratings of this awful movie besides what movie is entertaining with James Cordon in the cast,Negative
Regardless of low ratingits a very good cartoon with an interesting story and satisfying conclusion,Negative
The Emoji Movie is about the Meh emoji Gene played by talented actor TJ Miller It has everything youd want out of a movie conflict good characters engaging story and a happy ending Without spoiling this masterpiece I can tell you that Gene goes through an epic adventure where he grows as an Emoji I dont have any kids because I hate them but the kids in the theater seemed to enjoy themselves even after I accidentally spilled my soda on them hahaha It is definitely worth a watch if you ask meYa boi Tony,Negative
Even though It has low rating and Is made fun of a lot It was actually enjoyable I watched this movie with my friend In theaters and I was thinking It would be an awful movie that I could make fun of but then It was actually pretty enjoyable There are a few kinda cringy parts such as some of the dancing scenes but it was still an enjoyable movie My serious rating ,Negative
People DO NOT listen to the people that gave this film  It might be obvious that those guys must be paid by Sony to rate this So try managing your review setting so you can avoid them But if you want to YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED,Negative
Bringin back  in an absolute catastrophy of a movie,Negative
"I got so bored while watching it that while it was still playing i made this IMDb account just to rate it  star This movie is the reason why IMDb needs to add a  star rating
There has been an experiment in which a person is shocked when he touches a button says that hes never going to touch it then he gets put in a room with the button and they get so bored that they touch the button multiple times just because they have nothing better to do
Now if they repeat this experiment but this time they replace the electric shock and the button with the Emoji Movie its going to bring in media attention and lawsuits because its unethical to lock up a person in the same room as this horrendous movie",Negative
Ive never seen such an unrelevant movie before Its just so dumb and nonsensical it is like a bad mix of the Lego movie and Pixels Just do not watch it,Negative
OK I went in expecting the absolute worst from this movie as I was purchasing my ticket however as I got sat down I began to reolise all my worries were for nothing I really liked the movie it kept me entertained I dont know what the hell most of America saw but I laughed out loud more than once and my fave emoji was the badass jailbreak I say take the family go by yourself just ignore the critics and see this movie,Negative
There are only  of the reviews are positive Do not believe them There is a reason this movie sucks I may not be explaining it right here but read the other reviews here,Negative
Very good yes i like the part where he does the thing,Negative
Please dont listen or watch or read the reviews for this incredible movie I guarantee these folks didnt see the movie they are just upset it was an amazing experience like the one I had For weeks I have been awaiting this gem to arrive at my local theater house For weeks I have been ranting and raving and just having pure excitement knowing my girl Sophia will be costarring The movie is well directed and the score goes right to the heart of my soul I loved how the movie had credits at the beginning and end I enjoyed the message and I wasnt let down I stayed in the theater for  consecutive showings until I was removed by the usher I highly recommend this movie be a part of your legacy,Negative
I went into this movie expecting it to be rubbish but I certainly wasnt expecting the astoundingly high amount of blatant racism and homophobia in it especially during the first and third act I specifically recall the scene where after praising Elliot Rodger as a hero Gene and Jailbreak tell all LGBT members in the film that they didnt deserve love then proceed to have a massive orgy with the rest of the characters which was extremely disturbing and totally inappropriate for children I cant believe Sony allowed Tony Leondis to get away with this appalling piece of cinema,Negative
Probably one of the worst movies to ever exist Please do not waste your money on watching this movie Its is not worth your time,Negative
Just a terrible movie who makes money off cool and hip emojis,Negative
This is the worst movie Ive ever seen in my life,Negative
I would rather break all my Jones in my boy than watch this horror movie i hate it,Negative
"This movie is pure trash Its just so sad that a bunch of people came in and thought this was a good idea The whole movie is one big ad
and its literally trying to make a full on scene just by making ads I cant believe someone just sat there and thought No ones gonna notice the ads I just feel really bad for all the people who had to suffer watching this movie Im just so sadHumanity is doomedReally humanity is gonna get nowhere with this kind of Movie Seriously how can you even consider this a movie and not just one fat adAlso The Emoji Movies storyboard feels like it was written for  minutes until they pitched the idea Just one fat try to make money by advertising companies in an awful MovieIf you ask me the poop emoji shouldve been the main character because he represents this Movie amazingly  At least I can laugh at all the jokes they make off this Movie",Negative
"Hello there I took my three grandchildren to the cinema the other day to see the Emojee Movie and my kids LOVED IT They said this is bound to be a meme which is a silly word meaning the greatest My youngest daughter got frightened by the scary viruses reminiscent of the ones on my Windows Vista But my other kids ATE IT UP Very funny plot about the cell phone also i love candy crush They said the day after that Jacksfilms is the movies biggest fan But I am reigning supremeSincerely
Donna W Emogee Movie connoisseur",Negative
I went with my  year old daughter and we both liked it Its not excellent but its an action paced animated movie that feels goodThe plot is at least original Sure it has lots of product placement but it couldnt be otherwise Actually the movie is all about product placement But thats OK thats actually how it relates to the audience that know each app on our smartphone and you use them everyday And thats actually what makes it interesting and compelling How could a movie about your phone be with fake names and fake apps it wouldnt make senseHowever the action felt like they were just passing each level from one app to the other until the final destination And its not that funny but it has some nice funny lines that make you smile but not laugh My kid laughed a bit with the easy jokes Positive points for the animation liked the Instagram bit especially for the really nice D feelDespicable Me  is funnier Cars  is more adventurous But Emoji relates more to the audience and to the real life,Negative
"This movie is easily the worst of all time
I mean I would rather watch The Room than watch thisSeriously its awfulDont and I mean itDONt WATCH THIS MOVIEI wish I could give it lower than a one",Negative
"If you would like to watch an hour and a half long commercial then this is the movie for you The entire film revolves around these brand deals they were able to acquire such as Candy Crush Just Dance and Spotify Even if it doesnt make sense for the plot and what is happening for these brand deals to be brought in to the movie they are still included Its like watching a YouTube video with mid roll ads that interrupt the video
The plot itself is very common and not nearly as different or interesting enough as many other films with this format The characters are bland and forgettable since they are literally the same characters as your regular outcast hero characters If you want to see a good version of this film watch Wreck It Ralph While that film isnt the exact same as this it is quite similar and much more intriguing and interesting I cant even think of a single thing I liked about this film thats just how bad it was",Negative
" PREDICTABLE STORY LINE
 BLANDunlikable CHARACTERS
 CRINGEWORTHY JOKES
go watch wreck it Ralph its way better",Negative
I find it strange how most of the  come from accounts that have only rated this movie,Negative
This movie if great for kids I enjoy watching it too The only thing that sort of bothered me is the underlying message It has a little of the PC feel but doesnt push it too hard You know the everybodys trying to stay in their expected social cues and anyone that breaks from the patriarch will be hunted down and killed That PC But your kids will love it and shouldnt read between the lines I ask you not to either Just enjoy the movie for what it is Dumb fun with some really cool moments and understanding of what really happens when we press the little emoji button on our phones,Negative
Its horrible dont watch it The only good thing about it is that its consitant Consistantly bad,Negative
Its a different movie from I have watched before As an expert in animated movies I can tell you you wont regret it,Negative
Watched this with a bus full of  year olds Thank you God for the experience of a lifetime and have a good day,Negative
In what universe is it ethical to make a movielength advertisement and then market it to children,Negative
The Emoji Movie is notorious for being awful And considering I love to occasionally watch an awful film in order to get a good laugh I decided to finally see this piece of dreck Overall it was a terrible movie but perhaps not as terrible as I expected It ended up being more tedious than painful to watchSo whats wrong with this movie The writing Despite the film being all about emojis the writers managed to hit every possible cliche a kids movie could use And considering these are emojis it just didnt make sense to stick so close to a rather overused formula Additionally the film had what seemed like hundreds of jokes relating to computers and social mediaand each and every one of them fell flat And several of these jokes involved the poop emoji This is because in none of these was there even a hint of humor or cleverness I noticed one review where the reviewer gives this one a  Thats like saying that a velvet Elvis painting belongs in the Louvre,Negative
It suucks Nothin is good from graphics to story to music never watching again,Negative
"Let the truth be told sony just laid a dump on all of us poor sound animation was good but its lacking a bit
if it would be released before some animated movies it would be good but this was a real disappointment",Negative
This is the greatest movie I have ever seen I think that this was even better than cool cat saves the kids I was hesitant to watch this movie but after I the commercials for the candy crush part My Favorite GameI had to see this so I forced my kids into the car and made them watch the whole movie ,Negative
Frick you sony You make me sick To call this video a film is honestly insulting to to every movie ever made yes including The Amazing Bulk The obvious pandering is just the start it tries to pull Blatant advertising of apps unfunny jokes and the most basic plot ever I hate the emoji movie,Negative
OK no offense but to everyone saying this is stupid and who came up with this stupid idea  this world is dead Etc we are the world and we are the future if you think this movie sucked than do something about it and start using your creativity and change the future I thought it was OK for kids it was innocent,Negative
Yeah this movie is just absolute garbage like seriously a movie about literal things you send in chats this movie is pretty corny and stupid as well the plot is about a cornball simp the movie just sucks and a princess emoji thats being hunted What is even the point of this movie existing the person who made this should be ashamed and  million US dollars to make such a terrible movie is suck a waste like yeah it made a good amount of money like  million us dollars but movie was just bad man I watched this in  and saw how corny it was and i just didnt watch it also this movie sucked I wish I could give zero,Negative
Everyone thinks this movie is st but its actually good Just enjoy it Remember its just an animation just for fun and dont take it too seriously,Negative
Me and  other friends went to see this movie and we all agreed that it was cringy but also good at the same time which is the reason why i am giving this movie its deserved rating me and my  other friends that saw this movie too i also think that this movie shouldnt have replaced the popeye movie too,Negative
Decent plo great cast and good performances but not enough to merit this being anything above average for me as an animated movieConcept is cool and relatable for the overall family Its coherent and does entertains at the level its supposed toI dont agree with the very low ratings but dont see this being an amazing or needle mover A great fun time if you wanna laugh and enjoy a witty comical creative movieEasy to relate to with good characters that offer humour and motivationIf you see this on tv definitely watch it It just may not be worth the price of renting lolEnjoy,Negative
To be honest it wasnt so bad the emojis animation looks good but the whole thing reminds me about wreck it Ralf but more lame Because wreck it Ralf has a whole story line and a lot more memes and wider perspective while this movie is only a childish entertainment which is really a bad choice Heres why who do you think will watch this movie Sure adults might understand the jokes inside about internet and stuff but not really and the whole story line is weird and the love between jailbreak and Jean is awkward super awkward If you say this is for kids no because they cant even understand the memes and jokes about internet and social medias its just boring for them And for teenagers Its just lame,Negative
So I watched this movie a couple times and I heard before watching it Its Bad Or Its Horrible So anyways I watch it and the whole thing was okayBut I really dont understand why its rated  stars I mean Its not that bad but I would recommend And it was just Stupid a little bit but funny at the same time,Negative
Should you watch this if youre a adult alone no Should you watch this whit children yes for kids at the age form  to  this is a enjoyable movie I was very skeptical about this movie because of the reviews i watched it today whit two young children and the enjoyed it Watching this movie whit them made this movie a lot better The animation was good the pasting was ke it was very colorful almost neon a clear sign that this movie is for very small children The story is simple easy to follow for kids Is this a animation masterpiece no it is not inside out its not Up Its just a movie for very small children,Negative
This was so boring I turned it off after half an hour,Negative
Christopher Nolan will never reach this level of writing its an absolute masterclass of fictionthis will change lives MARK MY WORDS,Negative
DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE I DID AND I WILL NEVER GET THOSE  MINUTES BACK,Negative
"The story Incredibly cliched
The jokes not funny and sometimes to the point where it doesnt even make any sense I still wake up in cold sweats about the clock one
The characters every bad kids movie character combined
The message be yourself Gee how innovative and creative also theres an out of place feminism theme thats just jarring
Animation is the only good thing about this dumpster fire Please dont watch this",Negative
It is not that bad as the media describes it it was kinda good to be honest,Negative
Its just bad horrible terrible please avert your eyes from this movie,Negative
Okay this isnt the BEST movie out there but I just wanted to say that it could have been a WHOLE LOT WORSE that it was I watched this movie purely because I was curious if it was bad as some people were making it out to be Its not I consider myself to be an adult and even I could relate to some of the messages that this film tried to convey and even appreciated their attempts as cheesy as they may have been at humour This film does in no way warrant the hate reviews that it has been receiving as of late Its aimed at a YOUNGER easiertoplease sugarcrazed crowd of little tweens and to them I can assure you this was gold Its a kids movie What on earth were you expecting,Negative
I dont understand the hate this movie gets I found it funny and charming Its a pretty clever idea emojis who are only allowed to be one thing I would recommend people watch it with an open mind before reading the reviews Its definitely a repeat movie for me I watch it all the time,Negative
I read the reviews of this film and thought I would never watch this film as the reviews were terrible and my sister convinced me to go and watch this I was dreading it however I came out of the screen thinking those terrible reviews were pretty terrible themselves as I laughed quite a few times and enjoyed this film so ignore negative reviews and take your kids to go and watch this film you will be surprised,Negative
Its a film about emojis or emoticons if you preferSo check your expectationsIt was cute enough My favorite part was Sir Patrick Stewart voicing the Poop EmojiWorth a rental if you have a young one that loves emojisNot the best movie in the world and definitely not the worst,Negative
THE EMOJI MOVIE IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME THERE IS NO MOVIE BETTER THAN THIS IT DESERVES THE OSCAR FOR BEST PICTURE IT IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIMEI mean come on Stale jokes Patrick Stewart as a turd  product placement a plot that goes absolutely nowhere lack of common sense anywhere throughout the movie Oh sure the FORMULA for a Best Picture winner I SERIOUSLY wonder just what exactly was going through the minds of the people who worked on this Lets be honest among movies considered the worst theres The Room which quite frankly puts a smile on my face and then theres this loadocrap a systematic braindrain Like I could actually take The Room seriously compared to whatever this was Hell The Emoji Movie shouldnt even have been thought of in the first place,Negative
Please dont watch this Dont I did It was horrible cringeful just plain bad Stay away from this movie its poison in your veins and will leave you confused and angry There is nothing redeeming in this movie the jokes are horrible the characters are just boring So boring but its not The Room bad Where its a bit funny No this is just so bad its bad There is no other way i can describe this level of bad,Negative
I do not recommend watching this movie because it just made me throw the phone out of the window When I see an Emoji I felt bad for the future generations because when you published this movie you proved that there is no hope left on earth and you have opened the gates of hell when this movie was published What is the next movie going to be The Snapchat Movie The rise of the Hotdog filter Also this movie is the reason why Ive lost the will to live If you have  for a ticket for this movie just spend it to cancer charities so cancer like this gets cured and nobody has to watch this  This movie was a crime to the humanity and whoever did this movie should be thrown in jail immediately,Negative
"It was entertaining
Fun to see different apps
Likable characters esp parentsA little too much music
Some parts held out way too long",Negative
I am being serious There IS something to them claiming that the US is the devil The more I read into it the more their cause seems plausible to me The movie is so stunningly bad it will be the major talking point in hushed and serious tones akin to talking about a new and unstoppable strain of Ebola across all known and unknown media It is an extinction level event all by itself Someone actually sat down and penned this terminal cancer I had to sit down through the entire sad affair because it was too horrible not to This movie is the  Hiroshima and Nagasaki of your soul,Negative
Dont tire yourself and read negative reviews it all a lies The movie is very good and funny I give it By the way this is my first review I ever made just because I was really angry why this movie get a lot of low rates,Negative
Wow Words cannot describe what I have just seen It is sad to see that Hollywood as sank this low in creating a filmThe worst part wasnt the clich dialogue or the terrible comedy It wasnt the predictable and recycled plot The worst part about this movie is that at one point a group of executives sat together in a board room and thought Whats something hip and cool that kids like and they all collectively agreed that and EMOJI movie would be the best ideaAt one point I was in the middle of watching this and I came to the sad realization that I was watching a movie about EMOJIS Overall this movie was a sad attempt at trying to keep up with the times and I hope that this is a Hollywoods final attempt at trying to do something like this,Negative
Combine WreckIt Ralph with Inside Out then remove everything food about those movies and youre left with thisIts a movie about emojis its as terrible as you think it will be,Negative
If I could give this movie a  i would This movie was so boring that I slept in the middle of it and I NEVER sleep through movies I wasted my  on this horrible movie DONT WATCH IT,Negative
"I love animated movies but this is just a complete disaster Dont see this movie ever in your life I watched this movie a while back and I hated every single thing about this movie First the jokes arent that funny Second most of the characters were really annoying and bland This is a complete ripoff of the LEGO Movie
The worst movie by Sony so far",Negative
Not nearly as bad as everyone says I dont get the hate behind it and Ive seen way way way worse Yes that alone doesnt make it a good movie but its not nearly bad enough to be called the worst animated movie of all time,Negative
Soulless movie created solely for the purpose of making money out of a fad Its not creative in the least and a waste of time Should have been released straight to netflix and skipped the theaters,Negative
Lol Im really not sure why this movie is so underrated I found it interesting maybe not really funny but some jokes were dark and not for kids which was kind of creepy but still the plot is nice The ending was also really good teaching everyone that you have to be yourself and dont pretend to be someone else Guilty pleasure Wasnt masterpiece but far away from bad movie,Negative
There was no plot character development was nonexistent Product placement was everywhere The romance was also so amazingly disappointing and probably shouldnt have even been in the movie I doubt I will ever have children knowing that they will grow up in a world where this is seen as actual entertainment and not a pile of poop emoji This isnt a  million dollar movie and looked like it had the budget of your average Bollywood film I doubt Ill ever see an emoji the same way as this mentally and emotionally scarred me to the point that I feel emotions have become obsolete Overall the movie was an utter waste of money I give it  OK hand emojis out of ,Negative
I honestly cant say that Im surprised AT ALL by the reactions of this movie because this was met with almost universal disdain from the pitch alone This is almost like a parody movie that youd find in a Family Guy cutaway or something not an actual product that should exist on this planet Hey have you seen Inside Out andor Wreckit Ralph Good you got yourself a double feature that you can watch instead of paying money to go see  MILLION get set on fire and watch it burn to ashes for  minutes This movie has only one of very very few redeeming traits and it is this ANYONE can get their movie in theaters regardless of talent quality or entertainment value for ages  and under if you throw enough money at it you too can play the same weekend as Atomic Blonde with the smug attitude of Yes people with common sense will see this,Negative
The Emoji movie is cancer Thats one word to sum it up Its very very bad and can not be redeemed at all Dont watch if you want to keep your brain cells,Negative
I actually kind of liked this movie I cant say its the new Shrek or something like that but it was kind of nice The story was clear and easy to understand Its childsafe and it has some easter eggs in it Par example the chase in Shrek with that dragon that gets entangled in her own chains I always enjoy it when people put easter eggs like that in their movie So this is my conclusion if youre ill and too tired to watch more complicated movies this is kind of nice Just keep a vomit bucket with you for during the ending scene That scene was just too sweet,Negative
Sonys film studio has manufactured another hit And thats all you will want after seeing this film To be hit as many times as possible with a rusty crowbar The cheapest sloppiest animation goes nicely with this unfunny unoriginal mess Dont spend your hard earned money and watch it to see how bad it is Pirate it if you really want to see how bad it is,Negative
 was an absolute golden experience would smash again,Negative
I watched this movie with the lowest possible expectations and was pleasantly surprised This movie is boring hilarious depressing and deep depending on the scenejoke Watch it with an open mind and prepare to be amazedchanged forever,Negative
Ugh another soulless product placement film with terrible characters and stupid plot dont waste your time with this These type of films need to be at the bottom of a Walmart bargain bin,Negative
I thought this movie could be atleast a little bit creative but it isnt in the sligthest I found my self having to use my phone during the whole movie cause I was so bored Very lousy job of Sony animation studios,Negative
Yep you read the title This movie is not worth it This movie is about an oddoneout emoji whos supposed to be meh that lives in a phone ORIGINAL IDEA but makes a mistake and stuff so he teams up with the Carpool Karaoke guy as your worst nightmare and a female emoji who is actually a princess this whole time WRECKIT RALPH DID IT FIRST to make things right Who wants to play Spot the confusing product placement Basically It is just the worst movie ever made in the century heck it even made Foodfight look like The Lion King Its a good thing I havent seen this movie in theaters But hey That is just my opinion So whatever you do if there is one film or many films you need to watch Please PLEASE avoid this one This movie is just one big Sir Patrick Stewartfest,Negative
The reason this movie is rated so high is because people joking and rating it  I know you people hate this movie but please dont rate it high because it will just make the movie look better then it really is,Negative
Overall I felt that this movie definitely wasnt bad Maybe it was kind of a coy to advertise different mobile apps to young children but I watch this when it first came out and I surprisingly enjoyed it Definitely deserves at least a  Great comedy and plot lines In this show For its purpose an overall great film  ,Negative
OK I went to see this with the intention of finishing it but had to leave early but from what I did see people are just being big babys about how bad the movie is I really enjoyed what I saw maybe not as funny as the trailer was but still good would like to finish it at some point os loved the badass jailbrake she was cool and everyone else seemed great too I liked it not loved it and like I said didnt finish it but I had a nice time from what I got to see,Negative
 In  we will have flying cars  THE EMOJI MOVIEI cant believe that Sony would create such a horrific film My eyes are forever scarred This movie is an atrocity and is just ad WHERE WAS THE  emoji Its unbelievable that people would pay to see a movie like this I already was starting to believe there was no god but now I know there isnt This movie is the opposite of  Dont spend money on this unless you want cancer,Negative
when i saw the movie i thought what a great idea that it has and really enjoyed the movie personally but when i came to IMDb i was expecting really high ratings but reallyi dont know why do people hate this film i found it really entertaining and by the way the whole emoji idea i really think that is awesome by still its one of the most hated movies that i dont really get it,Negative
Oh my gosh this is the worst movie I have ever even heard  All of it was so bloody stupid that I couldnt stop vomiting all over the floor All the kids in the theater were so mad and ever threw there drinks at the screen In my opinion this is the worst movie ever created All jokes in this movie were  unfunny and rubbish  none of the characters had any emotion and it was so boring Both kids and adults with not enjoy,Negative
This movie is garbage Dont watch it I took my little sibling to see this I was forced to and Im very glad with what I saw a horrible movie I wanted this movie to fail simply because of how dumb the idea is and how cringe worthy it is Right now it feels like Christmas for me The movie is so bland and generic and cheesy and illogical seriously they bombed See Sony this is karma for screwing over SpiderMan and all relating characters for the past few years Next time stick with a Popeye movieNow this review Is just my rant about how much I wanted it to fail But if I were to put a REAL review in itd be this This is one of the most clich movies of all time Its like Sony looked at things like Wreck it Ralph and Finding Dory and just straight up copied it But made it worse The characters are bland the story is bland and all the comedy fails STAY AWAY FROM THIS MESSAnd Patrick Stewart what are you doing here in this mess Youre better than this man Cmon Poop Really,Negative
This movie is both boring and rage inducing at the same time I with no exaggeration almost attempted suicide for the fifth time in the past year If you have considered seeing this movie ironically save your money The movie is so awful that it is generally unpleasant to view even ironically If you have a history of suicide I wouldnt risk going to The Emoji Movie as it might trigger an episode If youre a member of the target demographic for this film and are planning on going to see this movie re evaluate your life then promptly proceed to donate whatever money you were going to pay for your tickets to charity and take your family out for dinner at a nice restaurant,Negative
The Emoji Movie is completely garbage useless movie designed to appeal to young children It has terrible dialogue most of the characters are boring and the plot is nonsensical It is one of if not the worst movie I have ever seen Even though it was such a terrible godawful film I enjoyed it Its got a certain charm to it that can only be achieved with a perfect storm of awful Overall the movie fails outright But just because it is bad doesnt mean theres no fun to be had,Negative
If your reading this Im gone now If ever a movie could make you feel any emotion this is it never have I wanted to punt a baby panda for a field goal never have I ever felt that Sony is a sellout when making the movies Like any Adam Sandler movies So if your reading this Im gone now to a far better place so dont cry for me Im already gone,Negative
Its not the best animated film thats true but its far from the worst I took my young daughter to see this and we were both entertained I noticed a lot of people complaining about this being a string of advertisements but most movies are filled with product placements its usually just more subliminal Emoji movie is about the imaginary world inside your phone so they used several widelyused apps throughout the movie to transport us through this phone world Its not entirely unclever It was kind of enjoyable to see some of these familiar apps from a different perspective Dont set your expectations too high its not a Pixar but the animation is good and the story watchable,Negative
I can usually find something good in any animated movie I see but not this one Ugh Im not sure I even want to use a smart phone again,Negative
Its just a movie Its meant for brainless fun not a philosophical or highly intellectual mindsetmeant for    years ages Bible reviews is as funny think this is award world feature movie People This isnt world problem issue hereTheres a heck of a lot of other films they are our awardwinning that is god awful this movie is just fine So sit back relax and enjoy movies Since people more less dont pay for movies and just watch free on the Internet illegally Whats is the point of these reviews youre not paying for the movies So relax enjoy the movie and stop complaining youre saving money People dont see the purpose these kinds movies all the care about are comic book super herosIf they are not a super heros people dont careDont expect great stuff if your watch movies on internet stealing without paying,Negative
Want to watch something without having to really pay attention Here you go Storyline is ok not great characters arent very interesting and female characters are fairly sexist But if you just want to have back ground noise it works,Negative
"Other than being an advertising tool and predictable  mediocre story theres no reason to trash it Like the main character aspired to be this is just meh which in no way is the worst movie of any genre or era Film critics are so anticonventional and anti pop culture that theyre hating for hatings sake and then you get those pretentious middleaged people and meta youngsters to follow them
Simply put its a clich comingofage story about a boy who doesnt fit in and cannot meet the societal expectations Being a failure  outcast he manages to befriend a person who accepts him and helps him find a possible solution Eventually he meets a girl whos also not a social norm and helps him embrace who he isThis movie is not hard to understand not repulsive or atrocious and not an abomination on top of that it has somewhat imaginative visual aspects There are many worse movies out there Woody Woodpecker being the most recent one I watched which may have ACTUAL nonsensical story worse dialog really REALLY bad acting or pokemyeyesout special effects This is not worth the  star rating or the  so quit your whining ",Negative
This movie if thats what this horrendous animation was earned a  and absolutely deserved it in every way It made me cringe and waste some perfect money to see this glob of trash If this movie deserves a  then I dive off of a cliff I would never give this a great review not even for all the cash in the world,Negative
Yeah thats about it The animation looks like some effort went into it But other than that it is effectively one of the worst animated movies of all time Heck its one of the worst movies of all time It will be remembered for how bad it is in future years so theres thatBut  year later Sony produced SpiderMan Into the Spiderverse Literally  in just one year Damn Sony pictures animation,Negative
Im only here to stretch the fact that although the movie has a bunch of production flaws including wrong timed lines where pauses were needed predictable story empty characters and all and all a movie thats constantly on the verge of being boring it has its pros tooI felt the animation soundtrack and voices were really good and there was certainly a great deal of talent behind them The movie on its own will likely be amusing to most young children which i hope was the target audience but other than that i dont believe an older teen or adult would find this as enjoyable as the other animations available The movie has been slandered and insulted in many ways and at this point Im referring back to my Summary TitleBad but not the worst,Negative
People that are like The Emoji movie is better then Inside out are brainwashed and should stop supporting movies that copyandpaste original movies like Lego movieSony if your reading this Please stick to being a video game company,Negative
The movie business is over now The emoji movie has made every other movie obsolete I bet that even Scorsese changed the meaning of cinema films after watching this movie We have reached the epitome of cinemaThe emoji movie is  true kino,Negative
I was fortunate enough and by that I mean unfortunate enough to see The Emoji Movie before its official release date It was awful I do not recommend this movie AT ALL Its morals are forced most of the jokes are terrible and its completely clich I didnt expect it to be good and I was right Dont see this movie,Negative
After reading these reviews I came to the conclusion that  of the  reviewers so far did not actually see the movieWhat they actually did was wait for the movies release then they RAN to their computers to write bad reviews about Why They Hate Sony Pictures and Why They Hate The Idea Of The Movie  without having seen it at allSo dont waste your time reading reviews yet Im going to go watch it anyway I dont expect a major blockbuster mega billions hit why should I Do you,Negative
When I first saw the trailer in May I instantly knew the creation of this garbage was a mistake Now I know I was correct The characters are bland the story is clich and the villain is basically like every other clich villain The entire movie just felt like a Wreck It Ralph rip off with emojis instead of popular video game characters The jokes were not funny at all and there was WAY to much toilet humor in this that even a  year old kid who likes toilet humor would be annoyed by it They listed this movie as comedy even though literally nobody laughed in the theater I was watching it in not even some kids Parents spare your children from wasting  minutes of their life and go do something else with that time This movie deserves to become a box office bomb and is not worth watching,Negative
It was a cute quirky movie Most definitely not the worst movie out there but definitely a kids movie My daughter and I watched it and she laughed the whole time,Negative
Oh boy what do i even sayi knew this movie would be like every other movie but my god i didnt think it would be so bad from immature jokes to just plain aggravation this movie is everything bad that it could have possibly been If you are somebody who likes animation but doesnt care about Story Character Entertaining and pretty much anything else than this movie is for you Overall this movie is bad and should have never been created,Negative
Seriously this movie is one of my favourite movie of all time go watch it,Negative
I finally watched this solely because of the bad reviews and because its on Netflix and I dont understand whats so bad about itIt wasnt a great movie but really wasnt that bad It had an actual plot a decent enough script and there was character growth Id rank it significantly higher than the  animated disasters Despicable Me  and The Garfield Movieboth which were unwatchable The Emoji Movie had its cringe moments especially when outoftouch Hollywood decided again to play s music for children but overall was an okay movieMy main issue is that they targetted the wrong audience Children arent really texting and there wouldve just been more opportunity if they had made this an adult cartoon Emojis are used a lot on dating apps and texting apps but not so much on Spotify and Just Dance,Negative
What the actual hell This is only gonna be targeted for younger audience This is the worst movie of all time No joking Cringe Cringe Cringe I dont care what anyone thinks This movie is as bad as drinking while driving,Negative
Wow just from seeing the trailers of this thing I instantly want to vomit IMDb should really allow  star and negative star ratings so I can go lower than a  Honestly Sony what were you thinking when choosing this over the Popeye movie We all knew this film would be a failure if you look on Rotten Tomatoes you see it has FREAKING  And I also think this is the reason why North Korea wants to nuke all of America and I dont blame them This movie made me lose all my faith in humanity Whatever you do DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP You could be doing much better things with your life than paying to go see this pile of crap And not to mention this is a rip off of Inside Out,Negative
THS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE ITS GUT WRENCHING I HATE IT NO ONE LIKED IT IT WAS JUST CRAP,Negative
Not good SONY bad story bad design just horrible,Negative
This movie is really bad so please save your money and time and not dont watch this bad movie I honestly dont know how kids like This movie doesnt even diserve  star it should get ,Negative
"Why are there so many  reviews saying
THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER SHUT IT  REVIEWERS But why this was worldwide the worst film ever",Negative
"The day after my friends showed me this movie at their house I considered suing them for reckless assualt of the senses and permanat loss of intelligence
The emoji movie is horrible in every single way Its themes ofemotionI guess make no sense the characters are litteraly are  demetional BY DESIGN the story has no stakes or direction filled to the brim with shameless product placement incredibly cringey unfunny creepy humor and forced writing that had us all yelling at the TV It all goes nowhere yet is still totally predictable What is this garbage
Its not even bad in a good way ie you can laugh at how bad it is Its a zero effort cash grab that proves holleywood can spit in our faces laugh take our money and suffer zero consiquence Stop seeing these types of movies even ironically Everyone who worked on this should be embarresed and ashamed of themselves",Negative
I find it surprising that this movie has such a low rating if you actually sit down and take it for what it is its a great kids movie Its funny its bright it has a message What more do you want My  year old amd my  year old like it,Negative
I saw the movie  years ago and it was much better than the reviews I dont know why people were upset about it I will excuse them if the movies at that time were very bad and they were waiting for something great or if they were very great and they were disappointed in it although it is not something you expect a lot for A good movie for children above  Years I watched it when I was  and it was fun for me A minute ago i saw the trailer and it came out even better than what I expected when I wrote the first letter,Negative
"Story

Dont Even Bother Watching This Garbage Watch Chicken Run Or Jimmy Neutron,Negative
It was so bad even Twilight was a better love story The jokes werent good The story doesnt make sense And the characters actions were too predictable most of them taking stereotypical clich roles Waste of time and money The Hotel Transylvania short was  better than the movie itself,Negative
The crappy trailers sum of this garbage piece of crap movie Dont watch it Dont Waste your hard earned money The freaking BOSS BABY was more entertaining than this garbage The characters are one dimensional There is zero depth to any of messages the movie is shoving in your face This turned out exactly what you would expect of a movie about Emojis Absolute Cancer,Negative
While the idea of an emoji movie is pretty silly the introduction with the introduction of the characters is still interesting Associating a lot of images with something that is nothing more than a series of jokes requires a certain intelligence and ingenuity A emoji with greater capacity than the rest must face the challenge of discovering himself while joining other emojis that have certain interests Finally an evil corporation that directs the destiny of emojis is challenged to put control of the situation lest something finally get out of control There are references to multiple applications and programs which would charm someone born in this century There are a couple of great moments dancing is one of them and the movie whether the perfectionists like it or not isnt that bad,Negative
Guys do not follow the other reviewer just watch your self the movie and decide it I watched it today and well it was worth watching if I may told you that it was like a Wreck It Ralph movie the difference is that Wreck movie based on the inner world of games and these emoji movie it was based on Chatting Apps where we find ourselves many characters to send to communicate with others without wasting on writing well this is all I have to saydont ignore it watch and enjoy Thanks guys,Negative
I would rather drink  liters of spoiled milk instead of watching this movie again,Negative
I can summarize the film in only one phrase The worst movie that I ever saw in a cinema,Negative
Sony stick to phones and video games I cant help but feel like this is to sabotage Apple with a terrible movie Sony made  good movies Spider Man  and  and Spider Man homecoming This one is the worst one Even illumination animation is better because though the dont make the best movies you can somewhat know what they are just by looking at them Sonys single digit IQ doesnt allow them to do this so make a movie where the characters are emotions At least inside out does things to make them more complex than Hes happy make him a happy emoji Even Foodfight the terrible movie has characters creative ideas No animated movie is worse than this and this definitely made Steve Jobs roll over in his grave Dont see this movie unless you get to see it for free,Negative
This is just Wreck it Ralph in emoji form It is basically Inside Out in a meme trash stack of Emojis Put those in a blender and you get this trash It is extremely clich if you say something is going to happen chances are it will happen That is how predictable this movie is Its just a cash grab Its not those so bad it good movies Just DONT WATCH THIS,Negative
So lots of people are gonna say how bad this movie But if a great amount of people said this movie was good that other people would hop on board the band wagonBut I actually liked this movie it was enjoyable,Negative
Honestly I cant see how this concept of the movie was even funded Horrible script horrible storyline horribly produced The animation wasnt bad but its hard to make bad animation with CGI Really I cannot remember a more horrific piece of moviemaking in the short history of moving pictures,Negative
Ok people are gonna not like me for this but I kinda like this movie The movie is not like the worst thing ever compare to other terrible movies like Norm Of The North or Where The Dead Go To Die A  isnt really the rating this movie deserves,Negative
"Come on people why is everybody so harsh This may not be KungFu Panda or The Incredibles but it sure isnt a three star animated movie 
Yes the animation is emoji average style but then again it kind of adds to the feeling of the movie 
Pros  short and fast paced not a minute dragged quite original concept of the phone world has the expected friendsfamily values you expect from a teenage oriented movie AND youll have a constant smile on your face
Cons  may be a bit predictable yet not boring some parts sound like a commercial indeed and aimed at teenagers pro or con depending on your age
Overall an amusing movie well worth your time Great for some afternoon relaxing time",Negative
"A lot of people here keep saying that it must be a good movie since it got a lot of money on the box office Thats not true Most of the people that went to see this movie in the theatre only watched it to see how bad it was gonna be And boy it was 
This movie is a piece of trash and deserves every single piece of criticism coming its way This movie is a huge disgrace to what animation stands for 
If you want to watch it dont give them money Watch it online for free You wont feel that guilty when its done",Negative
"Animation supported by only mindless zombie feministsIgnorant
Dont watch Your time is not CHEAP",Negative
Hey dont take my word for it it Its currently  stars on imdb The masses have spoken,Negative
Not even a single second of entertainment in the movieThe worst movie I have ever watched Who is the Dump ass behind this ideaNot even good for kids since it have technical terms which is tough for them to understand Using shabby words is also not good for kidsThe animation at its worst as if we were watching s movies on a old television,Negative
myself n my parents got out of the theater in just about  Mins We struggled hard to see for first  Mins as well Since we paid for the movie  we candidly sat for  Mins Nothing interesting Bad jokes bad screenplay confusing emoji and particularly the initial scene of the movie from hotel Transylvania was damn horrible and bad,Negative
This was the worst movie Ive seen in my whole pathetic life Me and my good friend went to see it with high expectations We were disappointed The whole movie was filled with Jailbreak telling how girls are always put behind men DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS Hopefully this movie gets taken down It was a huge waste of my time,Negative
We heard how bad this movie was online but my  year old son was chomping at the bit to see this We finally saw it when it came to Netflix This was a very cute movie Wasnt completely sure what it was about going in but this a much more enjoyable movie than what I was lead to believe Yeah the plots is a bit predictable and borrows heavily from other kids CGI movies like Wreck it Ralph and other kids fare It has its moments and had me chuckling from time to time with its somewhat dry humor which is my kind of humor All the product placement didnt bother me which is what I think a lot of people really dont like but Im fine with it since it tends to bring us closer with the real world Its not a great movie but its cute family movie overall Even my teen daughter even got into it after hearing how bad it was and liked it Never judge a movie by its  star reviews,Negative
After seeing this movie I think that Ive lost about  IQ points This film should be erased from the planet This film was more disturbing than every single horror movie Ive seen in my life put together This was a waste of my time energy money and brain cells This movie was a piece of poop emoji here  Stay away if you value having hope in humanity,Negative
Bad lieke really bad sad emoji watch with bro walsts drunk and still didnt enjoy Bad meh at best Wablaba dub dub its still bad We need more but like this movie theres is nothing to say that is good Bad Really bad  no good time if  was a possible i would give  Bad bad,Negative
You cant blame people behind animations animations are great you cant blame voice characters but you can and should blame the worst screenplay ever This is horrible I have no idea can emoji movie be filmed in a different way but I know for a fact they have found and chose the worst way possible The movie is not funny or maybe it is for babies from  years old to  years old any older kids will vomit watching this This movie should be as an example for Film students how to not make a movie I cant think of any reason why they made this movie but yeah maybe thats why they made this movie to show students how to make worst movies ever Any Oscars for worst movie ever,Negative
You know a movies horrible if viewing it makes you reevaluate your life I was tempted to run a psychological evaluation immediately after deciding to watch Normally when you take a bathroom break you would want to go back as soon as possible This was NOT the case In fact youd gladly take as much time as possible away from the theater just to escape the soulcrushing horror that is the Emoji MovieThe audio and visuals that this film emits radiates worse than than that of the  Chernobyl Disaster Longlasting side effects include mental breakdowns night terrors and clinical depression Overall this movie is not for the faint of heart Watch with caution,Negative
Let it first be known that for every movie that has ever existed I have never wrote a review for any one of them on this website Up until now that is Im sure youve read the other reviews on this website so I feel theres not much else to be said But since this movie was so bad so terrible so fundamentally flawed that it offended me to the very core of my soul and has left an irremovable blotch upon it I felt obligated to give this movie the worse possible rating I could on the first movierating website that I could find I awoke this morning screaming from nightmares frantic to help the cause in making this movie the most infamous in all the four corners of the omniverse due to the great injustice to the sense that this abomination has scarred me with I will say this once and I will say this nowDONT WATCH THE EMOJI MOVIE,Negative
My god what has Hollywood done How did this idea even get the go ahead to be made Timeeffort and way to much money was used for this movie Dont waste your money on this Dont even watch it as a joke This movie is Sonys terrible reboot of a Disney classic Wreck it Ralph Also Hollywood stopped reviews for this movie a day before the release so that way more people can watch it giving them more money thus giving directors ideas that they should make a fruit ninja movie Conclusion Put a bullet in my head Just shoot me please,Negative
Like the movies main character the whole story line was meh and left me and my entire family feeling like we wasted our time and money Its hard to imagine a movie this bad coming out at this point of time I can see how this would be OK if a group of college students made it but this is by Sony Pictures I hold those guys to higher standards and they failed us They failed us so bad they should refund me my money,Negative
The emoji movie is amazing but youre all just bullies It teaches children love and compassion and that you can be a princess and a rebel at the same time This movie should go on to make  sequels because this is what the children of this world need emojimovieforever,Negative
"I dont understand why the score is so low Yes its not the movie of the century and yes theres advertising in it but the animation is good and the main character is likable The plot is pretty straight forward in the emoji world every emoji have to keep his one face on at all times but one emoji just can do it and he goes on a quest to fix himself so he can be like everybody else
I think it is mostly for kids but I dont see a reason why the whole family couldnt watch it together
I guess if youre looking for something extraordinary or super clever then its probably not for you but if you just want to watch a fun animated movie with your kids theres no reason not to enjoy it",Negative
This movie is clearly a kids movie Only kids ages  would enjoy it I went to see this movie as a meme because of the significantly low ratings its getting Suffice it to say its the first time I physically cringed at a movie however I do not think it deserves such low ratings as its clearly not intended to be watched by people who have developed a rational opinion on film and media,Negative
This movie was as expected Bad If done differently they had a chance of making this an enjoyable movie But they only made this for money So they didnt care weather it was good or not The plot of the film is cliche and the characters themselves are too It deserves the hate it got I would never watch this again in my free time,Negative
"I recommend watching this movie only if you have too much grey matter and want to fry some of it off I could hear my brains cells dying during the movie a feeling I havent had since Sex and the City  
This movie is dumber than Sex and the City  that says it all",Negative
I only gave it a  star because animation is decent,Negative
While this is the movie of the year to hate ignore them there is no rationale reason to hate on this I have seen my share of sub star films and this is not one of themI watched it with my children age range  and they all enjoyed it It has an appropriately positive message for children It keeps a good pace It held the attention of my four year old for the entire length and that alone makes it worth it,Negative
Not sure why there are so many haters for this film Its great And its funny I love watching it especially with my kids Great message,Negative
I really did like the film but there were times where it was a bit elongated Some people might not be able to relate but when your job revolves around social media you kinda get a better connection with the characters,Negative
This movie is simply amazing I loved every part of it Especially the poop jokesJust kidding The whole movie is a great big pile of Patrick Stewart When I wasnt cringing     Oh wait I cringed through the entire movie I mean the plot revolves around meh That is very risky and they blew it Do not watch this movie Not in the theaters not on redbox not even on Netflix where I saw it It wastes time money or both,Negative
"This film is a disgrace to mankind
This film is a disgrace to god
This film is the reason why we will never have world peace
ENOUGH SAID",Negative
This movie can only be described by emojis ,Negative
In this loving story about a young face forced to assimilate into face society learns that loving yourself is more important even if that means everyone wants you dead And they only stop wanting you dead when you do something nice for them Good Moral Great Movie Ill show it to my  children I give it  poop emojis out ,Negative
Honestly this movie is probably the worst Ive ever seen The whole idea is creative and couldve been such an amazing movie but it was lacking a lot of things like the plot and dialogue The visuals characters and setting was terrific It was visually appealing and all the apps and emojis were very imaginative and well done but the dialogue was cringe and the plot was confusing A lot of it didnt make sense and the good parts of the movie sadly dont make up for the bad I dont think this is a suitable movie for young kids as it involves social media and a lot of other things that only teens would understand but it is a pretty lame movie for older kids and adults Dont waste your time and money on it,Negative
If you want to see an amazing crimedrama The Emoji Movie is for you It contains a dazzling story a insanely beautiful musical score and well developed characters Id reccomend this movie if you like The Godfather and its sequels Though when you compare the Godfather and Emoji Movie the God Father almost seems like a shameless rip off yet it came first I would show it to my kids if I had some,Negative
And yes I saw itwell kind of Half of it at least This could very well be the worst movie of  It is a movie that only exists due to being in a state of obvious parody It possesses no merit of its own its highly chichd and it lacks any kind of originalityThe flaws of this movie are so incredibly abundant that it would take forever to jot them all down Among the first that come to mind the bad apple is obvious from the start It feels political just look at the emojis confirmed to their communistlike society There is no emotional connection to any character whatsoeveronly whimsical spikes of interest here and there The script is bland and at times cringy There is no emotional connection BETWEEN the characters this is a problem because emojis representahhememotions and to top it off it feels secondhand in a very sour wayThis movie is a BOMB as far as quality but I think a  will suffice due to the fun I had laughing at it It really makes you wonder how stinkers like this makes it past the drawing board,Negative
The more I think about this unoriginal garbagethe worse it gets The humor is about as entertaining as watching cement drythe characters are  dimensional and annoyingand the plot is from the STONE AGEThe target audience is kids such as myself but I dont see how even the youngest of the young could enjoy this pottygross out humor infested rat nest Not worth anythinglet alone your money Go buy a Pixar film and have actual JOY in watching it,Negative
the emoji movie is a piece of poop emoji i do not like i went to take my children the amount of time they said the word poop surprised me i have young children and they cannot be hearing this type of poop the amount of poop jokes is off the charts one time they even say were number  instead of number  this absolutely disgusts me do not watch this if your want to keep your children from doing drugs smoking and browsing the Internet this movie turns innocent children into homosexuals how dare you Sony i am a single mother of  and have a very high belief of Jesus this movie goes against all of my and my childrens beliefs please understand that this movie is not for anyone except for adults and should be rated AC for adult content Jesus is my life and soul and i cannot believe that this movie even exists under Gods rule the emoji movie is a crime against humanity and only Jesus can save us now if you wish not to die better get on your knees and start praying,Negative
The main character is not interesting the story is not interesting the entire movie is not interesting its just a cashgrab The only people who like this movie are uneducated toddlers who dont know what a good movie is And just like what the title says I will NEVER recover from the utter garbage that is The Emoji Movie its so bad that I didnt even watch the full movie its that bad I never thought a movie could be this bad I started this movie thinking its not THAT bad but it is just horrible I will never emotionally recover nothing about this movie is good an any one I watched part of this nightmare so you dont have to I sacrificed my faith in humanity so nobody has to watch this movie,Negative
Its not as bad as everyone was saying it was Its not like the kind of movie that you want to see again and again but I would recommend getting it from Redbox There are only a few funny jokes and the story can easily be lost Also some of the characters personalities are pretty bland but still a good film to watch once,Negative
I would say that The Emoji Movie has got to be one of the worst movies from  along with Bob The Builder Mega Machines The Movie i cant believe I used to like this movie since august th  but then i started to hate it i would prefer to watch Cars  and Coco better than this movie and it even ripped off Wreck It Ralph and Inside Out which are also better and there was also going to be a Popeye movie but they cancelled it and replaced it with The Emoji Movie that was the most stupidest idea i have ever heard,Negative
I absolutely love this movie I watch it on Netflix every day before I go to bed to have sweet dreams about all the characters Such an advanced and compelling story my mom loved this movie and bought me a whole bunch of merchandise Ive made so much fanart for this movie and the sick dance moves I got from the just dance scene When me and my fam go clubbing we got our sick Emoji Pop dance moves to flex on other people in da club This movie has made my life so much better Ill always have a crush on Gene The Emoji Thank you Sony I love you  ,Negative
Terrible This is an instant money grab Some people dont understand how bad this movie really is Im only writing this review because I want to ensure that you know this movie is garbage,Negative
What did I just watch Exaggerated advertising with no plot at all Bad characters and story One of the worst films Ive ever seen with one of the dumbest plots Do not watch it absolutely not recommended,Negative
Terrible plot unfunny and James CordenNeed I say moreWell according to IMDB I do A minimum of  characters in factSo finally let me recommend that you avoid it Having said that my children have watched it twice I have no idea why,Negative
This movie had everything wrong The story was awful the characters were awful and the concept completely is stupid The movie shouldnt exist and the film felt like it led to nowhere The ending was also unsatisfying The jokes were corny and the character development leads to nowhere This film is a monstrosity and can possibly be considered as the worst film in cinema history The story was very unoriginal and the main villain had literally zero good motives become a villain in the first place The plottwist was awful as it led to nowhere And there were some characters I wish I never met in my life,Negative
I dont understand why everyone hates it so much I just took it for what it was It was a cute little story I think people were expecting like Sausage Party which I couldnt even finish watching but I digress I could watch this movie over again It was kind of funny too,Negative
"The Emoji Movie is a worthless movie unlike with movies that are probably worse such as Doogal I gained nothing from this As bad as Doogal was it is a movie that is fun to make fun of I gained nothing from this film The hand is also voiced by James Corden
I take it back change the  to a ",Negative
Nothing much too say Its just that dumb and stupid,Negative
The Emoji Movie is full a disgusted garbageand even worse filmthat you will never see thisThe Emoji Movie was features T J Miller and alsoit copies from The Lego MovieWreck it Ralph Toy Story and even Inside Out Never see this movie at allAnd also it was going to be Popeye movie by Sony but it cancelled and it replacing with The Emoji Movie which its a stupid idea to replacing with a Popeye movie with this garbage And it has one scene where it put Candy Crush in this movie How even know about they put in the Candy Crush in this movie Even though I like Candy CrushEmojis EverywhereAnd what is this about itI used to like this movie but now I dont I like it since July  and I started to hate it on  Thank goodness it got sold out,Negative
I was very depressed and sad before watching this I felt there was nothing to live for I even felt like committing suicideBut I watched this film once Then twice Then a third And a fourth Something clicked with me It was an epiphany I felt so much different So I stayed up for two whole days while lying in my bed I fasted to focus on my thoughts Now thanks to this film Ive decided to kill myself,Negative

People tend to forget that this is a kids movie If my son likes it am happy,Negative
It was boring uninspired predictable and was a  advertisement for other companies and brands such as Just Dance Candy Crush and essentially Apple itself I was also excited for the Popeye movie and i was disappointed that it was canned for this garbageThis is what youth entertainment has become,Negative
I dont know where to start with this except that  The Emoji Movie by Sony pictures is probably one of the most beautiful inspirational movies of its time The animation is so fantastic so clean and so fluid it surpasses any Pixar movie The plot and story is written marvelously the express and work gone into this movie is amazing There is so much emotion that it brought tears to my eyes I have never in my life watched a movie so perfect There is no other movie that can challenge it,Negative
This wasnt the best kids movie Ive ever seen but it was entertaining and funny for the kids and adults alike Ive given it  stars wouldve been  but IMDB doesnt go halves Worth a watch if you need something easy ,Negative
I was recently diagnosed with cancer and watching this movie made it worse I went from stage  all the way to stage  They brought me out of the theater on a gurney along with six orphaned children who tried killing themselves after realizing theyd rather watch their parents die again then watch this filmed abortion My doctor says I dont have long to live Im currently awaiting results,Negative
Akiko Glitter Christina Aguilera Flamenca Sofia Vergara are the only good things in this movie it looks great but that is it no laughs bad script not much I can say Not even kids will like this or anyone who is not into tech or is into tech will find it offensive I saw this to kill some time and just to see Akiko Glitter,Negative
an hour and a half boring fest is the emoji movie I was so board of this disaster of a flick that I saw it in a drive in just wanting to see spider man homecoming which was up next the story starts with gene the what the heck kind of an emoji he is narrating about their world inside a phone I was surprised that the poop emoji wasnt a main character and Im glad he wasnt the jokes are god awful and the characters are terrible but the animation was cool the boy whos phone the emoji lives in is a god awful character he is the actor who plays him us someone who I wouldnt want to be in my movie The emoji movie is the  most hates movie in the whole wide world and is recommended for little kids TERRIBLE MOVIE,Negative
this day and age the age of cellular technology is taking over the lives of the younger generation making them more incompetent in the real world any child with a smartphone today would say that they would rather lose a lim than go a day without their smartphone and how can people refrain children from constant use of their smartphone lets make a movie pretty much encouraging them to use their moile phones with the constant use of these emoji while we make a ton of money on the side why because f the younger generation and there future actions wont affect me and my millions cheers,Negative
I had very low expectations about this movie due to its extremely low rating but its actually not so bad Ive seen a lot of worse animated pictures and Im clueless about why the rating is so low Im also unsure however why there are so many user reviews rating it  Its an average childrens animated movie which adults can also vaguely enjoy,Negative
This movie is a sad defecation on Sony Pictures It is not just a sad defecation it is a cashgrabbing dump on modern society The Popeye Movie idea was cleverly put up with great wordplay But this copypaste thing that copies WreckIt Ralph and Lego Movie does not deserve to be reviewed but I had to reluctantly do so Gene is a meh emoji who does not have a filter and he would make the wrong face Gene  Emmet One scene references WreckIt Ralph Hi is the worst comic relief Ive ever seen Scrappy Doo PFFT What does he have against the Hi Emoji Jailbreak is Wyldstyle and Smiley is Candy King or Lord Business This film was so predictable and rotten that it got a  on IMDb This overtakes Adam Sandlers Jack and Jill as the rd worst movie in my Worst Movies List On the plus side The voice acting and animation is well done but did they really have to make this bad,Negative
I seriously do not understand all of these reviews that are giving this movie such a low rating Im not a kid nor do I have children of my own Im yrs old and usually dont watch animated films but I love this movie This movie is truly great for all ages As far as emojis go they nailed it with how technology is today This is one of those movies that just puts you in a positive fun mood every time you watch it If your looking for a movie that is fun and cute  then I highly recommend Watch a scary movie and then double feature this afterwards so you have sweet dreams and its perfect ,Negative
The Emoji Movie  by Tony Leondis while often criticized holds a special place for many including my daughters who genuinely enjoyed it Its a vibrant fastpaced adventure that brings the digital world to life with colorful animation and a positive message about embracing your true self even if youre a meh emoji The films energy and simple humor resonated well providing a fun and engaging experience for younger audiences Its a lighthearted escape that proves entertainment can sometimes be found in the most unexpected places,Negative
I cant believe Sony cancelled one of the most classic cartoons of all time just for this EMOJIS Popeye is considered a classic among kids and adults alike but no instead we got a ripoff of WreckIt Ralph Lego Movie and Inside Out combined  superior movies WreckIt Ralph being my favorite Unoriginal concept and clichdannoying not as annoying as the minions from the Despicable Me series characters sums up the movies ratingreviews If you want to find a better movie I recommend either the  movies Ive mentioned or the new  releases Otherwise do not take anyone here or ask them to go to this movie,Negative
Emojijooviee McCormick Meiji worst and poor movie the girl bow nor er em OK Ive this movies trailer and the trailers had a ton of dislikes and idea why this got a bad review and the YouTube trailer thumbnails make me alive here again they save peoples lives from the cringe and all the movies like zootopia and moana are way better than this poop,Negative
Please do not make the mistake of watching this movie Odds are the creators think the target crowd is either small children or people who like movies who are so bad theyre good which means the movie is probably made  on purpose so people will watch it due to curiosity And masochism,Negative
"MORE REVIEWS AT booksequalhappinessblogspotcomREVIEW I really dont know why many people hated this movie I honestly enjoyed it though maybe because I wasnt at the mood to over think stuff when I watched it It was just a simple movie with a simple story and I found it quite fun I really liked the animation I found it bright and entertaining I also loved highfive so I enjoyed his humor even if it was cornySHOULD YOU WATCH IT If you want something bright and very light yes
WOULD I WATCH IT AGAIN Probably not Unless I want to show it to someone else",Negative
Made me realize suicide is not an option but an answer The movie represents everything that i hate about the cinematographic industry the reused jokes the obvious plot the obvious marketing all pull together into a big pile of sht its not only bad its evil its a cringe machine on purpose just for the sake of moneyif you watch this movie just put a bullet to your head pain will go away my friend,Negative
Rated  stars a fabulous movie full of fun tension good story  you can actually feel for the emojis as the story progresses Excellent Characterization Scripting and superb Animation This is a fun watch and can be watched repeatedly,Negative
This movie does not deserve the rank it has The only real reason its so low is because a few Youtubers thought it would be funny to tell their fans to go rate this movie low as they could Here is what I think first off its a kids movie so yes the plot wasnt made to be complex its made for kids The only reason I took a star or two off is because its not the first movie to do this This is a mesh of Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out both have decent ratings if you have kids its worth at least watching,Negative
Its literally a movie about Emojis EMOJIS What is the point of it Its a wreck it Ralph ripoff and doesnt deserve to even be in the same sentence as Dunkirk Dont see this movie Dont give it money Kill it Bury it Go see Dunkirk or Baby Driver Also apparently they might get enough money for a sequel Lets not have that Please Those are my thoughts Dont see this film if I can even call it that,Negative
This is considered the worst movie of  and the worst animated feature to date This movie maybe fun and colorful thanks to the computer animations but dont be fooled its really bad I feel bad that Sir Patrick Stewart has been wasted in this ridiculous film as he is one of the most respected actors those this not the first in which any acclaimed actor has degraded themselves to be part of any nonsense movie like Al Pacino in Jack and Jack back in  which the worst of allNo words can i describe in this movie but its all completely candyanddigital garbage and Sony is wasting their money on producing this piece of filthy and colorful bloody trash Its so boring absurd and horrendous Recommend to families even children not to watch this insidious piece of garbage for their sake of their morality and their innocenceOne simple word to tear it apart MEH,Negative
Didnt even watch it tbh Watched the trailer and heard reviews tho ,Negative
The storyline is very lazy I dont know who ever okayed this trash,Negative
Definitely not the worst movie I have ever seen in my life although it wasnt the best either The plot is one of the most overused and the jokes subpar but the characters were quite likable and the animation style was colourful and energetic which Sony is known to be like on Hotel Transylvania  Cloudy With A Chance Of MeatballsWould be enjoyed more by younger childrenOverall Id give it a ,Negative
I cant believe how people are giving this such terrible reviews Its a cartoon It was not supposed to be a highly acclaimed film or some great hitIts fun to watch and has a good story line and great visuals Sure besides using emojis the plot may be less unique but it was still a fun watch for day when you have nothing else to do Most people giving this a  star review are being dramatic and overcritical especially given that Ive seen much worse movies in the theaters that ended up with  or  stars on IMBD Also please ignore the star reviews from trolls who are trying to be funnyBottom line Dont expect an instant classic and you will enjoy this Give it a shot,Negative
Ok so looking at the reviews I thought I would give this a try I was a bit confused with the stream of either  and  maybe a bit marmite but NO absolutely NO I have  young children who are  and  and they like everything giggle and laugh at all the silly things in movies but this one they wasnt interested just went off and playedI work shifts for the ambulance service so my time is very limited with my little ones and to have wasted an hour and half actually makes me angry I think Patrick Stewart is a absolute brilliant actor and Im so sad he was wasted on this epically terrible filmThe  views are fake as no normal person in their right mind would give that maybe being really generous Anyway dont say I didnt warn you,Negative
Worst movie of  by far Full of cringy jokes horrible story line why was this movie created,Negative
i dont think i even need to describe this to you no one expected this to be the least bit good its copying the whole idea for a movie from WreckitRalph and is using a concept or genre that is questionable within its existence in the first place Emojis However it could have been something SOMETHING at least more than a complete waste of everyones time but its not theres no effort here theres clearly no soul or dedication here either if there was not only would it not be a rip off WreckitRalph but it flat out wouldnt exist in the first place because no one wanted a movie about emojis you can ask people in the street and theyll either be offended that you even thought people wanted the emoji movie or not know what it is some middle aged men wanted to make bank and thought that since the children these days use Emojis practically everywhere theyd make money from every demographic the only thing i want to know is how much they payed Patrick Stewart to be in this  hour long coma dream,Negative
"My   yr old niece  I came across this movie on Netflix She laid down and watched the whole movie with me  we continuously laughedThis was a very cute movie  one that as a Mom of a toddler I was able to enjoy very much as well 
 Not sure why there are so many negative ratings but glad we came across this one ",Negative
I hate this movie I mean a movie about emojis What the hell were these people thinking First off the plot If you seen the endless spiral of cheesy Be YOURSELF kids movies you seen the plot of this Okay its this an emoji has more than one emotion gee where have Ive seen THIS before and the phone is getting deleted IDK what else the plot is but product placement or ads Second of all the characters Theyre the blandest characters Ive seen all year Gene is the generic guy who is different than the rest who is accepted in the end Hi whos idea of a name is this the comedy relief who is annoying and as hyperactive as a  year on sugar and Jailbreak the hardened chick who is kinda of a feminist that would fit in well with the Tumblr crowd of edgy  somethings Also there are other characters who are completely one dimensional and only used for teh plot andor comedy Finally this movie sucked big time The only positive thing is that most people hate it including children That restored some of my faith in humanity Anyways this is Princess Radar signing out,Negative
This movie was the bestest movie i ever watched and it was very good the charaqtars were very good and it was not a spooky movie so that was veery good to,Negative
I watched this movie cause it got many bad reviews So I thought I should watch it And you know what ITS NOT THAT BADOkay forget about the story look the animation its amazing Btw dont trust critics review too much just watch it on your own And you will know it yourself ,Negative
I only decided to watch this garbage because of its horrible rating Wanted to see what the fuss was all about Aside from the typical heros adventure that has been played out in films over a thousand times this movie in itself is basically one big commercial to sell apple samsung phones and other products to kids This is the end result when you have a generation of kids addicted to smart phones you get bad movies designed purely to promote products and not focus on actual original plot dialogue characters etc Waste of money shouldve never bought that ticket If youre reading this dont buy their merchandise or the tickets to movies like these It only further promotes the production of garbage movies like this one,Negative
Remember all of the animated classics Brilliances and captivating viewing experiences that have entertained us and will continue fascinate generations who will continue to watch these classics long after I and indeed you have left this plane of existence where there will be sequels to all of the following evercontinuing sequels which never get stale Classics like Your Iron Giants Your Cowboy Bebops Your One Hundred and One Dalmatians Your Fists of the North Star Your Fantasias Your Grave of the Fireflies Your Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs And your Neon Genesis EvangelionsWelp Tear em all down Animation is deadI was hoping to have off myself before the release of the meme movie but thankfully for all of humanity and those who care about me it has since fortunately been canceled after the relentless mocking of this piece of infringement of our human rights Its worst sin in my eyes at least is that the Popeye movie which I was pretty excited for the first time I saw it I was overcome with nostalgic memories from when i would watch old s Popeye cartoons and now the Popeye movie wont exist we traded it for the Emoji Movie,Negative
what did I just watch This is the worst animated movie I have ever seen in my life This movie was worse than foodfight and Mars Needs Moms and this was worse than Minions This was even worse than the trailers This movie was worse than I thought it would be The thing that really angers me is that they canceled the Popeye movie for this crap movie Do not go see this in theaters You will waste your money I am saving you and your money All of the jokes were not funny and the whole movie was so stupid,Negative
Be checking it out my fellow millennials This movie is so hashtagRELATABLE All the kids these days are constantly using the machines so the HIP COOL SWAG people at Sony made a AWESOME movie about those devices those kids these days are constantly on In this movie all the kewl kids use the cellular devices to communicate with their peers One young man starts telegramming his crush with these mobile phone hieroglyphics that the youths refer to as emojis Suddenly we all get to learn how that technology really works In my day we had a rotary phone that took  minutes just to dial AND WE LIKED IT But these days the childrens have an entire city called Textopolis in those dang devices Sony seems to really be in touch with the youths of today with all the edgyyy relatable jokes and puns in this movie,Negative
Watched this for the meme and it was so much worse than anticipated It was a slog to get through everything was dreadful apart from the colours and Sir Patrick Stewart,Negative
The less said about this vile  minute ad the better This manipulative excuse for a movie deserves a  star in the hope that if its universally panned the studios wont be tempted to produce more of this vomitIve noticed several  star reviews for this movie Do not take any notice These people are either trolls or sad obvious shills They say alcohol consumption kills brain cells it has nothing on this garbage,Negative
"There are a lot of  and  out there  most of them are  anyway I read the critics the meta one and tried to grasp anything but i couldntand i am still confused why its been rated so lawNot the best movie for surenot the best dialogue or even story could have been better if they hired real geeks in writing processBut still its worth watching for the slightly fun you will get  for to see how the going to connect the dots and where it will lead eventuallyI dont think this is spolier as it is mentioned in Trailerbut an emoji with multi character Its good one By the end of the movie i wished there were some cooperation in some kind to make the emojis on the phone animated  better yet to have that surprising emoji
In conclusion Its not the best if you are looking for one but still deserve a chance and worth to watch so thumbs up ",Negative
I watched this ironically cause Ithought it will be bad but no I was wrongit was absolutely  So if you are going to see this pathetic excuse of a film give quadruple the amount of money that you spent on this film to charity to wash away your sinsso go see at your own risk and if you liked it youre lying,Negative
It was what it is a cute movie about emojis in a phonestop tring to make it gone with the wind,Negative
This is a realy good film for to watch with your family I wuldnt say this movie was bad I WULD SAY THAT ITS REALY GOOD,Negative
The emoji movie is a generic uninspired film packed with predictable and uninspired jokes You can also expect an unhealthy dosage of terrible social commentary in this action packed memeUs humans made a lot of mistakes started wars mistreated other creatures and made the emoji movie God is probably testing out the wight of different rocks to throw at our planet at this point I hope it was worth the pay check sir Patrick Stewart needed more poop jokes,Negative
Maybe  stars at best But we got a bunch of liars out here giving bs reviews so now I gotta give it  star,Negative
The emoji movie is a very rare type of movies that are so bad you can watch them twice and still have a good laugh If i could vote  I would The movie itself is meh Actually its worst as meh I dont even know why Sony made one in the first place This movie is worse than world war  and the room and thats a hard act to follow If they decide to make an emoji movie  then I quit The idea and movie itself is meh actually its worse than meh its abysmal,Negative
I am a teenager and Im disgusted The movie fails to fit teen demographic I did not like the jokes they are too corny and bad As a movie reviewer I tell the truth about the movie I thought that the Emoji Movie was complete crap The only thing I liked was the animation I thought the animation team did great The dialogue was very forced for genes parents The lesson of the story is like Wreck it Ralphs Lesson You can be yourself or something like that Overall please dont watch this movie,Negative
I thought the idea about a movie with emojis as characters was pretty cool Then I watched the trailer for this movie It is the most boring trailer I have ever seen in my entire life What the trailer showed didnt appeal to me at allThanks to the trailer I already dont want to see this movie Save money and more than an hour of your lives by not booking a seat for this movie,Negative
A kids movie especially kids who love watching youtube and who like play on a tablet or phone will loves this movie My eight year old son loves this movie Dont take the negative reviews from adults seriously,Negative
My  year old boy liked the film as there are bright animations and he doesnt understand storylines yet I usually love kids films but this is poor Tried to be too clever but didnt deliver on comedy or plot I dont understand how anyone would give this film  Must be paid,Negative
My son and I watch this almost daily He loves it and I love it,Negative
The exact same anime movie we have seen time and again character shunned for being different from the masses then learns to embrace his uniqueness Dont fool yourself If you think this movie is bad then realize almost ALL animated movies from the past  yrs are equally cliched and bad,Negative
The worst movie I ever seen no good parts it should be it has horrible acting and plot the love story is the worst I ever seen the villain is the worst charecter the jokes or even worse,Negative
The movie might have a few creative ideas of its own and some really good animation but the plot is derivative of better animated movies the comedy in nothing but a neverending compilation of unfunny puns and product placement is everywhere you look The movie nobody asked for and nobody wanted,Negative
This is an insult to my intelligence of electronics and common logic If I have to even read the word Emoji again I am probably going to go throw someones smartphone into the trash This movie is so bad it gave me several brain tumors from trying to process all of the cancer this movie gave This movie had so many product placements it made my brain cry If you like your kids and your selfrespect do not watch this horrible movie You shouldnt even torrent it,Negative
I honestly wanted to sink my head in the sand when this came out Please dont watch this Please dont I envy people who havent watched it yet Here we are right before us will be a generation of cancerous kids whos mentality is succumbed to The Emoji Movie This is a utter monstrosity Please I beg of you to spare yourself THE end is near,Negative
For children very colourful for adults a clever story line ,Negative
Alex is a boy trying to connect with classmate Addie through his phones messaging app Textopolis Inside the phone each app is a world upon itself In Textopolis Gene is an emoji eager to follow his parents footsteps as another Meh He fails in his first attempt and in the ensuing chaos emoji leader Smiler sets bots to erase Gene Hi joins him in escaping into the world of the phone Hi leads them into a pirate app to find hacker Jailbreak to fix GeneThe start is good I like the old emoticons walking into the retirement home Despite the really stupid premise Im still willing to give this a chance hoping for some old Tron magic The start is simply a fake out as the movie deteriorates into nothing I couldnt stand it even with the very short  minutes worth of viewing The poop jokes are fully expected but still insufferable Why would Alex send the Meh emoji in the first place Its all bright colors and meaningless stupidity It may still be enjoyable for really young kids with their first phones They may have fun with this idiocy,Negative
I think its one nice family movie with good animation,Negative
Saw this movie last night and I cannot fathom the negative reviews Because frankly its about as good as say any of these animated movies Its on par with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs or Wreck it RalphSure its by the numbers but newsflash  they ALL AREIt looked great it was funny  enough  and it had just enough charm To clarify it succeeded by ticking all the boxes with the bare minimum but its so similar to movies of its kind I cannot understand why its rated so lowBecause if you liked Bee Movie youre going to like this OK so its not quite as well rounded as Bee Movie or in fact any of the successful animated movies but its certainly not far offUltimately its a silly  minutes  and thats all it was ever supposed to beI was pleasantly surprised,Negative
I didnt believe that this movie was going to be as bad as other reviews said it was I was wrong After watching this movie I had to take a break from life I returned home and laid down on the couch and just stared at the ceiling I couldnt do anything and to be honest I didnt want to I started questioning the reality of this world and the future of animation Its safe to say that I became a hollow shell of my former self after seeing this movie Jitterbug echos in my head every time I close my eyes now thanks to this corporate garbage,Negative
The Emoji Movie Where do I even begin Well this Movie is a ripoff of the surprisingly Successful and Good Lego Movie and it is just a movie to make money off of Look ever since The Lego Movie came out and The Lego Batman Movie came out and those  Movies really surprised me I was thinking maybe this can be good I WAS WRONG I dont have any positives for this Movie except one and that is that people will at least stay up for this Movie and not fall asleep and you will be waiting to get out the theater to tell your friends how bad this Movie is So dont see this Movie at all go see another Movie like SpiderManHomecoming again or Dunkirk something else but this This Movie is bad,Negative
This movie is very much like the Disney Movie Inside Out It involved no creativity whatsoever because of its direct copy already successful movie Inside Out Inside Out was a great movie for Disney Lovers but then this bland remake came out and i personally did not hate it but did not enjoy it It was OK It was funny although the jokes were very dirty Young children will not understand but trust me adults will,Negative
I Love this filmbest movie of all timefunnygreat charactersJolly animation and amazing songs,Negative
"Actually the movie overall tells a nothing teaching story It is basically about an emoji running away from other emojis It doesnt really have a plot twist moral or either characters that I could identify to 
 But if you want a movie to just watch on wait to work I think that this movie is good for this Thats because even if you dont focus on it for a few seconds or even minutes you wont miss many things",Negative
Good cinematics great fps Controls were weird though theres a delay between when I press buttons and when I move Tried to change keybindings but it wasnt in settings It kept crashing and I had to stop playing It has the potential to be a great game if these issues get patched for the official release,Negative
This  is the worst thing i have ever seenThe budget is scaryIt could be as good as the Lego movieBut instead we get the emoji movieSony need as much money as possible in order to get sardines to live on Please Tony Leondis never NEVER make a new film or just make the fidget spinner movieDab the movieThe cold boys and finally just make red bone forever ,Negative
 horror it was so bad that i bled from my eyes Everything became blurred but the terrifying smiles of those emojis They haunt me in my dreams Theyre more than just emojis Theyre demons sent from hell to punish us for our sins After watching the movie I went straight to my room and jumped out of the window I am here typing with a broken leg spinal cord and skullThank you very much for this terrible movie from hell,Negative
The story is an completely sucked out theme that is used like  times already the jokes are just awful and i really needed to skip the last  minutes because i just couldnt watch it anymore This is probably the worst movie of  the scary thing is i wont even be surprised if they top this one in even already  or something What could be worse than this Well they managed to make an movie THIS bad so who knows what they still can root up,Negative
The Emoji Movies concept was DOA but the movie brought in millions of dollars Dont be surprised if Emoji Movie  is announced OOF,Negative
I saw the reviews and decided to watch it to see what was so bad about it bc I was bored It wasnt that bad though I actually enjoyed it It doesnt reach DisneyPixar level with extra details to make the fantasy world more realistic  like Inside Out and Ralph Breaks the Internet and especially doesnt reach the fee emotional impact that DisneyPixar achieves but it was amusing and entertaining A good animated movie that kids would love and I laughed at the jokes,Negative
Please Dont do this to yourself Makes you vomit in your mouth a bit to be honest Lots of people at the theater just straight up walked out and left in the first half hour Im not kidding Spare yourself the pain and dont watch the Emoji movie After we sat through that A man started yelling at the people that worked there that he wanted a refund for his family and said That is not worthy to be called a movie,Negative
James corden is bae and this film is amazing  marry ne hi ,Negative
I dont understand the negative ratings and reviews they just dont seem objective This movie is fun charming original and full of creativity Its enjoyable for both adults and children Many scenes are really cool and original Ignore the bad reviews Sometimes people go against something for no reason and this is one of those cases,Negative
What can I say Except its terrible Me being me decided to just watch the ending on youtube so I wouldnt waste my money on this garbage Yep its bad Dont waste your money on this one Tbh Id rather make love with a cat than spend money on this freak show I mean if you have a son or daughter that wants to see this just take them to see the latest horror movie Trust me its for the best,Negative
Very badly acted  Mediocre score  Badly written characters  Some scenes are just watered out to make the movie longer ands its about an emoji Highly paid actors are just really bad in animated movies so just dont DO IT That is my very short remarks on the emoji movie and how terrible it really was  star,Negative
Pulp Fiction Shawshank get out of here Theres only one movie to watch Its The Emoji Movie This brilliant artwork is a masterclass in every way Never again will I watch any other film but this,Negative
Burning your money for the ticket would be more enjoyable more intelligent and more entertaining than Emoji This movie is totally dull and a waste of time The plot is predictable and poor And it is absolutely not funny There are stupid movies that are at least somehow entertaining This one is just boring nothing else You have been warned I suggest that you save your money and watch something else,Negative
My anus imploded while watching this movie Its was a good movie but my anus implodes Anus gets imploded every time I see a emoji so it may be natural the part of imploded My experience in sending a emoji is now different my anus imploded every time I didnt like it because it did not have a black meh emoji and I fell oppressed,Negative
No one should Ever have the misfortune of watching this movie,Negative
Why are there so many low and negative reviews for this film I do not knowI think it is ridiculous how so many people rate it a one out of ten Like seriously some of you people who left such negative ratings could really not give it any more than one star I think rating this movie  is way too harsh and too poor It sort of says something about yourself if you rate this film only one star it means you just want to be so overly negative This filmmovie is a lot better than I actually like this film I have watched it and I think it is good how emojis were made into a movie which is obviously what this film isI did write this review mostly to say that I really disagree with all of the very low reviews mostly all of the  reviews as I said above,Negative
I still think The Bye Bye Man  is the worse this is on my  spot I have to admit I almost like it but when the movie progress it get worse Bad story some decent voice acting bad script painfully unfunny joke and bad writting This is anothor Wreck It Ralph like this the protagonist doesnt feel like themself until he screw up so the owner decide to delete it because its acting wierd so he find the way to deal with this THERE I describe both movies in the same time I wasted hr and min of my life Im done Im glad I didnt watch it in theaters ,Negative
Its perfectthe most amazing movie I have ever seeni laughed a lot and it made me very happy ,Negative
Easygoing family fun film People are too quick to make assumptions these days Gave it a chance had a laugh along and enjoyed it Also I thought the storyline was great and the animation was also very good The use of apps in my opinion felt clever rather than a money maker We laughed along throughout enjoyed the puns and found the online rating quite harsh The voice of James corden as highfive and Jennifer Coolidge as Mehs mum really quite entertaining We managed to play a drinking game along to this and it was so funny we drank a few bottles of wine and genuinely had a good time Would recommend if you want an easygoing film to put on,Negative
In the move he goes thru this big journey just to become a meh or should i say Unamused face The surprising thing about this movie is that it is exactly how you feel then the movie is over So either the movie is just that bad or they actually planned for that to happen So i really dont know if i should be impressed or not,Negative
Its better than most of the stuff Ive seen I mean the animation is good but it really just ripped off WreckIt Ralph and The Lego Movie,Negative
Its really really really bad it tries too hard to be funny and fails miserably It is most definitely one of the worst animated movies ever madeIncredibly frustrating experienceMustnotwatch,Negative
Who hasnt ever heard of this movie Jezus christ wtfso this is kinda frustrating movie to talk about like Cars  and The Last Jedi yes I know that those  are bad movies but they are both super frustrating this movie Broke box office records for just being A GODDAMN PRODUCT PLACEMENT FOR APPS this is like FoodFight but they improved the visuals and graphics made the voice acting better BUT IS STILL A DULL MOVIE WITH PRODUCT PLACEMENT GOD you know what screw this movie screw the creators of this movie and screw EVERYTHING ABOUT IT I QUIT,Negative
This film is as lit as Grenfell and the Holocaust put together I was gassed about the movies trailer but me and my friends  and  were very disappointed with the end product,Negative
While the idea for the film is clever it doesnt seem to have been executed very well there were some moments that had me smiling but the film will become outdated quickly with its pop music  use of trends as jokes not a potential classic but enough to keep kids entertained,Negative
Boyfriend got eggplant emoji while watching this This is the best movie ever BEST PUNS EVER BRUUUH,Negative
I know all the hate people have said about this and that a movie about emojis wasnt needed and I agree with that but they tried to do something with itI know it has a pretty normal plot but the animation is really good and the voice actors are good tooIf you look past all the product placements and follow the story and characters then it can be entertaining at times,Negative
This movie attempts to be a satire on how modern day generations are constantly using their phones but it fails in every way I gave this a  as apposed to a  or  due to the fact that its a fun movie to rip on with friends But its is still a horrible movie and the worst animated movie of  and arguably the worst movie of that year Its worth your time for  or  viewings but afterwords let your blueray collect dust,Negative
The Emoji Movie is a film that can only be described for me as a kiddieflick meaning it will really entertain the kids and make them love it but for most adults some might find it mediocre enjoyable or just simply annoying In all other words your kids will love it You probably wont,Negative
I think the Candy Crush segment was probably the most insulting I mean they literally explain the rules of the game just so you know how to play when you hopefully download it after the film is overCome on,Negative
"Theres just one word to describe this movie
HORRIBLE
Emoji sucks more than rotten fish",Negative
En meget mrkelig film ikke en man behver se to gange,Negative
This film tells the story of an emoji that is unable to keep its facial expression to the assigned expression He is ostracised by the emojis and he has to find a way to hack the source code so he can have a constant facial expressionThe Emoji Movie is actually not as bad as I thought it would be The plot basically says that it is alright for a social outcast to be himself Along the way the story utilises expressions games and apps in daily life It tries to be as close to real life as possible so that people can easily relate to the film However there are times when it feels like several apps have paid big money to be prominently featured in the story It is an entertaining story albeit brainless and less refined,Negative
Only cool people will get that reference and jackfilms fans,Negative
This review is based on the Spanish version and not the originalA film about the life of emojis may sound too absurdbut somehow the creators of this movie made it work The Emoji movie is surprisingly fun and enjoyable for adults as well Now this is nowhere near being as good as a Pixar animation or something made by Disney but I can honestly say this has a unique quality to it Im sure this will never be a classic or stand the test of time and that is ok See it for what it is and have fun,Negative
This movie is a joke It is basically the lego movie inside out and wreck it Ralph put together It is literally an hour and a half of nothing but advertisement so do not watch it,Negative
This movie made me realize that pigeons are flying lizard people with brain tumors in their stomach and feet on their nostrilsthis movie is horrific dont watch it if you dont want PTSD that can never be cured,Negative
Dissing cheery childrens films can feel a bit like kicking a kitten and we all know how that would go down on social media even in animated form But sadly this while not as irredeemably horribly awful as I was expecting is still pretty rubbish,Negative
The target audience for this movie would be anyone under  Kids enjoyed it but it was just meh for me Basically about the main character not fitting in with the traditional norms just be yourself,Negative
I expected a lot worse than what I saw here and because of that I was able to enjoy a lot of it but nonetheless it is awful The plot is a generic ripoff of a number of animated films and the animation could have been a lot better although it was clear from some scenes that it wasnt the animators but the director who didnt have much idea on what to do There were a lot of moments which could have come out better if someone with a little more creativity worked behind this The worst part is that some kids are gonna like it because they are uninitiated with better films and would grow up thinking this to be a classic with a nostalgia clouding their judgement even when they grow up,Negative
The Emoji Movie is one of the most hated films in modern cinema And boy I can totally see why Im not saying this is the absolute worst movie Ive ever seen oh believe me I have seen WAY WORSE but this is still a horrible animated film The writing is absolutely awful Its like they didnt even TRY to put any sort of effort in the script Its an obvious ripoff of  animated films MUCH better than this film WreckIt Ralph The LEGO Movie and Inside Out The characters are unlikable and very meanspirited while others are just dull and forgettableThe visuals were okay but other than that The Emoji movie is a heap of unoriginality and is just plain awful Do not watch this movie All those little criticisms youve been hearing about this film are correct Avoid at all costs,Negative
Nice direction and animation and superb technology but an adaption of Inside out and inferior to it,Negative
The film was exactly what I expected some of the jokes managed to make me chuckle Most of all I found that I identified most with Genes mother as her attitude mirrored my own throughout the film,Negative
This movie is awesome Besides jacks films I know nobody including my friends who think this movie is good Why People just say the movie is bad without saying anything about the movie that is bad The movie is funny and James Corden does a great job at voicing  I love this movie and highly recommend it ,Negative
Theres nothing I could say that hasnt already been said The only reason I didnt give this movie a  is because the animation is actually good,Negative
I got forced to watch this one I never wanted to there was a small child relation who wanted to see a movie and this was the only one on in theaters when we were out And by gum was it badSo so badBad enough it took me nearly three months just to work up the courage to write a quick review The charactersactors it was downright depressing hearing Sir Patrick Stewart one of the finest actors alive voicing a character named Poop Ugh But generally the characters were awful The female lead I wanted to fling her out a window Shes loathsome The comedic sidekick was only made worse by James Cordens poor performance And Eugene the main lead was just irritating and unappealing The comedy is dreadful The plot frightful The little girl I went with fidgeted the whole time not once did she laugh or smile She seemed bored So dont try and claim kids will like it Kids are too good for this This is an ad A poorly done ad Avoid it you cant even MSTK this thing Abandon all hope ye who view,Negative
Absolutely amazing i have no wrds just sooooooo good,Negative
A true cult classic this movie will stand the test of time mark my words They obviously put their heart and souls into this project and came out with this work of art When he says emojis are the most important form of communication I really felt that This movie is  would see again,Negative
Well not as bad as the ratings and reviews shown here It was pretty enjoying to me I just wished the main conflict was not about how an emoji should be because emoji was just an emoji It has to be smile emoji meh emoji etc and not a multitalented emoji You know like Monster Inc movie where one of the main conflicts was about who could scare kids the most,Negative
Overall I believe the movie creatively summed up the moral of be yourself This is an important lesson and was portrayed throughout This is evident in the trailer so this is not a spoilerI thought it was OK The animation was quite good and there was some relatable and creative moments which I think was the only thing this movie had going for it There was also some cheeky product placement which was very obvious however there were some funny relatable smart phone moments not going into too much detail that did make me chuckle NOT laugh big differenceThis movie is basically your clich animated kids movie it has some humor that is slightly funny a villain and an end goal I predicted the ending within the first  minutes of watching the film I was right There were so many opportunites missed with this film but I am surprised at the  average rating I would have given it a bit more then that Overall I do not recommend this movie and rather suggest you spend your money on one of the better movies out right now cough cough Dunkirk,Negative
"Dont even bother with the good reviews they are just jokes that people made but read the good reviews as if it was opposite day because this movie is AWFUL TERRIBLE UPMOST DISGUSTING HORRIBLEEEE i hate this movie so much but i am not angry at the movie rn im craving bleach because this movie is so shit btw if you want a GOOD sound stupid is actually awesome movie go watch the lego movie one of my favorites of the genre
",Negative
Its not as bad as I expected but its still pretty bad The humor is pretty crappy literally The romance is cringeinducing at best The plot is predictable and the characters boring The only redeeming quality the movie has is that its pretty short I would not watch this movie ever again and I would not recommend this cesspool of a movie to anyone,Negative
This movie is the epitome of cancer Real actual cancer I have never sat in a movie theater before and actually thought I want to kill myself Why does this movie exist Who conceptualized it WHO AUDITIONED FOR IT WHO PITCHED IT TO SONY WHY DID SONY AGREE TO THIS In conclusion this movie makes me want to blow my damn brains out every time I think about it AIDS Pure AIDS,Negative
The worst movie I have seeneven not worse commenting onjust do not waste your precious time on it terrible humor I would say no humor at all  terrible quality though with nowadays technology and possibilities could be much better  after watching the trailer supposed to be cool original and funnybut the trailer in fact says all about the movie so you can end up there,Negative
This was such a great movie I loved every second of it The animation was of high quality and voice acting was sentimental and good Really looking forward to a second part,Negative
The Emoji MovieGrowing up the only emoticon you were allowed to feel was Smiling FaceAs per this animatedadventure Now theres a myriad of symbols to emote your psychosisInside of a teenagers phone lives a multifaceted face emoji Gene TJ Miller that doesnt want to be defined by his meh designation like his parents so he teams up with a HI sign James Corden and a hacker Anna Faris that can help fix his glitch before Gene is deletedBut to repair Gene they must survive Candy Crush Instagram and SpotifyA platform for app and software companies to reach impressionable young minds this commercial masked as a D kids cartoon is corporate brainwashing Intent on creating brand loyalty amongst preschoolers by way of cutesy characters showing this schlock to minors should be deemed child abuse Furthermore who needs emoticons when every human emotion can be articulated by a dick pic Red Light vidiotreviewsblogspotca,Negative
I really wish I could give this movie a zero There are literally no redeemable qualities You cant even argue that the animation was good because by this point its impossible to make it ugly unless you screw up by godly proportions The sad thing is this movie wasnt a failure It made crap loads of money even though everyone hated itPlease stop ironically giving this product good reviews And someone hand me a bottle of cyanide,Negative
Currently sat watching this tripe of a movie and feel my senses are being violated in so many different waysWhats worrying is my  year old daughter is sat watching this drivel and appears to like it How has the movie world succumb to this style of movie I thought we had a lowering of the bar with Angry Birds but nooooooThis generation of children are being poisoned by this anal bleaching of a movieAvoid it  save yourselves its too late for me,Negative
THIS MOVIE WILL MAKE YOU AND YOUR KIDS STUPID Id rather have a buffalo take a diarrhea dump in my ear then watch this movie Id also rather eat the rotten ahole of a roadkill skunk and down it with beer This movie is Fkin AWFUL Every time i see something related to it I want to KILL myself Also The Emoji Movie has a deal with McDonalds McDonalds is SO GULLIBLE,Negative
That was the worst piece of human waste Ive ever seen After watching it I felt like life wasnt worth it and got crippling depression Life is pain I will go kill myself knowing this waste of human energy existsThis is a crap film dont spend money Please Dont WATCH IT,Negative
I wonder why many people think this movie is a flop but i actually like it Pls apreciate the animators,Negative
Okay obviously people feel the need to be utterly sarcastic and ridiculous about tearing this movie down but I didnt think it was that bad Honestly people there are worse movies like Inside Out Chicken Run Angry birds and every recent live action Disney remake Sorry but the live action Beauty and the Beast Aladdin Lion King and the rest are patheticIs The Emoji Movie a cinematic masterpiece No but it has a decent albeit predictable storyline with a positive message about embracing who you are I would definitely choose this over some of the other garbage that passes for childrens movies these days,Negative
All I can say about Sonys worst work of art yet is well meh whats the point of reviewing this We all know how bad it was Lets just keep the hype up for Incredibles ,Negative
This is the worst ever rated movie I ever took to the time to watch and im glad I didThis movie is not bad and it has the classic story line of the hero going on a journey to discover his true worth It does not deserve the  rating The animation is great and all in all it is a well produced movie This movie brings nothing new to the table but if you are looking for a movie to watch with the kids on a Saturday night this is gonna be just fineThe poor rating is simply people getting too personally invested in the idea of using emojis as a universe,Negative
This is a very disturbing development It is time to question the mental faculties of todays producers directors and even actors that are willing to participate in this whatyamacallit Horrible writers coming up with these screenplays These ideas These insults to the human intelligence All I can say is steer clear of this monstrosity and protect your kids from ever having to see this It will cause a huge traumatic experience and will leave them scarred for life And to make things even worse it could cause mutations Kids could be born with a phone attached to their arm instead of a hand,Negative
With that i meen they actually manage to create a movie that was worse then there last bomb the reboot of GhostbustersAt this point i truly think Sony want to destroy themselvesSee a bunch of eather bots or paid reviewers giving this pile of oozing crap  raitingDo nor Believe themFor your mental health sake stay away from this movie at all cost,Negative
This  was total  How on  Is this science fiction The product placement is  It made me  to think that  would watch this  What a  Humanity is  Please  Sony is  In fact Sony can  my  If you go to  This youre   I give this  five  for being the worst idea ever Total ,Negative
Ive been searching around for the movie greats on this website and searched for some of the classics like the Godfather the Shawshank Redemption Shindlers List and Freddy Got Fingered and I came across this beautiful visually stunning masterpiece assuming it will at least get an  and I was appalled to see such a low score on such a masterpiece These primitive neanderthals think they have a sense of art The morals and themes fly straight through there heads while they are scratching their aes for an hour and thirty minutes Marlon Brando would be rolling in his grave to see such an artistic beauty rated a  I thought of Al Pacino who did many classics like Jack and Jill when I saw TJ Millers performance of Gene Screw It I thought of Gene Wilder Just while I thought I was restoring my faith in humanityCheers Bob Marley Writer Actor Director Producer,Negative
This movie was basically a propaganda piece The whole plot characters and story line was just dire and completely unsuitable for young children watching None of my children enjoyed the film which is not surprising At the end you were left with a weird unsatisfied feeling that the film had achieved nothing and that was because the characters had achieved nothingAgain we see the result of basically feminist bs being fed into a film and because they have been rejected and have ultimately failed in their love life they appear to want characters in films they have influence over to do the same thing Some of the dialogue from the female lead character was also deeply unsuitable for children of a young age,Negative
I did my best to convince my  year old that one of the many other options at the cinema would be better to watch  but even Gru and his minions could prevent the horror I was to be consigned to  minutes of brain death whilst Im still a child at heart but so little to smile  let alone laugh at As I now know Hell does exist  there must be a God  As this movie is the work of the Devil  or a clever God who wants to recruit some more to his side ,Negative
If the dinner I just had wasnt bad enough this is the worst waste of producers monies I have ever seen Dont waste your time on this brain cell sucking pile of garbage I love animated movies they make me laugh This not only does not make you laugh  but actually makes you want to watch CNN You may want to see a doctor for medication to prevent you from ever seeing this in your head at a later date,Negative
As others here have said this film is really not a film at all but a movie length advertisement for smart phone apps that corporate America wants you and your children to download after you watch the movie Its just a shameless cynical cash grab Very sickening to say the least Not only that this film steals concepts from much better films such as Inside Out WreckItRalph and The Lego Movie Its that unoriginal and lazy I really feel particular disappointment in Patrick Stewart whom I have enjoyed watching in the Star Trek franchise and the XMen movies but I guess even he is willing to sell his soul to play talking poop if the pay check is right A shame,Negative
After hearing what people said about this movie I didnt have high hopes Im sad that I am just now watching this beautifully animated movie I went into it thinking it would be the worst movie Ive ever seen but after watching it I feel bad for saying that Its funny lighthearted and it takes you on a nice adventure It really inspired me to take a hammer to my head I highly recommend watching this if you havent already,Negative
Consider this people spend thousands on pounds to study animation in order to be able to tell meaningful stories and once they graduate this and films like sausage party are the kind of titles they are offered to work on Films like this are ruining the industry If I could give this film less than  star I would,Negative
I was hoping to see a movie to bring my spirits up i am on the verge of suicide and people told me that this movie might help me brighten so i took it into consideration that this movie just might be good I was wrong about a quarter into the movie i was thinking of just flat out ending it but then when i saw the poop emoji played by actor Patrick Stewart i screamed this movie is fcking cancer how the fck is someone supposed to watch this during this fit i was screaming im going to kill myself i was later arrested for a public disturbance chargeThose who claim this movie was good clearly have a low IQ i however dont i have a  IQ Because i watch Rick and Morty and thus,Negative
When I saw how much hate The Emoji Movie was getting I decided I had to see it for myself to see if it was justified An animated kids film with a sizeable budget couldnt possibly be that bad right Wrong It is every bit as bad as the reviews suggestThis is by far and away the worst animated movie I have ever seen It has literally nothing going for it with everything from the plot to the script and characters being nothing short of dreadful As if the idea itself isnt bad enough they then have the audacity to stuff it full of product placement It angers me to think that people actually went to the cinema to see what is effectively a  minute long advertThe Emoji Movie is just another example of a pitiful Hollywood cash grab jumping on a social trend to make a quick buck It is insulting even to the young children it is supposed to please The worst film of the year by far,Negative
Do not watch this movie watching this movie is a waste of time This movie is bad Why would you make a movie about Emojis Emojis are popular In fact I love them  But you shouldnt make a movie about them What is Sony Animation going to make next The Fidget Spinner Movie The Dab Movie The  AM Movie This movie is bad I cant even think of a better version of the Emoji Movie Rule  of Writing a Plot for a movie Never make a movie about something that you shouldnt make a movie about  How is this movie getting so much money,Negative
Different try and its worth watching it The creativity and emojies are great Few drags but its an excellent idea to bring you the fun behind App in our phone,Negative
It sucked sorry but it was cringe predictable and annoying This wasted so much of my life I really dont know why I watched this in the first place I would say sincerely Clair but NO I hope you all enjoy this movie just as much as I did My apologies to the creators it looked good but it wasnt good overall  Please never make another one like this disappointed,Negative
Terrible Just terrible Im sorry but this movie deserves to be shut down Also all of the reviews that claim the movie is  stars are BOTS I repeat BOTS They all use the word Masterpiece similar grammar personality and a couple of them were somehow the same account name and profile picture Do NOT waste your money on this movie,Negative
This movie is literally everything that is WRONG with the movie industry It perfectly shows the absolutely laughable and desperate state that Hollywood is in right now The dialogue of this product is so poor it honestly feels like they wrote it in an afternoon with little to no thought or creativity put into itI am appalled by the unoriginality of this piece of animated garbage If youre going to watch an animated kids movie with a similar plot that actually has some effort and care and attention put into it then please just watch Inside Out WreckItRalph or the Lego Movie THOSE are good films that are memorable and fun to watch  this isntI beg of you DO NOT go watch this pile of tripe ironically just to see if its any good or not because it is not I absolutely promise you,Negative
This is the best movie ever made Only movie you should ever watch only movie i have ever watched I have no plans to watch any other movie,Negative
sorry for bad English Im from turkeythis movie is like wreck it RalphLego movieinside out had a disabled baby that didnt have a brainif you thought the Lego movie was bad this movie will make you change your mind about the Lego movie at least the Lego movie was a okay idea but the emoji movie is about the emojisobviously that tings that most  year old girls use to much yeah you remember thosei use emojis  times a weekis it just me if it is just me dont like it is normal but still i hear that even someone that he uses emojis very much didnt like itnot someone almost everyone,Negative
If I could give this a zero I would I really dont like this movie it reminds me of school And I dont like school ,Negative
Some low budget bad movies are fun to watch because those are so bad This has nothing like that on it This is purely just waste of time It was unbeblievebly hard to keep watching and keep concentrated These people who rated  must have weird sense of humour to make someone waste their time or paid to do so,Negative
Funny kids movie got plenty of chuckles from me good idea for a movie that was executed well Just as good as any animated movie out there tbh,Negative
At first I didnt think I would like this movie because of all the bad reviews it was getting but I actually enjoyed it It was really cute and I connected with the characters and actually felt sad and happy during the different scenes I think this is a great family movie and is worth taking a chance on,Negative
I dont remember hardly anything from this but I remember it was bad Unfunny,Negative
So this is a hr ad everything is wrong with this movie watch toy story or wreck it ralph instead dont spend your time hereThis is the shortest review I have ever written,Negative
I watched this movie on Netflix to make a reasonable IMDb review and I couldnt stand it so I watched  minutes in Why do yall ask I cant come close to understanding the GOOD reviews for this movie Even a scriptwriter who was messed up in the head and given a major concussion could make a movie script and concept better then this The actors who played in this movie the amazing actors like Sofa Vergara and Jennifer Coolidge were completely wasting their time with this movie They probably did this movie to get more movies on their list no offense to how you major actors work by the way Just dont watch this movie if you are thinking about it I mean Im saving yall a bunch of brain cells and time,Negative
As a kids movie its okay I mean the animations nice and the kiddos will find it funny but as a movie for everyoneThats the problem The story is generic or plagiarizing Wreck it Ralph  the animations average and the characters are either meanspirited or bland The exception is Gene who happens to be the only likable character,Negative
The movie is for KIDS I watched this with my  yearold son and he thought it was fine stop hating on this it wasnt made with older people in mind,Negative
How bad could this movie be was my feeling before watching this And to be honest pretty bad Main idea of the movie seems to be hand jokes name dropping different apps and references to basically any entertainment related things Towards the end I was just trying to find all these references Its like the movie tried to take the plot from wreckit Ralph and Inside out but fails miserably Mix in some forced gender equality and you end up with a pretty bad movie Best parts were cat video poop emoji and few actually funny hand jokes But too much is too much I did watch the whole movie so it wasnt all bad Maybe if it wasnt just about the puns the movie couldve had its moments Now there really werent,Negative
The disgusting thing is that all the smartasses with the sarcastic s probably made the production deceide to do another emoji movie Good job you dips,Negative
I think the ratings on this movie are harsh It is a kids film to be primarily enjoyed by kids not adults and from what I gathered at the busy cinema  it was My  year old certainly enjoyed it And to be honest I didnt think it was that bad either and Ive sat through some unbearable kids movies,Negative
This movie is just garbage My sister  I wanted to watch a movie and this was on our recommended I knew this movie was bad before watching it but decided to give it shot since I was bored and had nothing to watch The idea of the movie was creative and original but the execution was terrible  full of cliches Some scenes were so bad  cringy I had to look away like the part with the Just Dance app and the Emoji Pop dance The only reason I gave it  is because the idea was cool,Negative
This movie is proof that we are doomed as a species,Negative
I know this is supposed to be targeted to kids but was dragged to see this movie This is really what happens when Hollywood cannot come up with new ideas for a movie consider this a throwaway movie The voice acting was not great and there really wasnt a plot to follow Wont be surprised if this becomes like the Rocky movie do poorly and come out on Bluray and DVD after a short amount of time Would not recommend anyone see this movie take your kids to SpiderMan again just avoid this movie,Negative
The emoji movie is the best movie I have ever seen exceptional acting breathtaking cinematography and amazing storytelling This is not just a movie Its an art piece,Negative
In my opinion the Emoji Movie is NOT a movie it does not come even close to a movie I have never been disappointed in my entire life I am full disappointed of what society we live inIn this  hour and  minutes movie there is no comedy everything is predictable there is NOTHING interesting about this catastrophic failureIf you have  hour and  minutes that you can waste please dont waste them on this movie its not worth it you could watch a better movie spend some time with your friends or family probably even play a game like Chess or Backgammon it may be boring but its at least entertaining,Negative
But was too full of Pretzels and Popcorn Spent nearly  taking my family to see this piece of emoji excrement My youngest was crying the middle child was angry and the oldest had a blank look on her face as if all her hopes and dreams had been sucked from her soul by this shameless evil cartoon I beg of you dont go see this and warn as many people as possible to STAY AWAY,Negative
Solid one of ten for tons advertising in kids movie really apps and services only for  copypasted scenes from other movies like Barbie Video Game Hero  witch is Candy Crash scene for ex and also we have here very harmful idea emojis actually replace real human interact between two kids and at movie says it was good clearly NOT bad Maybe creators hate kids and living human communication  I dont know but I know this is not a movie for any kids,Negative
Do you hate yourself Desire to be bored repulsed even by a disgusting embarrassing attempt at a film that Sony barfed out to an unwilling world on July th If so the emoji movie is for you I cannot say enough bad things about the emoji movie It is not a real film provides no entertainment and is not a worthwhile use of your time Anybodys time Sony should apologize for having released this movie and give refunds of  to all who are unfortunate enough to have seen it This movie blights out world and makes it a worse place to live raise a family and conduct a normal life The emoji movie is the worst thing that has even happened to human society Do not go see the emoji movie They do not deserve your money If you do see it you are partly responsible for the downfall of civilization that will be inevitable if this trash is allowed to be considered entertainment of any kind,Negative
Instant classic only boomers wouldnt give  Character are unforgettable and relatable,Negative
I Just Feel This is a Movie that Has Nothing to get Bored about The Story Was Quite Interesting and it turned out to be a great movie For Kids Its Just Awesome For Adults Its a huge break and the interesting one that everyone loves to enjoyA Movie to Bring the Real You For Those Who Urge to find Themselves Who want To find Them,Negative
The Emoji Movie is a boring and unfunny kids movie Its not creative or original The characters are bad the story is bad and the humor is awful The only positive thing I can say about it is the animation Its actually quite nice to look atAll in all its bad I know  is brutal but I did actually think about giving it a  for a majority of this movie however then there were two scenes that just baffled me in how bad they were I would not recommend this to anyone but I think its watchable for very very young kids,Negative
I agree that this film was not good Not because of bad writing animation voice rendered but the timing of the film coming out mattered If this same film was released before Wreck it Ralf The Lego Movie Pixels Inside Out then people might have liked it But now it is like Sony desperately wanted their version of toys andor games related film so they made it Thats how it looks like Despite all the criticism the film minted good sum So it is not a box office flop only devalued honestly by those who saw itThose titles I mentioned and this story has the same storyline Basically thats very common platform where  per cent of the films borrow from The scenes looked very ordinary like theres nothing much to explore The jokes were weaker the characters were uninteresting in most of the parts I would say they did not utilise them rightly The good thing is it is a watchable film but the majority wont like it Usually Sony animations were met with underwhelmingly and seeing the response it had got surely there will be no sequel at least for now,Negative
 This movie has gender politics  Despite the shocking ratings for this movie its actually better than the other childrens release at the moment which also suffers from gender politics the Ninjago Movie Who is pushing sexism on young children Why is it always one sided sexism The Ninjago movie lacked heart The Emoji movie has heart especially due to T J Millers performance You end up liking most of the characters However the story is very predictable and leaves little to the imagination This is what separates this movie from a Pixar movie Pixar movies have heart and brainsIf you really have to pick a movie for the holiday season for your children get out an old movie so you dont have to deal with the gender politics why are men always taking credit for what women do type of garbage If youre desperate for a cinema experience pick the Emoji movie,Negative
When the trailer came out I too fell victim to the hate train hype this movie was building Is the movie good No Is it the worst thing ever Probably not I understand the hate this is getting seeing how absurd the subject matter is In execution it is less bad than it is just generic and forgettable Many people thought this would be a so bad its good flick Its not bad enough to pull that off Its also not bad enough to be insulting and painful to watch It really is just a generic kids film In my experience the movie went by pretty quickly and I never really felt too bored or offended Once the hate hype dies down no one will remember this film,Negative
Best movie ever to exist Watch this before you decide to hate it,Negative
This movie was SO darn cringy I dont EVEN know why some people LIKE this movie it is the definition of one word GARBAGE,Negative
Its weird that the movies main character is the Meh Emoji and so so fitting Its a pretty formulated movie about an emoji who does not just want to be one thing and goes on a journey though a kids phone to prevent from getting deleted for being able to do multiple faces The movie is somewhat satire on social media apps and how we communicate with one another these days  I did like one part in which a teacher is teaching kids about hieroglyphics the original emojis All the big names like face book and Instagram make an appearance in the film There were a few big laughs in the movie Its one of those things where there making fun of one of the apps and if you use that app or understand how its used than it will give you a chuckle but man its so funny how the film is as lackluster as the emoji they picked as the main character Hollywood needs some new ideashttpcinemagardenscom,Negative
Just dontEvilHateMeant to hurt viewerStupidDumbIntense irritationNo Just no,Negative
Im not going to be as rough on this as the rest of the users on IMdB are  rating As a matter of fact Ill use a character from the movie to describe it Meh Thats right There was nothing good or bad about this movie It just kind unfolded in front of my glazed eyes over the screen There were a few chuckles but no laughs And those who say its offensive No A poop emoji is not offensive This story stars the emoji misfits Meh High Five  Hacker on their quest to have lives and to save themselves from being deleted from the smart phone They fight against Smiler who runs the emojis with an iron smile trollers and malware bots This movie would have made zero sense less than  years ago and the movie is fading from my memory as I write this review about it Not exciting not boring Save yourself from a meh evening,Negative
"Cinemascore polled audiences after watching the movie and the average rating was B on a scale from F to A This means this movie generally was given ratings from C to A I give it an AI know too well
 Not to trust the otten critiques from RT because  of the time theyre grossly inaccurate and wrong
 Take IMDB reviews w a grain of saltI was surprised on youtube this movie had so man dislikes Im sure those people never even saw the movie and passed judgment exclusively based on the trailerI just watched the movie at home on my laptop
I must say I am glad I ignored all the hate and dislikes online and gave this movie a tryThis movie was well animated The voice acting was great The storyconflictcharacter developmentclimaxending were all entertaining and enjoyableThis is a memorable movie It is fine for kids adolescents and adults up to their sThis movie was entertaining and fun to watch It was never boring I have nothing but positive things to say about this movie  stars",Negative
Im sorry for anyone who thinks that  is an unfair rating because its only a kids movie but thats not a good enough excuse Saying that is completely unfair as there have been loads of movies for kids that have been well done with funny jokes for kids and adults with a unique art style and a heartwarming plot Kids movies that didnt seem like it wasnt checked enough and movies that had actual effort put into it The emoji movie does not have any effort put into it and even someone who is very young can tell that most of the jokes in the emoji movie are lazy and stupid and the plot is laughable not to mention its basically an advert you have to pay for Its just a movie to attract kids and get a lot of money You might enjoy the emoji movie but I would NOT recommend it The emoji movie makes me sick,Negative
I had to leave the theatre in the middle of the movie it was so dreadful that I didnt even want to finish watching it The story line is terrible and the movie is not entertaining It is much more suitable for a younger audience than for adults This movie was way worse than I expected considering the low ratings it was already given,Negative
This film was a failure before it was even released Outraged internet personalities and millions of their followers spreading negative but truthful viewpoints on the teaser for this film alone spelt disaster for the heartless Sony company known as Sony Pictures AnimationNow I will admit I have enjoyed a few of their films in the past However it seems as if Sony is following the same corporate rabbit hole as Dreamworks Animation creating quick cash grabs for a safe and significant profit This is a very poor business route for Sony and will in the long run damage their reputation as if it was not low enoughThe only possible ways I could see future films like this rising from hell would be from other heartless corporations sponsoring this horrible business practice I fear for the future of excellently animated film concepts ever reaching out of preproduction,Negative
Im going to say this movie ruins everything about emojis Emojis started pretty bad They got worse and worse from all the teenagers Now they make a movie about it What is next THE MEME MOVIE,Negative
Watched this with our  and  year old They loved it and we did toosuper surprised it was rated an average of  on here ,Negative
This is one of the most god awful movies ever Sony animations is running out of ideas or they just suck,Negative
I hate this film to the bone This film sucks on so many levels that Im impressed on how bad the emoji movie is It wasnt even watchable I didnt see it in theaters because I thought it was going to be garbage So I saw it on Netflix and boy o boy I regret it The emoji movie was boring unfunny it had horrible characters and a horrible plot Im not even joking this is one of the worst movies Ive ever seen Id rather watch Batman and robin again or transformers again This movie is a product placement dumpster fire Dont ever see it dont even see it on Netflix,Negative
Wow Just wow thanks a lot for this thing that is just SO SHIwhat next the slender man film oh no wait,Negative
The Emoji Movie and The Garbage Pail Kids are tied for the worst movie I have ever seenFor those that dont know The Garbage Pail Kids Movie is an s movie based on a card game And boy that movie was horrible The Garbage Pail KIds themselves all look ugly and are poorly designed You should see the Nostaglia Critic review on this and The Emoji Movie because The Garbage Pail Kids just absolutely broke Doug Walker the hostOnto The Emoji Movie First off who came up with this Its cringy and full of stupidity Second the charecters are all brats Jailbreak is always acting so bossy even when shes not the one in trouble High was the worst one of allHe has a very annoying voice terrible humor and just useless in the journey except for just causing more chaos Gene was boring hardly did anything However I must give some credit to the animatio in this movie its amazing But still save your time and moneyScore ,Negative
I saw this movie in theatres with my three kids and I actually really like it I think people are expecting far too much from a kids movie Its fun to watch and much better than I expected Until you have sat through Captain Underpants the Movie you cant possibly know what a terrible kids movie really is My kids all loved it and I liked it enough to see it again,Negative
Come on everybody it was silly and was really cringy,Negative
I saw this movie ironically instead of seeing Wonder Woman with my family I immediately regretted it I thought that when i left I would be laughing at its stupidity but after I left I just felt sad and didnt talk too much This movie is not worth seeing ironically or at all unless you are  This movie is stupid and I hate it with all my heart,Negative
Without spoiling anything I can just say that this movie is a unbroken chain of commercials If commercials were tumors then this movie would be with fullbody spread terminal cancerThe only redeeming fact is that Patrick Stewart does a voiceover I can only hope they paid him well,Negative
Why WHY The movie is terrible Dont waste your time on this Even if youre gonna watch the movie ironically the only positive thing is the graphics Thats it Nothing else The story is badthe music is mehthe characters are reallyreally bad ,Negative
Thought it would be so bad that it was funny it was so bad it wasnt even funny,Negative
I hate this so much and has thankfully stayed away from it so I havent watch it in other words  It ripoffs two excellent movies inside out and wreckitRalph for some bad advertisement And they also wanted to cancel a movie that looked good for this garbage But I give it a  out of  because its bad but not as bad as Foodfight,Negative
I feel sorry for the people who actually went to the cinemas and watched this movie I feel even sadder for the voice actors This movie was just a big step back in their career Who even thinks of this hecking storyline you seriously have to hate the world and all of its beauties to create such an abomination of a movie Ive seen the movie ATM which was a movie about a friggin ATM bullcrappery that made me search for the Director and find him and ask him how can someone make such a shitty movie and it was a better movie than this,Negative
made me want to commit genocide and suicide at the same time theres not much else to say really kids might enjoy this but I assure you they will also enjoy kids movies that are actually good such as Pixar films which wont make adults want to gauge their eyes out in conclusion this is a soulless mess of a movie that will make you lose youre will to live,Negative
We are having a protest up here me and a thousand other people who died in the cinemas are asking God to kill those who created this movie We need to avenge the suffering of children parents and these  yo toddlers who havent had the chance to experience the real world yet PS No offense to any Christians this was just a joke,Negative
i cant begin to describe how bad this is so just watch this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjVmBlRjCmc i mean seriously did this song predict  but back on topic the emoji movie is absolute trash this movie could have been goodactually no my final review ismeh no angry face emoji,Negative
This is a stupid movieFirst of all this is the most stupid movie ever seen in my life Do not emoji they want to escape from their world Its sheer nonsense Second they only did it to earn more money They could have taken The third film from Hotel Transilvania but do not guess That have This film ridicule and third thanks to this movie they canceled Popeye and now a live action movie I hope Get out fast Hotel Transilvania THANK YOU SONY FOR THIS STUPID MOVIE MOVIE Atte A viewer for Sony Animation fans,Negative
This movie is amazingly terrible and poorly written that it makes Mein Kampf look good I have come to the realization that every second you watch the movie you could spend on doing something equally meaningless that however wont put money into the pockets of these idiots I predict that this movie will bee the catalyst for Kim Jong Un to finally nuke the westAs a movie  As a casus beli,Negative
I watched this movie for free and I still felt ripped off I watched this with a friend and yet it wasnt funny This is a truly awful movie which shouldnt exist It could have been good Just look at the Lego movie Thats all the proof you need Dont watch this Just dont Patrick Stewart went from Logan to this Let that sink in before watching this,Negative
It is an embarrassment to call this a movie This was so bad Started off in Textopolis which already sounds bad but it gets worse Then he meets some hacker and goes on an over dramatized quest to become a real emoji In other words its literally some idiot trying to fit in The ending was super predictable but if you actually want to see it get it off of one of those free movie websites,Negative
 of the way into this movie it becomes obvious that TJ Miller and Tony Leonids have started spending way too much time in TJs trailer with what must have been a special hybrid created by Willie and Snoop called On The Ho Again I have never seen a movie go so far off the rails and never find its way back to the train yard much less the tracks It was just one long commercial and the Dance Dance Revolution section was so long they were obviously trying to justify how much they overpaid you know who to be in it Chris Pratt I swear Anna if you say one more thing trying to defend that piece of crap Anna But it had Patrick Stewart in it Front door Slam,Negative
After watching the cancerous Tumor that is the emoji movie I have finally come to a revelation all western animation has gone to absolute sht I have giving up on life And I should end it before the fidget spinner movie trailer is released and the fidget spinner  emoji movie crossover I could honestly make a better movie with my ass and compared to this movie it would be an Oscar winner God is dead Kill me,Negative
Is there really no creativity left Is there no shame in releasing such a schmata Is there really no topic one could pick besides retarded emojis Stop Please please stop No more Because if there will be more then the world will turn into a  version of the world in Idiocracy and the next big movies will be called A and the next big TV show will be Ow my balls And it goes beyond movies like this  its as if  big movies that come out are just literally cinematic fastfood  no thought given Literally none at all Just make something,Negative
I dont agree with the reviews on this movie at all and neither does my  year old daughter I loved the story line as well as the animation I work in the cell phone industry and so felt especially attached to the concept Liked that it brought this element of technology to life,Negative
If cancerous memes were a film this would be that film Harambe Bad Luck Brian and that ermahgerd girl wouldnt look out of place in this film because all it is and could realistically ever be is an attempt at relatability and absolute filthy pandering to a younger audience than those who could possibly understand a hidden agendaIm pretty sure this film is a blockbuster classic in another universe one where Trump is a good man and Obama was born in Kenya Thats right Opposite Universe which is ironically a film I would rather watch than this crock of memedustI needed to take  scalding acid showers to forget this film and this review will cause me to take a couple moreEw,Negative
Im just doing something to help other humans dont watch this movie and just be on your merry way do something more interesting and simply better Hopefully this is not the end of Western culture Its simply terrible that studios are ready to go to such lengths and have such disrespect for their audience that they sht out that kind of garbage If historians ever look back to our times they will probably pin the beginning of our demise to this dreadful movie,Negative
Like virtually everyone is saying this movie is terrible I cannot put into words how bad it is How anyone with the intelligence of a pebble can give it a star rating is mindboggling The humor is horrible the animation is mediocre at best and the writing is almost as bad as Norm of the North And that was also an incredibly horrible movie as wellIm not going to put any spoilers in this review Its not worth more of my time Read someone elses review for more info if you really want it,Negative
So everyone is complaining how its this awful movie and that they wish they could rate it  stars but honestly its good I love action movies like this thought it was a lot like wreck it ralph and inside out very funny and actually made me laugh tehe,Negative
You can tell the only people who made any efforts to make this film are the artists and the animators besides that this whole thing is just an advert this movie is sht and its almost despicable that they even made this movieThis is probably the worse time ive ever had watching a movie,Negative
The Emoji Movie is not just any bad movie but a stupid and incompetent one Ive seen worse but this movie is bad It doesnt even seem like a family friendly movie to me at all Illogical cringeworthy and just disgusting The Emoji Movie is one of the sorriest movies of all time and contains jokes inferior to literally any comedic family friendly movie,Negative
Cancelled Popeye for this smh why,Negative
If you gave this movie a  out of  then youre just stupid and i cant take your opinion seriously This movie was boring not funny and was just  product placement after another I saw this movie for free and still felt i got robbed,Negative
My granddaughters and I enjoyed it a lot Its a kid movie so Im not sure why the adult reviews are so harsh Kids like it so thats all that matters,Negative
I honestly dont think this was so bad as everyone says it it Yes maybe its not great and all but it is a kids movie We have probably all seen something like this before but I think theres something else to it,Negative
s cinematic abortion that nobody wanted A vapid pandering waste of creativity that has more in common with a bowel movement Than an actual film,Negative
This isnt that bad of a film But I think they could do better This film is about emojis exploring the world of a phone but its not the worst movie,Negative
Not gonna waste words on this flick The worst movie I have ever seen Just want to get wrecked by a train just want to embrace my death I am going guys I cant live in the same world where I have watched films like  Angry men and the Before Trilogy that grabbed your interest even with minimal sources and on the other Hand there is this Advertisement that killed my hopes of living a great life ahead I am feeling suffocated I can see Death I PS He couldnt make it I am his brother RIP Nakul Sharma ,Negative
This movie had so much talent but was a huge letdown to me as a somewhat expected it to be better with Maya Rudolph Its okay for little kids but anyone over  most likely would be bored Overall this movie couldve been better and it really sucked,Negative
The emoji movie is filled with bright characters and a new take on the animation genre Whilst most say this movie was made as an advertisement for certain companies and I cant hesitate do do the Emoji Pop during parties,Negative
This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my lifetime if not the worst the story line is all over the place and the character development is just sad if I was this movie i would just end it already There was no chance or hope in the beginning for this movie So save your  and go see a different movie,Negative
Where do I even begin with this film The writing is just a rip off of other better movies characters are unlikeable the animation looks so cheap,Negative
"Who and why on Earth would give this movie  even if I would be paid by Sony out of dignity I would refuse to rate this higher than 
Just imagine that none of the titles from the Top  have above The Shawshank Redemption and God Father but this one does
No it is not god extremely bad story very bad voice acting low budget animation product placement galore noting about this movie is good go watch some commercials for free its better than this",Negative
What if you had someone watch this at gunpoint They would become the creepy dudes from Life of Luxury I kinda felt like one after this wretched movie was over,Negative
I went to see this movie with my yearold sister She really enjoyed it Its the first movie she saw this year where she wanted to stay until the end I dont know why its been so harshly criticised its lighthearted and funny I would definitely recommend it for children they dont analyse the plot like they are some Darth Vader critics I must say I enjoyed it as well For anyone who watches it I hope you enjoy it as much as we did,Negative
Theres a lot of hate on this movie and some is not entirely without merit Actually one of the  star reviewer almost got to me until he mentioned Angry Birds arguable but especially the Lego movies You cant put those in the same bin as this The Lego movies especially really have a quality to them that speaks to both adults and children Something this movie does not haveBut is it like a disease as some have suggested Id say not I do get the corporate idea thing that they try to shove into our brain Lets keep it real though that always existed And this movie tries to bank on that It doesnt really succeed and while it tries to copy a couple of things Pixar and other animated movies did it never reaches that quality Having said that Ive seen worse  and I know that is not an excuse for some concerning my rating but its the truth,Negative
but fails to deliverEver since Ive seen the trailer for this movie Ive been looking forward to seeing it The trailer promised so much but in the end it was one of those movies that had all the best bits shown in the trailerThe concept for the movie is original and I was expecting the narrative to be another Despicable Me The Lego Movie or Wreck It Ralph level quality Unfortunately from this reviewers point of view it wasntThe movie has good moments but they were far and few between to save it from its lowly ratingI tried to like this movie but with characters that failed to connect with me and too many tryhard moments it just disappointedAnyone older than  will probably find this movie tedious,Negative
Maybe its a symptom of lockdown but watch a film as shallow and empty as this and find still find some joyThe film is not subtle nor smart in anyway Its product placement is in your face and the characters are  dimensional It is clear that people thought the premise was enough to make the film work and they didnt need to bother with plot drama or decent jokesBut i still found it just about watchable which is probably due to the amount of utter rubbish I have already watched in the last year,Negative
The idea that emoji have emotions is on first hand terrifying bad but in other hand it could be funIs itIt is produced in Sony Pictures AnimationThe director is Tony LeonidHe is obviously complexes by being differentHe said that movie is very personal to himThe animation is very flat and badThis is actually most fast made movie ever Voice cast is only thing that is OK and high rated T J Miller James Corden Anna Faris PlotNot so bad if you ask meVery straight forwardfor kidsI will not talk about it for no making spoilers CharactersFlat as emoji ALL IN ALLflat movie for kids that dont mind what are they looking at All time I felt like I watching adsIll give  stars for voice casting and  star because of OK jokesworld inside your phone and not being very bad,Negative
She broke up with me after seeing the movie with her ,Negative
Annoyingboring and so may advertismentsjust a waste of timeits so baddont watch it,Negative
"Entertraining and relevant funny and flowing We enjoyed it a lot
Cant understand the bad reviews Its great kids movie and parents can get laughs too",Negative
I think the producer didnt take serious about the movie making here the plot is not right It should be more smooth and with logic story but i know some movies didnt use the logical ideas but still can be interesting but not with this one I think the stars rating shows all regards,Negative
This could have been something enjoyable but it fails to generate any interest TJ Miller I always find entertaining but his voice over character is not giving much of any interest neither does any of the animated characters You really dont get infested into there doing Trying to hard to be another Wreckit Ralph and you can see how hard it was tryingNow the animation is pretty to look at showing life inside an IPhone But if thats all the movie has going for it Only children can be forgiving of this but adults not so much,Negative
This movie is so bad that philosophically it starts to make you question what makes a bad movie and what the different types of bad are This movie is probably bad in the worst way possible  its empty and soulless This isnt art This isnt something that tried and missed its mark Its a manufactured product using a storebought justaddwater story Its the cinematic equivalent of a TV dinner Now TV dinners are edible but are they really nourishing This movie isnt a failure The story is fine and complete But its soulless,Negative
Its a lego movie but garbage jailbreak is just like wildstyle gene is just like emmet the original character and i hate him hes voice is annoying just like james corden but only  star because patrick stuwart is in this and i like professor x and picard from star trek,Negative
This movie is awesome What is everyone else talking about,Negative
Colourful bright with lovely animation The story is decent fairly clich kids movie younger kids will probably love it less so for older kids The product placement is very very heavy handed and conspicuous and its meme attempts are laughably bad Kids are unlikely to notice but theres some so bad its good novelty for the older viewers Overall it has okay character and message that even adults can quite enjoy and get somewhat immersed in Its overall very OK I would rate  star if it wasnt so ridiculously full of product placement and their strong female character is quite forced Seriously strong women dont need to constantly reassert how strong and independent they are The message of this movie USE DROPBOX PLAY CANDY CRUSH AND DDR AND DID YOU KNOW DROPBOX IS SECURE Oh and be yourself and accept everyone for who they are Gene the main character is a meh emoji and that reflects the movie Its just meh,Negative
The lack of pacing and an absolute absence of plot depth made watching this a tiring exercise of patience When I wasnt cringing at the stupidly unfunny jokes and product placement I found myself rolling my eyes at the ridiculously predictable dialogue When I wasnt rolling my eyes I was desperately checking the running time which I did about every ten or fifteen minutes Once it was finally over I lied facedown on my bed willing any memories of having watched The Emoji Movie to leave my now much smaller brain However I can now live a far happier life knowing that I will never have to subject my ears and eyeballs to this movie again,Negative
Its a great midnight movie I suggest that you watch it and drink at the same time Dont have high expectations for this film Patrick Stewarts poo so Have  shot before going into the theater See it now I love jailbreak because shes a girl Jake Paul is a bad person ITs EVERYDAY BRO WITH THE Disney CHANNEL FLOW  MIL IN  MONTHS NEVER DONE BEFORE,Negative
it was bad as much as I would like to say it wasnt it really is only a one time watch movie and  if for some ODD reason youre an emoji fan than you would maybe like it but i dont know why because it has poor story line poor acting  just plain plain  plain BORING  glad I watched online and not wastes  dollars plus  on snacks at the movies they had a chance to make a better movie with this crazy famous characters  yet they throw it away almost like  the characters are so famous no one will care lets just throw it out there it will be great lets just continue milking the emojis of course having it on I phones  pillows  shirts isnt enough ,Negative
Worst movie ever My kid didnt know what to say when I asked him at the end did you like it The answer was Ill tell you later This movie is hard to be understood by kids less than  years old they have to know about dropbox twitter or firewall I am happy i dont have to see it again my kind never mentioned anything about it,Negative
Look I know that everyone is dumping on this movie and honestly I dont see why This movie was bad like that other movie that came out in  and we all knew would suck and when it came out sucked ghostbusters anyone Nobody was surprised that this sucks nobody was sitting slack jawed in the theater going OH MY GOD THIS LOOKED SO GOOD IN THE TRAILERS if you want to see the movie just watch the trailers because honestly thats all you need to see The characters are basically described with one phrase Jean is the special one Jailbreak is the strong female character  and high five is the  comic relief None of this movie is original none of this movie is good It is just a blatant cash grab from a terrible company who has no clue what anyone is interested in these days I made an account just to review this movie and I dont think Ill do it again unless I see a fidget spinner movie in two years,Negative
This movie has absolutely no entertainment in it what so ever Remember when everyone played with their fidget spinners All it did was spin round and you were supposed to watch it Not entertaining at all However its much doing that was a lot more fun that watching this waste of time No I did not walk of the theater although I felt like doing it I had to this atrocity until the end I gave the Emoji Movie a chance and I regretted it HARD Its wonderful background and animation however might be one of the only advantages about the film The scenery and visuals are stunning in all seriousness The Emoji Movie offers very little entertainment its original and its a waste of time Save your money instead of going out to see this garbage Ill just keep playing with my fidget spinner FK THE EMOJI MOVIE,Negative
I just watched this movie and now I hate my life I cant fathom the words to describe how awful this product is Egregious Product placement Terrible dialogue Terrible voice acting The concept is just so ridiculously awful that even the most talented director couldnt make this decent Lets not forget the humour The whole time I felt like I was just melting away at the colours and shapes moving I resent this movies existence,Negative
I found that this movie worked surprisingly well as a form of discipline Prior to July th  when my children did something bad I would punish them by taking away their devices or dessert you know the norm Unfortunately this method never deemed sufficient as they would still repeat their actions However when my youngest Timmy called my oldest Todd a stinky pile of bologna I knew what I had to do I marched little Timmy to the car drove to the nearest cinema and purchased two tickets to The Emoji Movie Rest assured he will never call Todd anything ever again Or sleep at night But you know you have to take the bad with the good,Negative
Great movie inspired me to do great things in live,Negative
Im done No more Im sick of how people are saying that its good Its a notorious unwanted cringe worthy godforsaken movie that Sony ever made THEY CANCELLED POPEYE FOR THIS CRAP IM DONE I am sick of how people are saying that the emoji movie is good its not Cant you see the ratings and cringe in this movie Im done with Sony,Negative
If I could rank this a zero I absolutely would At least with a movie like Manos The Hands of Fate you KNOW someone tried their hardest and you can somewhat appreciate that There is not one second of consideration put into any frame of this film Every character is bland every design is generic every joke and plot thread is predictableIts a desperate and I do mean desperate attempt to capitalize on a growing and recent trend Its a moneygrabber to say the least You take a subject popular with young kids you get paid by a bunch of different companies to display their terrible apps in the movie etc etc This movie had no passion Movies are made to make money but they are typically a labour of love Most directors put their heart and souls into their films while clearly no one cared about this oneI feel bad for Patrick Stewart Please do not give one cent to the makers of this movie,Negative
Whose idea was it to make and produce this complete and utter steaming pile of sh Oh wait that was one of the dreadful jokes in this horrific excuse for a movie I wouldnt see this movie if someone paid me a million dollars to let alone  Everyone involved in this product should be ashamed of themselves they are a disgrace to the filmmaking industry and should hand in their resignation,Negative
I dont know exactly why it is underrated Yeah it is mostly crappy and lacks substance but still it reaches to put a smile on your face Theres low chances you may have no fun watching it Its entertaining intriguing and keeps you engaged throughout it I thought the average meh ratings would be  or  but are below that Anyway dont let reviews fully influence you to watch or not a film In the end its up to you and you have the choice whether to see it or not,Negative
Who ever made this movie I feel sorry for There was no great content or storyline I felt I got dumber watching it by the second,Negative
You know the type Its so terrible its amazing Yeah this is on my list They have some very talented voice actors so Ill give them that but thats all this project was to them an acting jobBut I dont know what else to put for this review Im just filling the space to make the character mark I originally watched this film because I enjoy Liam Aikens work as well as the other more prominent names and the film about emojiswas as good as could be expected from a movie where emojis have emotionsHave I reached  yetIts not amazing writing or amazing acting but it isan emoji movie,Negative
"Watched this with my  year old daughter and really enjoyed it Was shocked to see that it had a  rating Gave it a  in order to offset that horrible rating because it deserves better
The movie concept was unique and had an interesting perspective Just like Toy Story brought our toys to life this movie brings your appsemojis to life and I thought the concept was executed really well There were also some good lines in the script
Deserves  stars",Negative
Would have been a  if the ending was better If they just let everyone die at the end it would have at least been a ,Negative
Its bad  just bad  I felt like watching an ads not a movie  and the story is very not good  I was bored watching this movie,Negative
"I remember many years ago when this movie came out and I saw the trailer It felttoo odd to where I purposely chose to pass on watching it Randomly I saw it on Netflix so I figured it cant hurt actually to watch itYes It did hurt this movie is beyond bad and deserves its awards for being badThe only possible good part of this movie lies with the character designs Everything else is terrible beyond belief Its not even possible for me to describe every single bad thing in this movieTo only address some of the flaws
Story holes
Lack of explanations
Wrong emotions in various scenes
Some propaganda
etc",Negative
The Emoji Movie is an exciting adventure with memorable characters and complete with hilarious jokes and clever themes Oh sorry thats what you WISH it was This movie is so unbelievably terrible that Sony had to put SO much effort into SpiderMan Into the SpiderVerse just to make up for this piece of Sir Patrick Stewart who by the way plays a poop emoji Thats pretty much the movie in a nutshell But if you want a more extensive answer the movie is boring the characters are forgettable the script is awful the jokes are cringeworthy the premise is beyond stupid the animation is just OK and the less I say about the bucketload of product placement the better This may just be the worst animated movie of all time,Negative
"Everybody should watch this movie
I laughed
I cried Just because of all that laughter
I feeled with the CharactersThis movie is just great
Could easily be better than Find NemoNo I am not getting paid for thisThe movie is just good",Negative
This movie was embarrassing to watch especially because of James Cordon I will be talking a lot about him because he is my nemesis even though he does not know me His voice acting in this movie was squeaky and embarrassing His acting and voice acting and horrible tv show should be studied in a lab because it should be considered toxic waste He thinks he is funny because he has those dumb car music thingys were he gets be lost celebrities on most of them and they sings songs that were only famous  years ago Shame on you James Cordon Your jokes are not funny and you should just quit as nobody find you funny other than  year old uncles who work at the dmv,Negative
Its boring offensive and the morals are just shoved down our throats,Negative
There was some movies who I turned off in the middle of it This one was super bad but somehow I managed to watch it till the end Still one of the worst I ever saw,Negative
I was pleasantly surprised that it wasnt as bad as many people made it out to beIt has all the ingredients of a good movie but misses the mark when it comes to delivery Its like it just didnt manage to reach what Sony was hoping for but their concepts and ideas around life on the phone was actually very well thought outThis movie does NOT deserve the hate it gets  not by a long shot but its also not one I would recommend because it didnt reach what it was aiming for Definitely a missed opportunityIf youre curious and wanna check it out  at worst youd be a bored At best youll find that you actually like it and some of the humor in it somewhatNot a recommend but not an avoid either,Negative
"Is they biggest dog shint i ever SEE the story is so generic the characters they are no originali dont understand they people who likes this movie the human who haves the phone
Why they put it  Its horrible if they dont put that Moments they movie a litlle better in summary You waste time in your live seeing this movie is a long ad",Negative
Yes the rumors of how bad it is are quite true But look Everybody makes mistakes from time to time and this was one of the worst from the studio Yeah there were Smurf movies but those just were made from greed This one just feels like Battlefield Earth made by a cultThe story is boring and steals plot elements from other better movies the animation has some good qualities but other cringy parts that take over the voice acting sucks the tone is obnoxious and its filled to the brim with PRODUCT PLACEMENT I was waiting for a time when it would cut to a commercial midway or advertise mypillow in the middle of the film Or have someone scream IAMNOTOKAY in the middle at the top of their lungs,Negative
As you can tell I loved this movie it was very funny and interesting Im joking I would rather k I l l m y s e l f then watch this ever AGIAN,Negative
I dont even know where to begin with this movieI guess Id start off with the writing is so bad I cant believe I sat though the hole movie I almost got up and leftAnd all the jokes are media based which makes sense as it is a movie about emojis but the jokes are so badI am also not a big fan of James Corden so that also made me dislike this movie even moreThe only thing I really like about this movie is that Patrick Stewart voice the poop emojiOver all really bad movie Id only recommend this movie for Little kids,Negative
Me and my son Muhammad were shocked how this great and funny D movie whose budget is  million dollars is so underrated and hated The film centers on Gene a multiexpressional emoji who lives in a teenagers phone and who sets out on a journey to become a normal meh emoji like his parentsMy son Muhammad and I laughed and saw this movie too entertaining for kids and adults and the thing that convinces us to see despite the unstoppable attack on it is that it has already reached number  in the US Box Office and that many openminded people did not believe the malicious hatred against a quality movie like this,Negative
When I went to go watch it with my little cousin I literally did not want to watch it but I had to and it sucked idk why they wasted so much money on a lame movie,Negative
This movies got better characters than Prince of Egypt better jokes than Into The Spiderverse a better concept than Lego Movie a better villain than Hunchback of Notre Dame its emotional moments are stronger than The Incredibles its romance better than Beauty and the Beast its got such a wellfitting theme about feminism and lets not forget the BEST DANCE EVER the emoji pop Truly an unforgettable experience,Negative
This movie is so bad i dont want to watch the last  mins of itit has promoted content and i dont even understand how the wanted to realese thisi think most people hate this fcking title and i hope streaming services will take this down forever,Negative
The reason this isnt a onestar review is because it has decent animation and its a good torture mechanism,Negative
My     year olds love this movie and ask to watch it everyday My husband and I really enjoyed it too It doesnt have a lot of music but definitely keeps the kids attention The movie reminded my husband and I of Reck it Ralph I cant understand why this movie was reviewed so poorly,Negative
Not sure why all the s OK itll never be Frozen but a cute little movie the kids I took adored Beautifully made with some iconic references to apps and services,Negative
"How to teach ignorance to children a poop movie and story for kids  years old Already from trailer it was understood that is was horribile
The worst movie I ever seen in my life",Negative
James corden is the only good part bad and unemotional voice acting Very bad storyline and sweet part,Negative
This movie is honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen The amount of laziness and flaws in this film is just painful Lets go over some pointsStory Literally every animated movie ever Guy is bullied he wants to change he has opportunity to change he realises hes good the way he is everyone loves him after he saves the dayCharacters I have seen straight lines more dimensional than any of these characters It feels like they have  personality trait eachAnimation This is the only thing I will give the movie credit for apart from a few slipups the animation is actually decentSoundtrack They pretty much just take anything from the Top  on the radio And its all pop songs made for kids under the age of Acting Dreadful they hired some random celebrities and cast Patrick Stewart as a poop emoji The man who played Professor X in all of the Xmen films is playing a poop emojiAll in all dont watch this film if you dont want to subject yourself to pain This is truly one of the worst animated films ever made,Negative
This movie was terrible thats all I can say Terrible horrible the worst movie Ive ever watched Thats all,Negative
The Emoji Movie has one of the most abstract interesting and unique plot lines ever seen in Cinema This excellency is not just in the plot line of the movie With the fleeting quality in recent movies the Emoji Movie is a breath of fresh air The characters are realistic and interesting For example the character Gene is one of the best portrayals of a person with a problem of fitting in Personally this movie ranks up with Casablanca,Negative
Feels like it tries hard to convey an interesting story but it ends up being dull and irritating,Negative
Really disgusting movie is only barely acceptable on the first  minutes the remaining  minutes can be defined as glorified advertisingThe visuals are perhaps the only acceptable thing about this movie but who watch a movie expecting those to be good And if you do then there are countless films do it betterThe story progresses in a painfully slow way and is packed with filler what else did you expect they Have to make time for the perpetual advertising also is very inconsistent and full of plot holes and things just dont make senseThe characters are annoying and very few arent worth of hateMy most sincere condolences to the people paid the ticket price for a minute long ad,Negative
After the secret life of your toys the secret life of insects the secret world of monsters under your bed and the patently ridiculous secret world inside your brain is it so surprising that some braindead executives would attempt the secret world inside your phone More kids these days care about phones than toys or their own brain so wouldnt that make it more important All those people who praised Inside Out to the skies are to blame for this monstrosity of a movie and the Emoji Movie is the next logical step for hooey childrens entertainment,Negative
Im appalled that slop like this can be played on screens that can even hover over Dexter or breaking bad just disgusting the humor is terrible not even funny to children and dont get me started on the animation the art direction was non existent or it was there but the only advice was souless just in shock anyone can give this a greater grade than  if this movie is lucky just souless slop dont watch this no matter what,Negative
" I need to see cuter faces and Artstyle Make Gene not look like he had been beaten up
 I fan this movie in terms of character creation

No story here Nothing worth watching Just a waste of time and yes it contains rude humour Why would I want to watch this We couldnt even get through the first few minutes,Negative
Bad An unctreative and uninteresting concept that was wasted more than it needed to be,Negative

The movie has a very generic story bad character design bland setting average animation and voice acting the dialogue is boring and doesnt sound natural and the biggest problem of all the movie is filled with unsubtle ads for example in one scene they play candy crush and theres a voice that says CANDY CRUSH and the logo pops up in another scene the characters are in Spotify in yet another scene they are in Dropbox talking about how safe it is and to top it all of they are in different social medias like Facebook Twitter and Instagram Its like watching an hour and a half of ads Dont watch this movie even ironically it is that badConclusion dont watch this under any circumstance other than wanting to torture yourself,Negative
Im utterly baffled about who is the intended audience for this film It is probably meant for younger viewers but it clearly looks down on modern youth as easily impressionable simple minded and not tech savvy Are they trying to appeal to youth or insult them Any modern child or teen can see through this stereotype and the relentless technical inaccuracies The other reviews have pointed out the other major flaws so I wont go into detail  this film is plagiarised messy and padded with advertising and meaningless filler content The visual animation quality was actually pretty good though,Negative
Another summer and another summer movie Awesome animation but not for everyone,Negative
What is the point of this movie get it out of here,Negative

"Truly awful Its genuinely painful to watch This movie is not one of those its so bad that its good no its just the worst
Also I have never seen a movie with so much advertisement in it Feels more like watching an ad than a movie",Negative
Theres a scene where they all get killed by an emoji coming out of the screen,Negative
This movie was just hot garbage Id rather watch my dog be put down again on a loop for an hour and a half Just a waste of time,Negative
Look I aint gonna listen to the critics badmouthing this movie because Ive found it very entertaining I think Gene Meh is adorable alongside with Hi and the indie chick emoji Jailbreak with the exceptions of the Poop emoji with a bad taste in dialogue and Smiley who I personally think is a real b There are other badly criticized flicks I will agree by the critics with like Care Bears Movie II A New Generation Tom and Jerry the Movie and my two worst nightmares The Cat in the Hat and Foodfight,Negative
As its one of the worst animated movies ever made The Emoji Movie is also possibly the worst animated movie to be produced by a mainstream animation studio This is an example of how Hollywood can sometimes be lazy and pile all these issues into one horrible film The writing is at its worst the story has no originality whatsoever the animation is terribly executed the jokes are an embarrassment the message coming from this movie feels outdated the characters are all a bunch of jerks the voice actors didnt even try and the entire world building is the high definition of cringe Everybody do me one favor If you want to keep your sanity dont watch this movie at all Dont even show this to kids in general Very justifiable to win a razzie but I also believing in deleting this movie permanently,Negative
Like ok this movie is the emoji movie but Ive seen some trash  like TRASH and this is just a stupid harmless movie for kidsThis is a movie by committee dont get me wrong but its overall inoffensive,Negative
The characters are bad the pacing is bad everything is dated and its bat,Negative
I think the best way to describe this masterpiece of cosmic horror is with a quote from an other masterpieceDo you think god stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what hes createdSteve Buscemi spy kids ,Negative
Emoji is a film that revolves around the world of emojis and attempts to create a story from it Unfortunately the film falls flatThe films plot is shallow and predictable lacking creative ideas and a compelling story to engage the audience Instead it feels like a marketing ploy to capitalize on the popularity of emojisThe characters are onedimensional and clichd offering little development or opportunities for the audience to connect with them The dialogue is uninspired and at times even frustrating lacking genuine substance and originalityThe animation in the film is technically competent but that alone cannot compensate for the lack of quality and substance It seems that the film primarily aims to attract young viewers with colorful visuals rather than tell a captivating storyThe jokes and humor in the film are flat and forced with few genuinely funny moments to make the audience laugh Instead it relies on tired clichs and wordplay that quickly become tiresomeOverall Emoji deserves a rating of  The film disappoints on many levels offering little that makes it worth watching It lacks a compelling plot welldeveloped characters and original humor For anyone looking for a quality film Emoji is definitely not recommended,Negative
Great graphics and cute Its a cross between Inside Out and Reck it Ralph The jokes arent funny I hardly laughed at all Im  yeat old female and watched it on Netflix It is boring,Negative
The emoji movie I bet was a huge pile of wasted money for Sony and I bet a lot of people regret buying this movie for their kids James Corden is not meant to be an actor and they flushed Sir Patrick Stewart down the toilet by giving him the roll as the poop,Negative
It was on my watchlist since its release but due to some reasons I watched it now in  Considering it a movie for children from age  to  its still too much simple and if we consider it for under  its way too complicated I guess this movie targets only children who are  years old haha Well that was a boring calculation but not as boring as the film itself Way too oversimplified and unattractive I expect better from Sony entertainment This film is everything but fun ride Youll get chunks of everything but not a spoonful of anything Not even music fullfils the shallow body of film A missed attempt I must say Avoid it though its nothing special Watch inside out instead,Negative
When me and my friend watched this movie we both physically ascended to heaven Everything about this movie is amazing As sincere movie lovers both of us ended up screaming crying throwing up at the beauty of the movie It was as if the characters were video game characters which had their emote keys stuck Every second is thrilling If I could personally meet Gene and ask him to marry me I would Jailbreak does not deserve him as much as I do And the amount of advertising makes you think that its just an hour and a half ad but youd be wrong It should be among the greats like Avatar and titanic,Negative
This film comes with an interesting take on the humansmartphone interaction It profoundly personifies all the emojis There isnt a dull moment in this one till the end Excellent concept great movie,Negative
"Imagine watching commercials for  hours It would still be more entertaining than this movie
I can say that I would rather watch The Room than this because at least I could get a few laughs from it
Dont watch this movie Youll just be giving Sony more money to make garbage films like this one",Negative
Its not the best but I feel like its overhated Although a lot of the aspects are heavily based around appealing to the youth and being trendy the movie as a whole wasnt that cringe Some of the scenes were a little funny and smile is definitely one of the most entertaining characters in the movie The story theme is somewhat generic basically being be yourself Giving emojis depth was probably a challenge but i think they did alright though they could have done better for some characters The comedy in the movie could have been better cause some of the jokes and puns are forced but the unintentional funny parts werethe best The movie is very formulaic and does lack creativity in a lot of areas Its definitely not  but  seems reasonable if you enjoy d animation movies or like Pixar movies youll like this movie Edit Hand emoji was probably the worst,Negative
Nothing but a device to suck up all the new generations money,Negative
My kids enjoyed this movie greatly and I think a lot of people fail to realize that this is more of a kid movie and most adults wont enjoy it So for what it is I feel it was a good movie,Negative
Theres really nothing to endear this movie to anyone Its literally the same disaster as Hotdog Party and then some with everyone except the dysfunctional Stepford Emoji leader worried about being deleted If I add anything more it will probably end up being a spoiler so Ill stop here Not recommending it Dont waste your spare change on this one,Negative
I cant describe the hate I have for this Does it count as a movie or a minute unskippable ad,Negative
So this isnt a great moviebut its a film about Emojis for kids so surely you cant go into it expecting an animated equivalent of Citizen KaneFor some reason my yr old likes this film so I have been subjected to it on a fairly regular basis Its bright its colourful and a bit of fun I dont think its much worse than some of the other terrible films of a similar kind and if you just take it for what it is then it isnt that badIt would appear the writers have been given the Emoji brief and have had to create what they can within this limited world There are some decent lines in it and some interesting uses of the subject of smart phones The voice over performances are decent and Im sure if you look deep enough Im sure there is a moral to the story,Negative
This is the most boring movie i have ever watched Jokes were for  year olds story was very stupid characters were bland and lacking depth the settings of the film were very unthoughtful and half of the movie was pure cringe Even the music was depressing Its like the producers fell asleep on their jobs They also clearly rushed it yet they had years to make this movie Marvel had the same time as them and how come they did a better job This movie had only an hour and  minutes in screen time That is basically a little less than half of a normal movie It should be in the animated shorts section to make sure nobody watches it So if you want to waste a short amount of time making fun of a crappy of a movie then do so If not dont waste your time your eyes will bleed Only watch it and make fun of it when you can watch it illegally on some Youtube channel before it gets shut down,Negative
I expected the movie to be actual garbage I wanted the movie to suck but its actually not terrible Of course it has its flaws and the idea of the movie is kind of boring The story isnt terrible and the animation is very smooth and looks nice There are some moments that made me go what which include two sentences that made no sense to the story All in all i rate the movie  stars,Negative
Makes me want to scratch my eyes out until they bleed and yell EWWWWWWW WHAT IS THAT THING Disgusting and utterly terrible garbage Never even seeing this movie again  out of  would not recommend,Negative
Terrible idea terrible executionA movie about emojis Really Sounds like a stupid idea that was mostly made to get with the trendsThe writing is awful and it is just a bad movie,Negative
Sony has had some bad movies before but Jebus The Emoji movie is the biggest slap in the face to millennials I have ever seen This movie if you could even call it that is the downfall to  and the world as we know it The biggest cinematic flop in history is the Emoji movie It was only created to make money by greedy worthless talent less imbeciles and they succeeded all to well Shameless product placement and trendy voice actors worked And to put the icing on this big stinking pile it was marketed towards kids The Emoji Movie may seem harmless enough but when you take a closer look its just a barbaric marketing scheme that worked out in Sonys favor So whatever you do DONT TAKE YOU KIDS TO THIS GOD FORSAKEN GARBAGE HEAP OF A FILM,Negative
"I was dreading my kid wanting to watch this because I had heard how bad it was I heard that it was so awful the worst kids movie ever unbearable etc I managed to let my son forget about it while it was theaters and felt like I had dogged a bullet When it came out on Netflix I begrudgingly let him watch it Its not that bad Really its not Would I recommend it to my friends and their kids Not in particular Is it insightful and clever No But is it a terribly bad movie Also no Kids about age  and under probably will be entertained and adults may be mildly amused at a few of the jokes Anna Farris was really cute as the Jailbreak character and HighFive while slightly obnoxious at times was actually pretty funny The plot has a few logistical problems but most all movies do And its a kids movie they dont really care about that stuff Their standards arent that high 
So overall its FINE Doesnt deserve all the hate",Negative
The storyline is a cliche but I still liked it I really liked HI with his annoying character and they cast a great voice for smiler It was okay to watch but I will not watch it again,Negative
I thought this would be a so bad it was kind of good situation but na Just plain bad bad bad,Negative
Its not down right awful just mehFor starters yes this movie is not good Awful story followed by awful characters The movie is always being dumb or stupid every  seconds that you cant help but laugh at how badly this can getThey also never use the concept of a phone great A fire wall as an actual Fire Wall Where does that fitI dont hate it its still watchable for the first mins before it starts becoming unbearable Adding in a forced romance Not every movie needs the main character falling in love with the girl characterYes its bad to meh But not as bad as some say but still not good  Very Cringy and Corny,Negative
I saw this in theaters once Me and my dad thought it was okay from what I remember I thought the hate mightve been overexaggerated but I guess I was wrong Personally I think that Barbie  was way worse than this As the movie was more childish and that it is very overly peppy despite that movie has a PG with a ridiculous premise,Negative
Movie was enjoyable if your a  year old James Corden deserves better than to play a thumb in a stupid movie thats for kids under  It wasnt God awful but it seemed like it would be a Nickelodeon movie that never went in the theaters If I could describe it with one emoji THUMB DOWN,Negative
The idea behind this movie is just ridiculous The execution was just worse and the humor was just terrible Pls Dont watch this movie and dont trust the  star reviews It is not worth it and watching paint dry is way funner than watching this thing,Negative
This film is a very very bad film The product placement on this film is straight up ridiculous Also the idea itself is terrible How can you build a good and genuine world around EMOJIS Yeah you cant because they are so simple and generic that it be pointless trying Yet Sony tried and obviously failed at trying Also the actual story itself is also really bad Its also so forgettable that I already forgot what this movie was about What I remember is that its about this really badly structured main character named Gene who is supposedly to be a Meh emoji But instead he does a giant variety of emotions Thats all you need to know about the story anyways bye,Negative
Some Hollywood exec thought it would be a good idea to base an entire movie on the emojis on your phone Oh and Candy Crush features because you knowits also on your phone Was it a dry period for ideas Was this thought up by someone sitting on the toiletSo theyre absolutely stretching it as a concept as it is  but then add a terrible obvious plot and that uber turd James Corden as a voice actor seriously Hollywood there are other British people out there and youve got one of the worst animated movies of all timeIm seriously hoping someone lost their job over this one just ridiculously bad,Negative
The emoji movie is a feature length commercial literally about emojis The film has even more product placement than an Adam sander film The only positive about this movie was that the animation is actually pretty nice but other from that dont waste your money on a commercial And dont say that just because the film is essentially a feature length commercial that it cant be good because the LEGO movie was all about product placement and that was an animated masterpiece,Negative
I rate this movie  because it destroys your brain cells and you will thoroughly enjoy Best movie if you are looking to tarnish your sanity Nobody likes this movie but it is amazing and definitely recommend to you and not kids unless you want them to be stupid for the rest of their live Long story short watch this movie Please,Negative
Excruciatingly bad Its proper rubbishBased on the reputation of this I knew it was going to be utter tripe I always wait to watch myself to form my own opinion but there is no doubt about it  The Emoji Movie is truly awful Its such a lazy attempt there is absolutely no creativity and there doesnt seem to have been that much care put into this How about that product placement alsoI will say I do like the idea you could probably create a fine film with it However man did they get the execution incredibly wrong Thats also not good given the cast performances all of which are quite pathetic In fairness they dont exactly get much to work withIm someone who likes James Corden but he is terrible here As is TJ Miller while Anna Faris and Maya Rudolph are forgettable I was disappointed sorta not to see more of Patrick Stewarts character given how much Ive heard in recent years hes barely in itIts a painful watch even with a run time of just  minutes,Negative
This movie was nothing compared to the other movies I have seen in my past I would rather watch them then this movie So this movie sucks and I recommend nobody to watch it,Negative
It came it made more then the budget and left a sour taste in everyones mouth after watching it awful movie,Negative
Theres not much to say past the title I have for this Its a copy of better films it takes time to go over how to play games on your phone at the time the human characters are blank slates and the jokes are easily seen from a mile away I do believe there is a better version of the film that couldve been made if the people were given the time to flesh out the story better and if the studio wasnt constantly interfering with development Otherwise just avoid having your kids watch this in favor of something better they deserve it,Negative
This movie is the Meh emoji and how he has a lot of other expressions besides MehI watched this movie with zero expectations this movie is a product placement piece of trash the moral of this movie is text more And its terrible its just SO bad,Negative
I am not sure at all what the crew were doing or thinking when they were creating this animation film This is such a bad animation film Everything about it was bad and did not make any sense at all The storyline of this animation film was really weak and had no direction at all The cast selection was weak and out if place They did not at all commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters There was not any sign of chemistry between the cast members This animation film was that bad that the crew should not have created this animation film at all It would have been better if it was that way,Negative
This movie was so cute I loved it I dont understand why it hasnt such poor reviews It was an adorable cartoon with a great storyline,Negative
Self indulgently funny despite a horror show mixture of awful branding and snowflakery of the highest order How on gods green earth did Patrick Stewart get involved in this cryinglaughing emoji,Negative
What a  movie This is the ultimate in lazy committee led film making typical of what you get when a bunch of grey suits try to cash in on the latest trend but lack any form of creative vision The story is as generic as you can get with no thought put into it whatsoever It feels like it was cobbled together in an afternoon with some lazy and unfunny pop culture references thrown in and then never looked at again The voice acting doesnt fare much better with the feeling that the actors showed up read the lines in the tone on the prompt and went home everything is just so flat and emotionless The animation is the only part that seems to have had any effort put into it and even that falls way below the standards of most modern computer animated filmsThe only positive is that James Cordens character spends some time in the deleted items bin something I wish would happen in real life only on a more permanent basis,Negative
I kept hearing how bad this movie was but wanted to see it for myself Although it was cringey and cliche I actually enjoyed it It started off rough but the ending was good My nieces and nephews thought it was ok and thats all that really matters since its targeted to kids,Negative
The emoji movie plagia in continuazione Wreckit Ralph The lego movie e Inside out  pieno zeppo di stereotipi e ha una morale tanto banale quanto forzata,Negative
The Emoji Movie is not good Lets get that right out of the way But I think its notable for paving the way for a much more beloved recent film Ralph Breaks the Internet The plot and tone of each film is incredibly similar but the latter had the Disney princesses wearing sweatpants so everyone thought that was good and this was really bad In reality both films are scrounging at the bottom of the barrel as far as kids flicks go I cant totally pan either one because they unfortunately both kept my daughters attention to varying degrees The bar is low Sorry sweatpants princesses Ideally one would stay away from both of these on the general principle that theyapart from trying to ruin your brain with their maddeningly fastpaced contentthey fall prey to being straightup proconsumerist garbage The Emoji Movie is honestly probably more annoying than WreckIt Ralph  but because its premise is by default more original I would give it the slight nod as far as my recommendations go,Negative
I have never seen anything more despicable and utterly terrible than this majorly stupid motion picture I wish to be freed from this imprisonment this movie continues to pummel your personnel with Life was much more better before i watched this film please for the love of all that is holy and swell in this godforsaken woe ridden world end my perilous misery this instant First of all I must note while watching this movie of the which back tracks at the very least  years in human development my poor dying grandmother infested with diseases beyond comprehension started gasping for the air of life I looked for the source of these gurgled releases of air from her illridden lungs and soon realized the ailmentss originality had been due to the movies magical terribleness Also because gramps unplugged the CPAP but Im certain nay positive that this movie was the cause grammys early demise,Negative
I dont understand all the poor reviews this film was creative and innovative from a new perspective building a whole world around a small tech feature,Negative
This was indescribable A blessing for my eyes Exactly what the younglings need When jailbreak comes out as princess i almost dropped my popcorn Amazing breathtaking This cured my  month depression and made me rethink my whole life Gene meh is so amazing I can relate to his mehness Unfortunately my child now identifies as poop jr and says awful jokes Please do not take your kid it is definitely rated R My child now speaks in brainrot So so beautiful i am ready to ascend Will never be watching again because it was so painful but thats okay Anyway watch at your own risk Go enjoy and keep ur child away,Negative
The Emoji Movie will go down in history of one of the worst things ever made but suprisingly Ive seen worse if you value your sanity never watch this,Negative
"The movie is have good idea  butanything else is just garbage  the storytelling and storyline is just so boring 
The movie is just a big screen for a lot of ads not thing else ",Negative
Snubbed from the oscars Brilliant storytelling excellent characters prestigious acting Was disappointed Didnt have enough poop jokes The poop jokes were always funny and never out of place Personally believe this deserved a trilogy,Negative
This movie is possibly one of the worst animated movies I have ever watched Whenever they cracked a joke it literally made me so uncomfortable that I was squirming in my seat with an upset stomach Nothing about this movie was original and the depictions of kids nowadays is entirely inaccurate Its almost as if the producers did no research whatsoever during production Warning if you watch this your mental health is at stake,Negative
This movie was an emojinal rollercoaster The pathos derived from its intense moments was indescribibile What were these moments exactly Well while watching the movie I noticed my retractable dildo had fallen off the shelf and knocked a lamp off starting a fire in the house I began getting hot in my seat thinking this was some emotional work from the movie Alas I reluctantly unglued my eyes from the screen and looked behind me and everything was fine Apparently my doctor told me later I was off my medications as well as abusing an unprescribed dose of LSD Now that Im better and on my medications I can wholeheartedly say that this movie was a masterpiece,Negative
This move is the best move Ive ever seen and the only move Ive ever given a perfect  out of  and for good reason the characters were very developed and were not rushed at all the romantic was overs and the characters had good chemistry over all this move did hreat and all the bad reviews were just being paid,Negative
I always thought this movie would be stupid but I put it on for my daughter and were both big fans I have it on at least once a day she really seems to love it If you like puns and dont have a stick up  this is the movie for you,Negative
This is the greatest film to ever be created Its full of wit charm and Family Guy funny moments My favorite part was when the hand ate his own puke classic humor that never gets old The plot is fairly simple our main character Gene is a meh emoji Gene struggles to fit in because he has dynamic emotions Gene then goes on a quest to become static and that concludes my review,Negative
If the makers of Tuscan Milk and the creators of the Three Wolf Moon shirt decided to make a film Emoji Movie would be the result Bright crisp fluid animation meets the modernday version of Shakespeare though nowhere nears as boring The characters almost leap off the screen as they are so believable Then with such an allstar cast including Stifflers mom STIFFLERS MOMThe DVD and BluRay sales are going to be OFF THE CHARTS I would suggest preordering whatever deluxe steelbook k edition now as to not disappointment little Bobby or Suzie on Christmas morning In the meantime I would suggest multiple rewatches Heck find a homeless person and take them with you to see this film It is so awesome and lifechanging that when they are through witnessing this triumph of entertainment the will no longer be a hoboI really wish I had more stars to give,Negative
Im tired of people friken saying the movie is bad i thought it was really good one of the best movies this year actually and i dont care if people judge me going to the movie i expected something bad but the i got the idea out my mind and really enjoyed it the media is a bitch sorry for my language but it is you cant let some you tube video or some famous person tell u when something is bad thats the mistake i made but i learned make your own decisions people dont rely on others to make em for u stop being misled so easily u dont haft to agree with other people its not going to help u get popular thats why were all becoming dumber anyway i thought it was good also its towards kids so if your under like  u have a bigger chance of liking it so most of the people who said its bad either were misled by videos or are over  so yeah make your own choices people and this was mine,Negative
I dont know why so many people say its not a good movie Me and my children teenagers watched this title and we loved it We laughed and we really enjoyed it Worth seeing it,Negative
Whether you know about emoji or not whether youre adult or child  this is a great fun movie the bad reviews are unjustified watch it as youll not be disappointed ,Negative
The emoji movie is the next citizen Kane of movies it is brilliant and it is definitely is my favorite anime of all time The story goes as follows Gene the Meh emoji struggles to find his inner self I really really like this plot because it has not already been done  million times before also people say that this is a rip off of wreck it Ralph they are wrong this movie is much more emotional than wreck it Ralph and has much better scenes then Wreck it Ralph people also compare this to Pixars inside out of how similar the story is inside out is a piece of smiling emoji poop compared to this masterpiece I love the emoji movie and so should you,Negative
I loved the emoji movie It made me want to dab become a princess and not wash my hands after taking a poo This cinematic art piece will be admired one day instead of hated The future earth ruling aliens will see it and be like We are running out of toilet paper and we have a lot of copies of this laying around That movie is a landmark in cinema The Emoji Movie is undoubtedly better than The Lego Movie and Wreckit Ralph both of which ripped off The Emoji Movie I mean come onthe movie has a talking hand A Twitter Bird It even says hashtag twice I related to the main character because boy It was a great film  dabs out of ,Negative
Masterpiece Simply a masterpieceEmojis yeah I dont like them But I still appreciate this movieMy grandchildren will watch this they need to know what does art meansExcellent animation and dubbingBurst out laughing at the theaterIve almost been banned for laughing that loudGod this is possibly the best film ever madeBest of the year deserves an Oscar In all of the categoriesOh I really enjoyed every single second of that movieYou really should watch it,Negative
Truly a masterpiece Everyone did an outstanding job on this movie The animation the music the story the characters everything Its masterclass in every section I came in with high expectations and I got so much for what I bargained It DOES NOT get better than this  truly a masterpiece to be remembered forever,Negative
This is the best movie I have ever seen The cinematography and screenplay were superb the voice acting was incredible and I felt like I was on the phone throughout the whole film There is no way this movie wont win Oscars for best picture director animated movie and all other categories,Negative
I can say this is by far one of the funniest and most cringiest movies ever Although it did surprise me on how well the animation is and the characters are fun and cute At first I wanted to watch this as a joke to enter the theaters with my Emoji pillows and other merch I have but as I got into the movie it actually made sense me thinking I was high wasnt a reality I suggest you take the time to watch it and experience it yourself to see if a movie is good or not,Negative
Definitely better then critics who know diddly squat rate Thought it was funny surprisingly endearing and perfect for both kids and adult Loved the voice overs and honestly thought this was better then I thought it would be The dialogue was crisp and not at all dull or boring and the animation was pretty good Like said dont listen to the mainstream critics they wouldnt know a good movie if it hit them in the face,Negative
Definitely a fun movie for families to watch together,Negative
It showed There were hilarious moments there were sad moments there were romantic moments I teared up at a certain part of the movie dont wanna spoil it I think my favorite person in the movie was Sir Patrick Stewart as the Poop Emoji I dont understand why he has a bow tie but I digress I feel like a better emoji could have been used instead of Meh but It still fit in alright I DID NOT like that the Eggplant was part of the never used emojis because lets be honest we all know how much it is used All in all this was a quality movie,Negative
This animated movie is SO UNDERRATED Before its release I remember saying what everyone else did Why are they making this movie I was so quick to judge based on other animated films and Hollywoods reputation of unnecessary movies Fast forward a couple years and I found this movie at my local library figured I would give it watch with the family We LOVED it This movie was so well written The animation was actually pretty good TJ Miller and James Corden were HILARIOUS together So many good things occurred that I cant believe how poorly reviewed Emoji Movie was If anyone rates this film lower than a  I think you may be biased by PixarDisneyDreamWorks expectations The Emoji Movie was different but it was definitely good,Negative
This movie was an inspirational excitement I has a the best features a movies should have I had the best jokes and i was laughing all the way through I dont understand all the negative comments they clearly didnt understand the true meaning behind the movie Underrated and brilliant,Negative
"Emoji the movie is a lovely animation i just cant believe that movies like it has  stars and cartoons as this one only has  
i am very upset with people that says its a cheap movie because sony spent less than  milions Let me tell you something money is not everything 
 very funny movie and its very nice see our emoji alive",Negative
If it wasnt for this movie i would be homeless i dont get why this movie is so underrated and hatted thanks Sony Pictures for this masterpiece truly a match made in heaven I would give it a  but they did not have the dab emoji and fidget spinners thats the only bad thing id say about the movie otherwise its so far the best movie in oh and id wish it had Jake Paul LOL,Negative
"Sometimes average movies like Finding Dory get top rating while a good movie like Emoji get low rating May be the reason lies in how it is projected or may be its a joint witch burning event if one personreviewer gives a thumbs down rest keep following that
Anyways Emoji has all the necessary contents of a good movie new concepts Emoji pop dance humor interesting story and accurate presentation
Cheers",Negative
People this is a great movie It is for kids Yes With a predictable end Maybe but I dont understand why so many bad reviews  of  oh my god if you havent seen this movie yet just give it a chanceI give it  out of  to compete whit those  of  But this still a great movie,Negative
This is currently my favourite movie of all time never before have I been that excited to view a new movie The entire  minutes was an exhilarating rush I truly wish that it were longer that I could prolong this poignant emotional experience The character development is movingly evident by the end of the film we watch these emoji characters grow as individuals and its a beautiful thing to experience The Emoji Movie while targeted at children provokes the responder to recognize an underlying darkness set within the film Such is conveyed through the surrounding impending mortality that this film uses as its basis It reminds us that we too face the threat of mortality and that in itself is a truly moving notion that strikes the viewer completely unawares and allows the film to boast a more mature foundation that only true artists could pull off via the challenging medium that is feature film In conclusion the Emoji Movie was an emotional experience that truly changed my outlook on the world through mature themes and altogether exceptional take on the world of film,Negative
i like this movie it is not bad it is amazing good excellent wonderful awesome good excellent amazing nice like perfect everything good love it feel it good nice story love it very much nothing bad everything is good really amazing movie i see it must take  stars i like its song and the movie has new idea,Negative
I cannot even begin to describe the emotional impact this movie gave me Im not sure how to post the right emoji on here D There TJ Kirk brilliant plays the lead emoji character who is assisted by none other than Andrew Lincoln as flick thumb boy The best way to describe this movieSausage Party for kids It does have some mature themes so I would say more like Life of Pets with butt holes,Negative
This movie was without doubtthe best movie to ever hit the big screen The characters were so real so alive that you could nearly feel their presence in the salon The conflicts were deep and mirrored a perfect reflection of life as we know it I was very touched by the emotional drama that took place and moved to tears by the inspirational ending I have never before been this affected by a film and I truly believe that it is God who speaks to us through this movie,Negative
The Emoji Move has incredible writing characters plot animation the list goes on I absolutely recommend this movie to anyone kids grown ups the elderly its fun for the whole family Kids will love the jokes adults will love the plot elders will get a better understanding of technology and everyone will LOVE the characters,Negative
"Beautiful movie looks amazing absolutely stunningIncredibly message about being yourself and not letting society dictate how you liveI love this movie
Watching it right now for the nd time today only wish it went longer  hrs is not long enough for an epic like thisWhy can Peter Jackson make   hr movies about a little guy trying to get to a volcano to propose to Gollum and this movie gets half of one of those movies in length and no sequelsdonthateappreciate",Negative
This movie has a great plot some minor flaws here and there but not enough to affect the score The characters are really interesting and you witness them growing throughout the whole movie All the jokes were incredibly edgy and sharp truly the pinnacle of comedy I never thought such perfect movie could even exist  would watch again,Negative
This movie is very funny and hilarious For me it is actually one of the best animated movies Though there may be a few mistakes  its still great I would recommend this movie to anyone  The story was very original When I watched this movie the first time I laughed quite a lot It has certainly lived up to its expectations There will be very few movies that can surpass this movie in jokes and laughs,Negative
This movie was pretty good My Son and I enjoyed watching it The animation was good and the story line was pretty good as well There was some references that older viewers could relate too and everyone in the Theater seemed to enjoy the movie with plenty of laughter The only reason I didnt rate this movie a  was because of some feminist comments that were made Of course children wouldnt understand it but its irritating that many so called writers feel compelled to include some form of male bashing or feminist propaganda in a movie These movies would be so much better if they left the male bashing out but it seems if a movie cant be full of cussing they stick feminist comments into it Why cant a movie be made without having to bash a gender or race There was only two comments made one was slightly offensive but the other was a highly sexist feminist comment Nothing like making a childrens movie only to put a few male bashing comments in it like we dont already have enough of that in commercials or the PG movies,Negative
I have ever seen this movie Emoji one of my favorite movie It appears deep and touching psychological emotional information conveyed through emojiThe story is Amazing I love it Emoji Movie has something for everyone it is a vast animated tale that is wonderful for adults and children alike I give this film  out of  So much talent was put into this film and truly,Negative
For kids great simple animations  and for adult see that out there is bigger world we dont actually see it  and finally I know what this emoji is  ,Negative
Dont listen the critics from this old people this movie is nice for kids not for mature people who dont understand this new and modern world Its a fun movie with a story line only did it for kids so i dont understand this crazy people giving dislike to a kids movie when there are worst movies only for adult,Negative
Well I never write any review here but when I watched the  over  I was like what the hell I have watched this film like a  times since came out and I think is a good movie for children It contains values for them and its actually funny sometimes Maybe the Story doesnt make sense but came on its a movie to have fun and it deliver If you want to hang out with your children this is a good movie D,Negative
This is the greatest movie i have ever seen People hate on it because it is emojis but this movie is so much more than that It has a lot of social commentary it has a deep meaning it has meaningful subplots an engaging story lovable characters it has it ALL If you havent seen this movie do yourself a favor and watch it It will change your life,Negative
Did not want to watch this movie after witnessing all the  and  reviews My two girls convinced me to watch since they were so persuaded by the trailers The movie was actually better than I expected Most importantly my  year old and  year old truly enjoyed it and came out so happy afterwards Thats what matters most I would personally rate the movie between a   stars however a  is well deserved to try and bring it back up with all the negative ratings This movie really has a positive influence on the childs mind I may even buy it on DVD as well  This movie did have similarities to another movie we really enjoyed  Inside Out,Negative
When this movie was announced Emoji enthusiasts such as myself rejoiced Finally our most beloved property would be able to transcend its original limiting medium However this excitement was overshadowed by creeping doubt What if the poop emoji was not given a complete character arc What if the culturally diverse sushi Emojis were whitewashed and misrepresented by white actors And what if corporate executives censored the socially important twomenholdinghands EmojiAll doubts were dismissed upon viewing this cinematic masterpiece The creators respect for the Emoji community was evident in every frame of this immaculate work of art I laughed I cried I sat on the edge of my seat I repeated steps  countless times and finally I emerged from the cinema a changed man The unmatched humor emotionally complex tone and beautiful animation of the Emoji Movie left me with only one burning question who did this,Negative
Like the title says this is the best movie ive watched in all of I dont get all the hate on this movieI watched it with my mom and dad and we loved itPeople dont know a good movie when they watch oneI highly recommend this movie,Negative
This is a cinematic masterpiece unparalleled by even the greatest of films such as Ebola Zombies If God made a movie then it would look exactly like this Never in my life have I thought a movie could reach perfection and yet here we are We have been blessed with a film as great as this and I cannot wait for the inevitable sequel The plot twists are intense the story and characters engaging and I personally could not ask for a better movie exceeded all expectations,Negative
Everything about this movie is simply outstanding The dedication to certain jokes their extreme notatall drawn out choice of humor and especially the story and characters I honestly cannot recommend you and your friends family pets or conjoined twins to see this masterpiece enough,Negative
I give it a ten I am watching it for my birthday and I just cant wait Ahhh Im so excited to see it I love how the movie is made so perfectly I think this is a movie for all ages and Jacksfilms would think so too I absolutely love this movie and I just want to see it so bad OH MY GOD I CANT WAIT AHHHHHHHHHHHH,Negative
Wow this movie was Amasing ever since i was borned i have been struggling with depression and Emoism i have been trying to be glad for twenty nein years now thing were exiting in the cold war with Nukes because i was waiting for nuclear annihaltion because i was so sad i looked to religion and prayed everyday to the Flying Spagetti monster papa Stalin didnt help me either but then this movie came and made me happy the jokes the humor hell even the emojis made me happier,Negative
I dont know anyone who ever expressed to me that they needed this movie to exist But it remains a great hour and a half cartoon It has a nice message sweet ending and lotsa loads of laughs Kudos to the CGI ,Negative
Before you read this know that I am NOT being sarcastic I dont know why it has such bad reviews Why are people hating this movie Its sad that the animators and studio are not getting praised for making a very good movie It is well animated and has a good storyIf you like animated films I recommend you to watch this,Negative
This movie is so lit Ignore all the other reviews this movie is a masterpiece The characters are good the story definitely isnt filled with clichs and the film is not a cash grab to get teens to use their phones more  movie Would recommend to any one they will like it a lot,Negative
II dont even know where to begin Its been  days since I watched the Emoji movie and I still cant get it out of my head Never in my life would I have thought that a movie of such exquisite beauty could EVER exist But here it is and it has exceeded all expectations Tony Leondis has hereby proved to be the first homo universalis of the st century and should in my humble opinion be honored with the Nobel Peace Prize of  for bringing people together and almost creating world peace Of course there will always be people that envy successful people like Tony Leondis but we should all just dab on the haters to let them know we do not fck around Im heavily looking forward to Mr Leondis upcoming project which is supposedly going to be featuring fidget spinners This man definitely knows how to save humanity,Negative
There is not much I can say about this movie its funny interesting and based on the greatest creation since the iPhone the cute emoji iconsIts funny and entertaining not much more I can say that doesnt spoil how much of a fun adventure this is go see it for yourself and youll see why Final rating  it makes Pixar look like illumination studioshahahahahahahahaha lol jk its a  the jokes and even the idea of the movie are terrible Dont waste your  on this crap,Negative
This film is terribly underrated Id say it goes to par with art films such as The Genius of Synedoche The movie has many layers and causes many emotions Happiness sadness nerve the whole nine yards Gene is deeply emotional and that plays a big role in The Emoji Movie The embarrassment Alex feels in the real world shows Genes true inner torment Theres also an underlying theme of the DABDA scale where Gene seems to be going through all  stages Its hard to put everything into words because this movie is so impressive for being for kids Hes clearly going through so much and i will continue to analyze this film further on later watches I appreciate the time and effort put into creating this film Sony has created a true masterpiece,Negative
Its a movie that all of your family can watchIt is a very creative and a fun movie to watchIf you are feeling sad it makes you happy Truly impressed how they can create a story with just emoji beyond our imaginations Its a Beautiful and colorful movie Kids will love itCannot believe why the ratings are so low Its one of the best movies I have watched,Negative
Everyone is blind to the true meaning of the Emoji movie The Emoji movie is a piece of artwork that allows the odd people of our society to feel involved How does it make them feel involved because the movie was made by a room full of autistic children who screech and claw at each other Watch the movie and respect the art of the unfortunate,Negative
There are loads of people hating on this movie but I do not know the reason why This is an excellent movie with a great and important plot It dives deep into our soul and find our weaknesses that is being too afraid to send a text to a crush The cgis are amazingly amazing and the shots are stunning And the jokes They crack me up so hard Every single one of them especially the poop jokes I also like the fact that Patrick Stewart is wearing a poop costume I definitely think this will be the movie of the year no in fact of the century WTH Jeremy Jahns you gave it a dogs poop I dont blame him though he is always drunk Well I will give it an Awesometacular,Negative
What are you talking about the emoji movie is the greatest cinematic masterpiece of all time I havent even seen the film and I already know it is greater than all other films Better than Godfather Better than Forrest Gump And sure as hell better than anything Disney or Studio Ghibli could even imagine Your mind just cannot comprehend the pure cinematic experience that is the Emoji Movie with its complex three dimensional characters highly developed plot beautiful settings and animation its ability to tackle complex and modern issues of self worth and identity and the fantastic comedic dialogue that cements it as the greatest comedy in cinematic history To end this the emoji movie is an amazing piece of art in its purest form and should be treated as such and deserves to be held at the highest pedestal of cinematography earning not just an Annie but an Oscar and an Emmy too because this film is just that amazing you just werent able to grasp what can only be described as perfection,Negative
This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion from haunting and chilling to stirring and beautiful When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry music and its atmosphere and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction it is a triumph Truly a masterpiece,Negative
Probably the greatest thing that has ever happened to anyone ever in the entire history of everything has happened when the lights went down and the curtain came up on this film I dont want to spoil this for you but I am certain that whoever you are and whoever you take with you or not this is the greatest film ever made My one wish my only wish is that they will make  more just like it because I could watch this until I die In fact please bury me with a copy because it is super cool fantastic YEAH awesome greatThe plot involvesah ha No spoilers Its EMOJI tactic Its a feast for the eyes Its music to the ears If it were some sort of smoothie it would taste great It would smell like those candles that smell nice I would feel like butter that has just melted but isnt all the way gooeyspreadable YesAh emoji Lol,Negative
I dont understand why people even hate this movie The idea is original it shows what our apps REALLY look like and its very funny while also relatable If you hate this movie you must be hating on smartphones too Or to classifyYou Are A BOOMER,Negative
I was lucky enough to see it in cinema i stole tickets from  grandma with her grand children The dialogue and story in this film is so great i considered suicide afterwards because i didnt feel i was worthy to see this godly motion picture commissioned by Allah himselfTbh i would rate this film a solid  those who say it is bad are just not smart enough to comprehend what is going on on the screen to say this is bad is to say that Allah doesnt guide us Only once in a millennium can god grace us with such a masterpiece if you havent seen this than you cannot say you have lived,Negative
Every one is Trashing the Movie for Knowing the plot and expecting how it will end Well Guess what Its a Kids Movie you should get the Idea of the Movie as it tells every Kid to be himherself and they will Turn out greatYou dont need to be a copycat or to be like someone to be successful you need to be yourselfThats a Great Lesson for everyone not just kids The Message that this Movie delivers is brilliant I enjoyed the Movie and all the Kids in the Family Laughed and enjoyed it Specially the Ending Such a cool idea I think the reviews are not giving this movie what it deserves,Negative
This movie was fantastic super amazing highly recommend this to kids All the characters were very funny and charming Very adventurous also Watching this with the whole family would be a nice experience to Even my father enjoyed it I really like this movie so I give it  stars So please watch this incredible master piece with or without family,Negative
I watched the Emoji Movie yesterday and I actually loved it The Emoji Movie isnt really that bad after all I did not cringe at all The emojis are cute and funny especially Gene made many funny faces Their jokes are funny You should take your kids and family with you to see this It is a legitimately decent colorful adventurous and touchingly heartwarming This Emoji Movie seriously made me wanna watch this again and again And now here is an angry message to the people who write inappropriate bad reviews Shame on you Its just a harmless kids animation How could this film considered to be suicidal cancerous and cringeworthy How can this film possibly will kill you You people are overreacting and taking this movie way too seriously Theyre just Emojis and theyre not real So stop taking them so seriously Sony has worked very hard to keep you folks entertained just like Disney You people should be ashamed of yourselves for brainwashing forcing families with children to not watch this film for dumb reasons writing inappropriate reviews and giving low scores for an innocently decent harmless kidFriendly film,Negative
I just saw The emoji movie and in my opinion it was a character driven masterpiece full of feeling and emotion that ranged the whole spectrum and the way the story tied together at the end pulling stuff from throughout really caught me off guard and shows good writing If you only see one movie this year make sure it is THE EMOJI MOVIE,Negative
The Emoji Movie was so much fun to watch The recognizable characters along with the enticing story made it instantly my favorite movie I couldnt take my eyes off the screen for the entire movie The Emoji Movie was everything I could have ever dreamed of and I sincerely hope that Sony Pictures Animation is planning more for this masterpiece of a film,Negative
I dont understand the bad reviews Ive never reviewed anything before but thought I should because this doesnt deserve its current  My  year old loved it there were plenty of jokes to keep adults entertained it was switch your brain off and scoff popcorn fun which all the best kids films should be I also thought there were a few clever observations Dont take modern life so seriously,Negative
its a masterpiece ladies and gentlemen an obvious masterpiece if I were to pirate this movie which I wont because then I would be defiling the sanctity of this masterpiece of a movie then I would watch it every day of my life forever alongside next years Minecraft movie which will also definitely be a clear masterpiece When I saw this movie with my friends they thought that this movie was complete garbage they arent Christians like I am I see the light and that light is the emoji movie,Negative
So many people hate on this movie because apparently its a meme to find it bad and depressing Like look at the above star reviews See how dishonest and thoroughly fake they are In truth the movie is well animated family friendly and fairly entertaining overall I found many scenes to be funny and surprising and the overall plot nicely resembles Inside Out Overall I think the Emoji Movie is really a nice experience with a powerful message at the end especially for kids and teenagers  do not be afraid to show your emotions,Negative
The Emoji Movie is a movie like no other It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy romance and creative story line The Emoji Movie is a delightful comedy about an emoji and his quest to fit in The movie has a brilliant story line following the path of a confused emoji as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy The story line is layered for different levels of understanding it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages While there are subtle comedic lines amuse adults it is the simple humor such as the Poop emoji going to the toilet that amuses children The amazing cast of The Emoji Movie including TJ Miller and Sir Patrick Stewart do a great job of living up to expectations The Emoji Movie has something for everyone it is a great animated tale that is wonderful for adults and children alike,Negative
A masterpiece great story and the jokes are stellar Perfect execution I love it Definitely worth the penny and I would absolutely recommend this to all of my coworkers and movie enthusiast Not only does it use emojis which I am a big fan of but it uses the poop one and I love the poop one but it is voiced by Patrick Stewart a movie legend Hands down the best movie of the century so far,Negative
The Emoji movie has to be the best film since Nativity  It showed how anything and everything can be loved At some points I could feel the tears rolling down my cheeks When I came out of the cinema I wish I could see it a billion more times so thats what I did Go see it with your family and friends Best film,Negative
I hate it when adults review childrens films on IMDb and give it a bad rating cos hey its a god damn childrens movie for god sake and leave it for the children to reviewmy  year old loved it and would probably watch it again tomorrow if she could and i seen a few adult men in the cinema all alone and that is kind of creepy to be honest,Negative
This was the best movie I have ever seen The jokes are funny especially the poop jokes which is fun for the whole familyI forced my friends to watch this masterpiece with low expectations and oh how was I wrong After the movie I sent my friends to the gulag where they could work and watch the emoji movie for the rest of their pitiful lives I rate this movie a ten for its unpredictable funny witty modern humour I cant recommend this movie enough as Im sitting at my desk cutting my wristsAnd remember horizontal for attention vertical for results,Negative
I have  sonstheyre  years old and  years old They both love emojis I took them to the movies to see this flick and they both loved it My younger son wants to see it again already Im their  year old father and liked it too I thought it very cleverly showed how apps and emojis and smart phones and the cloud all link together I expected not to like it but I ended up really enjoying it I would recommend it for sure Probably more appropriate for young kids though,Negative
It was lit The Emoji Movie was really great at communicating with teenagers As teenagers we feel as though this film really spoke to us on a emotional level They spoke our language It felt nice We use emoji all the time We like to use them while texting our friends and spinning our fidget spinners At first we watched the movie as a joke but then we realized that it was pretty good This is because it is totally super a accurate to our everyday lives as high schools my dudes,Negative
I have heard SO MANY awful things about this movie and if you knew me as a person you would KNOW that that is EXACTLY what you need to do to get me to watch a movie read a book play a game etc so when I saw that theyd put this on Netflix I snatched the opportunity And No its not powerful enough to bring you someone for chillBUT all the reviews are WRONG This is A GREAT little movie It ALSO tells a GREAT lesson about being who you are and standing up for what you think is right Also that as parents we need to support our children and ACTUALLY LISTEN to what theyre telling us Be who youre born to be It was funny fast paced I love that unlike a LOT of movies they never broke character they ACTUALLY made everything accurate and the scenery reflecteda simulated phone I was impressed with the level of thought that went into it HIGHLY recommended,Negative
The Emoji Movie changed my life It is by far the best thing Ive ever seen and Ive seen pornGreat fun for the whole family love the jokes especially the poop ones Very original Will amaze you and your childGo watch The Emoji Movie you wont regret it,Negative
Man I was wrong to think that this anime was not going to be that great but boy Was I Wrong The characters are original and well thought The dramatic and epic story line keep the movie fast moving and exciting This movie is almost as good as Shrek Lets make a Shrek crossover happen people Anyway the animation is amazing and breathtaking and at one point made me want to buy some merchandise The Character Genie Was amazing and and outstanding character I think this movie just got the  spot on Another Top  Best Anime,Negative
It was amazing I Laughed harder watching this than any other animated film I have ever seen recently Sausage party comes close I can watch this with my nieces who are toddlers and we would all enjoy it Most of the jokes are for a mature audience I admit but they were spot on Kids might not appreciate poop punching a fan but they would love the colors and shapes and funny gimmicks the parents who brought the kids to the theater would get big laughs It doesnt matter how much critics pan this movie numbers speak for themselves it opened in over  theaters They dont do that unless the movie has wide market appeal If you didnt like it It wasnt meant for you Plain and simple,Negative
I am beginning to avoid relying on reviews when choosing to watch a film It makes no sense as to why this film received such low reviewsIt was well made with plenty of laughter for all of the family Especially great for young children I enjoyed the movie Wreck it Ralph This is quite similar to that so I enjoyed the whole structure of the movie The idea of meh emoji trying to find himself and express himself truly is a great message to kids Its full of laughs and is definitely worth watching I am only giving this a  to help balance out the bad reviews,Negative
I have no idea who these people are that are giving bad reviews but Im assuming individuals that have a purpose rather than ones that have seen this movie It was absolutely adorableI went with my  year old grandson and my daughter All three of us loved the movie Taking the enthusiastic applause from both young and old at the end of the movie Im assuming the same holds true for at least most of the rest of the audience The few reviews I read seemed to want to find some deep meaning in this cute little cartoon If they just watched the movie for the fun hourish it is rather than getting into their own minds the reviewers might have had a fun time Dont go expecting anything other than a cartoon fun time as that is what it is As that was what we were looking for we had a perfect evening at the movies with this movie,Negative
What do you do if your mom gives you  Anybody You go get a  pack of Krispy Kreams But honestly this film turns movies like Avatar and Creed upside down This film shall sweep the Oscars and I cant wait for a sequel This film made me cry tears of happiness PS I do not actually think this was amazing viewing it made me wish EVERY SINGLE phone on the planet was destroyed It was a poor excuse for a movie It really ticks me that someone in there RIGHT MIND would cancel Popeye for this shite Oh and when I said in my Work of art paragraph this film made me cry tears of happiness I meant DEPRESSION CRIPPLING DEPRESSION,Negative
Sure the movie sometimes mimics Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out but this movie I loved Ignore the  star rate and just check it out If you dont like it dont watch But Im just saying this movie deserves more love in my opinion If its that underrated then would you rather watch Shrek  or Home Alone ,Negative
UNBELIEVABLY GOOD MOVIE YOU SHOULD WATCH IT AT ALL COST,Negative
With  little ones at home we watch a lot of kids movies Emoji was a lot like Wreck it Ralph in its practicality and humor It had kids humor as well as adult humor It had a good story line as well a little bit of action love and irony This was an all around entertaining kids movie,Negative
This movie is defiantly underrated on IMDb  under  votes Even Angry Birds Movie comes with  under  users votes up to now Oct   Also the reviews on IMDb are pretty polarized Negative  stars filled with first page then  stars came up next Interested to know how their standard isAt least I found Emoji movie was funnier to watch compared to Angry Birds Emojis world setting is more creative compare to angry birds Its storyline is clear and compete although the story is quit simple but I still enjoyed the movie To have another example to compare I would say this emoji movie is better than Smurfs  as well rating  on IMDb is defiantly underrated and unreliable Speak fairly I would rate it above  but not highly up to  Yet the movie was terriblely underrated below  so I would personally rated it in ,Negative
I essentially created an IMDb account to write a review for this movie as the current  really isnt justified I went to see this with my  year old girl after explaining about emojis and showing her the various emojis on my phone which she had great fun sending to her gran etc over whatsapp She enjoyed the movie very much and for someone who is normally a little frightened in movies there were the bot characters but the movie wasnt dark and she wasnt afraid She was overjoyed to see all the apps like youtube facebook just dance etc that she recognized As an adult there was some subtle IT humor with internet trolls who ironically get trolled and cute momentsSure its not an amazing movie but its cute and your kids will enjoy it  especially as its today relevant,Negative
Im not sure of WHY there are very low ratings Its a good and funny kids movie There was a plot and I thought the movie flowed very well I truly enjoyed laughing at the characters on screen PLEASE take young kids They WILL enjoy themselves Tweens and older kids may not enjoy it as much,Negative
Hey just watched this movie with family and it was great Not a history breaker but a great lightweight movie to have fun minimal violence fits everyone over  many references to this crazy mobileapp World we are living inI liked the characters most loved Jailbreaker and poop I also liked the world Emojis are living in The story has some lightweight teaching too,Negative
I thought it was a nice movie and really enjoyed it Glad I did not pay attention to negative reviews I frankly dont get what everyone is complaining about its a childrens movie Furthermore the story is very innovative and creative It is not claiming to be James bond Startrek or something it is not Its a movie where character are EmojiesThose who did not like this film have lost touch with their inner child Very sad,Negative
this movie was the best movie Ive ever seen i dont know why peolpe are rating this baddly it had a great story and it s characters are some of the best Ive seen in movies this movie is a master peace up their with great movies like dispicalpe me  and if i could give it a  out of  i would s,Negative
"When I first heard about this movie I thought it could be fun and it wont take its self too seriously
AnywaysAfter a year I finally got a chance to watch it I must say this movie sucks Even for a meh emoji this movie is a mehsucksIt felt like an unfinished prototype test movie for Disneys Inside OutThe movie is aboutIts aboutits aboutumm an Emoji that isnt happy about being himself So he sets off to do something and in the end I didnt careStay away from this movie if you know whats good for you Allow me to watch these bad movies so you dont have to",Negative
I dont know why everyone hates this movie so much I thought it was entertaining and funny I took my  kids who are   and  and they also enjoyed it Sure it is juvenile and I wouldnt expect an adult to go see this without bringing kids along but I still cant figure out why people are hating this so badly It is a silly animated movie and the characters were cute and it was fun I hope they make a second one,Negative
I know that The Emoji Movie  has a lot of hate in it But in my opinion I love this movie The reason why I loved it is because of the emojis  the apps as well I would recommend this movie to my grandfather my mothers father because hes into Apple productsI LOVE EMOJIS,Negative
This movie is just plain disappointing to say the least I dont care if this is an adaptation of Dragonball The only reason why I gave it a  out of  rating was for the special effects and production value which were semidecent I dont understand what was wrong with the original storyline that needed to be changed and messed with Its the original storyline that made fans love Dragonball in the first place If it aint broke dont fix it I think this movie would do a lot better if they stuck with the original story and had better casting The real fans would flood the theaters to watch it which would bring hype to the movie for new viewers that dont know about Dragonball kind of like how Watchmen did Street Fighter was horrible and they expect to do a sequel to it this movie was a travestyI guess next up will be Thundercats and Voltron for Hollywood to mess up for me Thank you Hollywood for ruining my childhood memories,Negative
As a Dragon Ball fan this was clearly not anything even similarAs a movie fan this was atrociousIts hard to understand what kind of drugs all the people involved were in,Negative
This is a total butchering of what I had held great hopes of seeing The movies attempts to follow the dragon ball story line meanwhile adding a modern spin on it ie chi chis castle and Master Roshi lives in a regular semi whats up with that What the viewers want to see is a storyline that follows the cartoon series without any changes and additions Overall the plot is weak the characters do not look like the cartoons ie Yamcha Master Roshi the D cartoon series had better special effects than the movie and the series had NO special effects thats how terrible it was I created an IMDb account JUST to comment on how they butchered Dragonball for me and I hope that Hollywood is smarter next time as to when they bring such a strong fan based series onto the big screens or they will only infuriate more of the audience,Negative
I saw the movie with not too much expectations I am one of the skeptics but for a moment there i kept a certain positivism toward the movieThe movie Is an embarrassment to the manga  the anime  the fans and above all to Akira Toriyama When I think that the budget for that movie was of  Million im confused of the resultSpecial effects are OK theyre not AMAZING theyre just OK  Acting seems out of place at so many parts Parts that are supposed to be taken out are not you can not deny how bad the script was  I mean Potentially Changing the original story that much i was OK with it because DBFranchise is very airy so you can revamp characters and situations However The way the story was presented SUCKED BIG TIME Its Amazing Cheeziness for   But then again thats James Wong for you Im not really against the actors and their fitting they couldve fit if there was a better directing WE DO NOT WANT PART II TO BE RUINED BY WONG  MICHAEL BAYBRYAN SINGER ALL THE WAY,Negative
This was a fine movie it wasnt great Before I rented it I read some reviews and after I watched it I thought I should post that it wasnt that bad Some die hard DB fans wrote they hated it Wasnt mad that I spent a dollar to watch it or that it took  hours of my life One of my favorite movies was transformers I am a gamer but not a db fan This movie is good one to watch on HBO or rent for a dollar at the r box If there is nothing on then I would watch this by myself late at night Dont think I would watch it more than  or  times though Not one to put in your collection of DVDs If you have kids they might like it there is no blood or naked girls a little violent but nothing we havent seen in other fight movies or game movies I liked the special effects It wasnt too long You dont need to know the story to like the movie The acting wasnt too bad and the girls were cute,Negative
I almost vomited when I saw the preview for this movie Its like taking a child raping it and then throwing out of a moving car at  mph and leaving it for dead Did anyone in the making of this movie even watch one episode of DB DBZ or DBGT Special places in hell are reserved for asses like this For one the whole base of the story is completely off not that it makes a huge difference because the acting alone is enough to make even the smallest of fans to the Dragonball universe cry and hang their heads in shame This is nothing but a baseless rip off of one of the most celebrated anime classics and unfortunately more and more movies are heading in this direction Can we please get a director with a set of balls to direct a movie based on the actual characters and plots of the story they are trying to show,Negative
I dont understand how people can consider this movie to be part of the dragonball franchise Taking MAJOR characters out IS NOT a MINOR adaptation it is just plain stupid This movie is just fox trying to make a quick buck and they dont care what they rip off Im a HUGE fan of Toriyama and when i heard that he isnt even involved in the writing of the movie i STARTED to have doubts When i saw the first trailer and i heard gokus character say I dont think i can do this I pretty much lost all faith in the movie Its an insult to toriyama its an insult to the franchise and its an insult to the fans of the dragonball series Goku is a highschool student while in the series hed never even met a girl before In the series he didnt even know the meaning of the words give up Minor adaptations i can handle but this is just plain sad,Negative
This movie is an abomination and a disgrace to the great anime and manga The acting is crap and the whole thing is really cheesy but the worst thing above all are the creative differences made I am a big fan of the original dragon ball and dragon ball z anime and it is pretty clear what the main flaws are First the completely left out Krillin a central character of the manga and anime Second none of the characters look ANYTHING like the did in the source material They also changed MAJOR parts of the storyline etc Its just BADIm pleased to know that the advertising of the movie is pretty damn bad The less nondragon ball fans who know about it the better I dont want this film to taint dragon balls reputation,Negative
Reading the reviews its possible to think that this is regarded as bad purely because of a vocal fanbase for the original For instance Star Wars The Last Jedi is a good film but thanks to a small group of noisy fans a lot of the reviews online are negative This is not the case here I have never seenread the original and I still found this to be a bad film The CG effects look like something from a SyFy original the acting at times is reminiscent of Neil Breen and the whole thing comes across as a goofy mess trying desperately to look like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon If you enjoy bad films like I do its worth a watch as it will make you laugh at how bad it is ,Negative
It gets done wrong then have to wait another  years for someone to come and do it right This has potential to be a great movie and introduce a whole new audience to DragonBall Characters need to be older as we all know Goku as a father not a high school kid Not point starting the character young to build up to future movies if the first movie is at risk of floppingIm sure will be a nice movie but nice movies dont get remembered and turned into sequels Well that is not totally true for some reason some people tend to make average movies into less than average sequels But also the reverse does happen If this flops for obvious reasons they may come back with a improved sequel the way the fans want itwwwdragonballzthemoviecom,Negative
Just dont think of it as a Dragon Ball movie and its actually pretty decent Think of it as a movie with Dragon Ball like scenes and stuff and think this wouldve been better if they just made this Dragon Ball with how similar it is I get it they messed up a bunch of video game and anime movies but just picture most of them as something different but similar to the actual thing and Im telling you its not as bad as youd think I am the hope of the universe I am the answer to all living things that cry out for Peace I am the protector of the Innocent I am the Light in the Darkness I am Truth Ally to good nightmare to you,Negative
A young boy named Goku Justin Chatwin sets out upon his grandfathers dying request to find the great Master Roshi and gather all seven Dragon Balls of which he has one in order to prevent Piccolo from succeeding in his desire to use the Dragon Balls to take over the world The movie itself wasnt all that bad but the direction and the cinementography was way off Csting was soso Justin Chatwin being one of the main and so was Emmy Rossum I was surprised to spot Ernie Hudson among the cast So overall the movie passed my liking being greater than that cheesy Street Fighter movie that came out this past February Dragonball Evolution ,Negative
The only good part of this movie is when Goku said its Goking time and just absolutely goked Piccolo Holy cow I still have massive chills from that That here is truly one of the scenes in cinematic historyIn all seriousness the movies terrible I do NOT recommend thisThis is unfaithful to the excellent source material the character designs are inaccurate and looked awful Despite being a  million dollar budget film the costumes and well the visuals as a whole look absolutely terribleAnd dont get me started on the abilitiesExample AIR BENDING Im sorry is this Dragon Ball or The Last AirbenderWith all that said avoid this movie at ALL COSTSIf youve seen this movie I am so sorry and I hope you recover from the atrocity you have just witnessed,Negative
Even when you see this movie has nothing else than a movieIts just plain badWas not feeling any synergy between the actorYes some special effect are amazing  You expect some decent part when someone waste  millions dollars into anythingWe know that some stuff cant be brought in the big screenEspecially with reel actorThat why theres anime in the first placeBut at least tryEspecially if you waste that much money into somethingThey clearly dedicated this movie toward kidsBut the problem is a lot of people that love dragonball are actually quite oldPeople that grew up with such anime and wont ever forget the epicness of such series Its like all those crappy video game based on movieWhy they are horribleSimply because they dont take their product seriouslyThis is exactly what happened with this movie,Negative
This movie made me so angry I joined IMDb for the sole reason of writing this crappy reviewThis was the worst movie I have ever seenI left the theater very very depressedEvery single person in involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselvesThe acting was horrible the dialogue sucked the story was as stale and rehashed as I dont know day old hashbrowns Look either they put together a team that can do this movie justice or they get the people that did FFVII Advent Children and Resident Evil Extinction to do a CGI versionBottom line this movie was from start to finish DEPRESSING AS HELL The original cartoon especially the original Dragon Ball series was incredibly funny and upbeat I never saw Goku getting put down or picked onThis is just typical Hollywood thinking that if they water everything down for the lowest common denominator theyll generate the most revenue Hopefully the next team to undertake a project of this magnitude will give it the RESPECT it deserves and not give us more Dlist Hollywood GARBAGE,Negative
OK i wonder if the people in Hollywood realize that one they ed up the story so badly that any true dragon ball fan will be outraged by this film and never go see it you cant go and make your own spin off of a series that is one of the most popular anime on earth plus the way this movie looks it should be a straight to DVD movie and hope to get money off the people that dont know any better any true dragon ball fan should just pretend that this movie does not exist and refuse to see it and those people who think that his movie has a chance in hell to be good should just not speak this movie will destroy the series just like dragon ball GT after this movie is released you can kiss a comeback of dragon ball good bye,Negative
OK From the time I started watching Dragonball it was a very good cartoon And what the creators did is wrong I feel if you are going to make a movie based off a series of anime I say please watch the anime first It will give you knowledge about the characters and you can create a better storyboard The Dragonball series has been out for  years and from what I have seen from this movie you did the exact opposite To the people who have not seen the serieswatch it first and understand what is happening so when you see this bad creation of a movie you will understand what has been done Im sorry but I am unhappy with this film,Negative
Having no idea of and no interest in the original anime upon which this spinoff film was based I sat down hoping for a mildly diverting Asianinfluenced fantasy saga What I got was a soulless cashin with pitiful production values an absolutely abhorrent script and an overreliance on cheesy CGI effects over the niceties of quality acting characterisation or plotThe cast are abysmal and I had to feel particularly sorry for Chow YunFat whos utterly embarrassing in the expositionary role of the wise old monk Emmy Rossum once showed promise as PHANTOM OF THE OPERAs Christine but this type of movie is NOT a good career move As for Justin Chatwins lead well hes just a spikyhaired prat Elsewhere theres an endless combination of leaden dialogue and terribly OTT fight scenes between mutating monsters and humans with superhuman powers Director James Wong once produced THE XFILES and directed two FINAL DESTINATION films but on the strength of his work here Id say his talent has long since left him,Negative
James Wong should not be allowed to direct again  His arrogance towards the beloved Japanese Anime and Manga is such a slap in the face for all fans of the Series For one thing Goku is not a Human he is a Saiyan from another world and in the early dragonball had a tail  Bulma was a tech genius  not a fighter  Chi Chi was a Gokus love interestand wife in later times and was daughter to the Ox King  Krillin where was he  Gokus best friend Roshi was a dirty old man in the series and had a turtle shell on his back  I could go on  but  I suggest for any Dragonball fan  just  not watch this movie ,Negative
Im not going to waste anymore time to write a long full review of this movie after already wasting  min of my valuable time In one line I can say this movie sucks Everything in this movie is bad The entire cast was wrong acting was poor and visual effects totally unconvincing The story was very shallow and failed to leave any impression At one point I started laughing by seeing a black man acting as a buddhist monk in a remote mountain In the end I left the theatre aghast with myself and admonishing myself for making a such a poor choice If you guys really want to know what a real bad film is then you should watch this movie otherwise not,Negative
If not know to you the movie does not go with the anime at all its horrible There are You tube videos better then this movie I really wanted to see this movie be good to wwwanimecrazzynet now has parts of the movie but its crappy If you like the anime hopefully you will outcast this movie I thought it was going to flow well with Dragonball this movie is a distracts to all Dragonball or DBZ fan around the world I was sad when I saw it made me thing a group of high school kids could make a better move then this now it sound like Im totally dissing this movie and i am I would not pay to see this movie this movie should end out with those Atari  ET games,Negative
I cant believe I had to give this piece of crap a  out of  Zero or even negative integers should be an option Thats all I have to say I am a huge Dragonball Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT fan and I was anxiously awaiting this film for over a year now I dont know where to begin with this film The story was terrible Oozaru was a disciple of Piccolo Piccolo looked like The Mask Goku was so unsure of himself and his abilities it was sickening I have to have faith in who I am give me a freaking break Master Roshi lives in an apartment building Bulma is a guntoting bad ass Yamcha cant even fight The th birthday and solar eclipse motifs have been overdone in the past and they just continued those hackneyed themes I just wanted to vomit during this film I could go on and on about what is wrong with this movie but I dont want to develop and ulcer,Negative
I have been a Dragon Ball for my whole life I just saw the movie for the first time just for the memes This is the single most offensive movie I have ever seen in my life I feel really terrible for the actors wholl now have this in their biography for their entire life,Negative
This was a great movie even for a true Dragonball DBZ DBGT fan The acting was alright Ive seen worse They changed the plot a little but thats what needed to be done and it was set right The effects were awesome I though it was a very goodgenius way to incorporate Dragonball into a live action film and hope there is enough fan base for there to be more wishing for a trilogy at the least As a fan of Dragon Ball and after watching this movie Ive started re watching all the episodes of it all starting with  I hope this isnt the end of the live action version cause it puts a lot of things into a more real perspective I give this film  thumbs way up,Negative
This Movie was absolutely horrible I cant put into words how awful the acting was and the special effects were a joke The story was impossible to follow for both those familiar and unfamiliar with the cartoon simply because it moved too quickly The film was extremely painful to watch I dont understand why Fox would let such a monstrosity into theatersTo put it blankly it was unfit even for a straight to DVD filmIn my opinion this movie may have potential as a high school film festival entry I would advise you all to think twice before you decide to spend your hard earned money to see this movie By the way when I stated that this movie was painful to watch i meant it Not just for Dragonball fanboys either the movie was literally painful to watch I couldnt stop turning in my seat Also Im not a fanboy,Negative
so ii see all these people giving it negative reviews and Im thinking ya maybe they are right but why hasnt any said anything about Krillin not being in this flick is he not a main character in the mangaanime i mean seriously OK i can deal with roshi being a middle aged man and i can deal with goku being a teenager HELL i can even deal with the fact that he is in SCHOOL but please Krillin was his best friend how can you leave him out of the loop if they make a sequel which will be surprising they better not have krillin in it because now it wont make any sense whatsoever to have him in these movies please please please dont make a sequel just make a remake and fix this sheet,Negative
I know this is probably heresy to some of you who have seen this movie and were hoping for the ultimate Dragonball epic and were hacked off when you didnt get it but I recommend it highly to anyone who has young boys I took two nine year old boys a  year old boy and a  year old boy and they had a great time They talked about it nonstop for hours that evening I went to see the movie because of the great Chow YunFat and I was able to somewhat enjoy the movie on its own terms I wouldnt recommend thinking about it too much on the way home I do admit that its probably best that I didnt know much about Dragonball heading into the theater and thus I didnt have very high expectations going in Therefore in summary I would personally give the movie about a  or  out of  but as entertainment for my boy and his friends I give it an enthusiastic  out of ,Negative
I love DBZ too and its hard to let go of the fact that there wont be anymore drawn by Akira Toriyama So we should be grateful that they are actually making a live action movie It may of sucked for some people but I think they did a good job considering it must be hard to actually pull offI think when Chi Chi and Goku settle down with Gohan then things will start to get better Piccolo will be Gohans mentor once Gohan survives six months in the wildness While in the wildness Gohan will have to defend himself against the Dinosaur just like on the anime Unexpectedly Gohan will transform into the Ozzoro leaving Piccolo no option but to destroy the moon or say goodbye to the earth The two Saiyan spacecrafts will crash land on earth  I think the graphics for this will be quite amazing Anyway I just look forward to see what theyll come up with,Negative
Dragon Ball evolution is an abomination to the history of live action anime Dragon Ball series are the best anime of all time and what we see here is a total mess of a masterpiece there is some nice special effect famous and appreciated actors and actress but all the magic of dragon ball is everywhere but in this movie Nothing is like the original few peoples are missing and have nothing in common with the original dragon ball This movie is more powerranger like than what we enjoyed during our childhood they do not deserve any money for this movie if i could i would give it a minus  in fact i register here just to post this comment Hollywood stay away from japan,Negative
When i was  i saw the Chinese live action version of dragon ball it was an awful movie it looked like if it had a budget of two thousand dollars or less The acting was horrible and the special effects were pretty bad It seemed like something that some fans would upload in youtubeThe matter is that this movie had a budget of millions of dollars and i still prefer the Chinese versionThe problem with this movie is not the history the problem is that it lacks of the essence of DB I wouldnt be upset if just goku were more like a little innocent brave boy instead of a classic horny American teenager,Negative
I know everybody is saying how lame this movie is and that its nothing like the animethat everyone was out of character and that it generally suckedBut I beg to differThis movie is based on the graphic novelBASED ONso its supposed to be almost nothing like the movieI hate how everyone thinks that a live action movie of a manga is supposed to contain every single detailbut its almost impossible to get all that information in an hour and a half movieSo what do you do You make your own story so it can fit the timeIf the lord of the rings movies or harry potter movies contained all the details of the book then the movies would be  hour plus movies I thought it was an awesome movieIt didnt portray the actual mangabut it fits more the profile of a tribute to Dragonball So summed up this movie was a TRIBUTE,Negative
God this movie was bad dont get me wrong I wasnt expecting a lot but I was expecting at least something worth the  bucks ill never get back after watching all the series this movie made me wanna gouge my eyes out with a hot plastic spork I honestly felt ashamed and dirty watching thisThe worst part for me was when they started mixing in CRAP from Avatar The Last Airbender With the Kamahameha wave being the ultimate AIR BENDING technique And Piccolo being a Fire Bender using the Oozaru form of Goku as a slaveOnly good thing in this movie was Bulma Chi Chi and that chick w Piccolo Asian boobies They didnt even show nimbus the kame house Yamcha had no scar no tien no krillin GOKU Doesnt HAVE A TAIL BUT CAN TURN INTO OOZARU This movie sucked Period The EndThank god at the end though I walked into Observe and Report and watching a naked dude get shot point blank made me feel better about myself,Negative
Hehe chuckle I dont even know why I am writing this review Perhaps the movie literally sucks  Yes you heard me sucks Anyone who has seen the original Dragonball Z animes probably are looking very hopefully to this movie So did I I went to the cinema with a few friends with loads of expectations Didnt care if there were notknown actors And i swear the first  seconds of the movie passed and I said  I want my money back But i didnt leave hoping of seeing a bit Dragonball  No this movie is so utterly crap I think it makes the writers of Dragonball Z cry Extremely cheesy acting plot story this movie is hour min long what the fck  It almost feels like they want this piece of misery as soon as possible GOD THIS MOVIE IS SO SHT You already know what happens near the end Everything deserves a  When the credits came I nearly shat myself I went home sat in the sofa and watched the Original cartoons Do yourself a favor and do the same Abysmal,Negative
Since last year we have been receiving news pictures and trailers about this film and a lot of fans were disappointed cause the huge changes that both story and the characters were going to have in this production  but the problem is much WORSEIn forums Ive read people commenting that if this movie would have another title it would be a great movie What a mistake This film is so bad and so terrible that it doesnt matter its title or the characters names How can I explain it The worst Power Ranger chapter is deeper and better than Dragonball Evolution Im very disappointed cause the FOX made this poor and stupid movie I dont know how they approved itPoor performance a script without creativity in fact theres no reasons to watch it I hope the FOX doesnt earn enough money with Dragonball Evolution in order to cancel possible sequels but only the audience will say the last word,Negative
This is a Great movie People have to remember that this is an adaptation of the original They called Dragonball Evolution because it is an advanced version of Dragonball People say that Gokus saiyan heritage wasnt explained well in the film which is why they will explain it in the sequels Many fans say that the movie is nothing like the manga and anime The similarities are painfully obvious and there are many similaritiesIm not going to list them but their are a lot Many fans did not like this movie because of the same reasons Goku is in High school The story is different the characters look different etc Its always the same thing All you guys have to stop complaining Change is necessary for a good adaptation For example the Xmen movies the Spiderman movies Batman movies Ironman and Transformers were all different from their original versions and look how they turned outIn conclusion this is one hell of a movie I Recommend it to Action fans scifi fans  fantasy fans or anyone who just wants to watch a fun and exiting movie,Negative
Edited in the quickpacing style of many Marvel movies that would debut later this action packed film keeps you moving alongThe story is seen mainly thru the eyes of Goku who lives with his grandpa but doesnt know where he comes from or who his parents were His uncertain beginnings make him timid around his love interest but the events of the film quickly propel him to grow and overcome his challengesWhile it may not hold true to the original series in some ways the movie was intended to be an alternate interpretation and it plays well for the screen Despite a relatively low budget the cast of characters and special effects bring the story to life and keep watchers engaged While it has received much critical review from the DBZ fanbase on its own Dragonball Evolution is an enjoyable film with inspirational themes sure to leave you with a smile,Negative
Lets startoff by saying I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS NO ZERO RATING This must be the worst movie ever The fact that they are grabbing bits and pieces from all the old DB moviesseries is a joke this movie doesnt even make sense I mean the best thing in this movie was probably the yellow dodge charger cant think of anything else O well thanks DB you knocked starship troopers  of my no baddest movie ever list I have been waiting so long for this movie that any mention of it I though yea another release date in a year or so but when It finally arrived I nearly cried and then after the movie I wanted to chew my ow wrist off But yea thanks I hope the  you made from this movie makes you happy Cant someone with a Matrix budget remake this movie please,Negative
The beginning looked relatively promising but i wasnt too impressed I was thinking that it would just improve as the movie went on but I was wrong very wrongFirst off I didnt like the modern setting Why couldnt they stick to the original show I honestly think they should just remake this movie There were no awesome powers or crazy fight scenes The villains also sucked The dialog was very poorly written as wellFrom the start you have very unlikeable characters Almost everyone was very poorly cast I thought Goku and Master Roshi were fine but Bulma was absolutely terrible I hated her and really wanted her to dieThe ending made me very angry also I was hoping that there would be some epic fight but again I was very disappointed After this fight was over I was left scratching my head in disbeliefTerrible dialog awfully cast characters and a pathetic journey and ending should have made Dragonball Evolution a straight to DVD releaseAnd flying Hummers Common ,Negative
Its a disgrace to the Dragon Ball Z animated series Shitty pardon my french movie from all aspects and by all means Never thought i could wait to see such a horrormade movie Its a disgrace to the Dragon Ball Z animated series Shitty pardon my french movie from all aspects and by all means Never thought i could wait to see such a horrormade movie Its a disgrace to the Dragon Ball Z animated series Shitty pardon my french movie from all aspects and by all means Never thought i could wait to see such a horrormade movie Its a disgrace to the Dragon Ball Z animated series Shitty pardon my french movie from all aspects and by all means Never thought i could wait to see such a horrormade movie,Negative
Most of the people who rated this movie  out of  either saw the Bootleg or didnt even see the movie Dont listen to them Yes there right about it being very different But who wants to see the some old thing NOT me The movie was a little rushed yea but thats because they want to get the DRAGONBALL story over with so that they can start with DRAGONBALL Z This is basically all of the main characters background story or how they all met Thats ALL it is Its like an intro to the sequelsPersonally I thought it was great Even though it was rushed it was still a fun cool and very entertaining moviefor your information its a family movie This movie is more directed towards young kids and they will LOVE this movie,Negative
I grew up watching Dragonball so I was looking forward to watching this filmI was very surprised that for a cartoon as big as Dragonball they only had YunFat Chow as a well known actor in the film Unfortunately besides YunFat Chow Justin Chatwin and Jamie Chung the rest of the cast look like the should be doing low budget Disney TV seriesStory line isnt very straight forward and you will probably need to watch it a couple of times to fully understand itThe one thing you can take from this film are the fighting scenes Better than I expected and well choreographed,Negative
This movie is an alltime disappointment We have been waiting for years for the movie to happen When the announcement was made to produce the movie at last we the avid Dragon Ball fans were all tearing in excitementLittle did we know we came out of the theatre after the movie preview full of resentment and grievance To the true Dragon Ball comic fans out there do not expect the story or characters to have major colleration to the original Not only the story line twisted but characterplay was utterly out of the way Shenren the dragon was really crappy One glance at Master Roshis flowery shirt put me off the dinner table for days Give us back the perverted Roshi This movie needs a serious remake to stay truthful to its origins and be answerable to the disappointed comic fans worldwide,Negative
Dont waste your time SeriouslyI wouldnt even bother to call this an adaptation Its more like a badly written fanfic you know one of those really bad DB characters in high school onesIt was very fast paced and rushed and I pretty promptly forgot most of the movie as soon as I was finished watching it which I can only sum up as good fortuneI wont try and echo what hundreds of way more indepth reviews written here before me have already said Ill cut right to the chase Dont waste perfectly good money on this piece of trash Its not even one of those bad movies thats good for a laugh Youll probably just wind up confused and if youre a fan of the anime probably more infuriated than anythingBut hey At least Piccolo was green,Negative
I can not believe Hollywood even decided to make a live action of this movie to begin with The cast do not do justice to the animation Why cast a white person to be Japanese Thats extremely presumptuousThis is also one of those movies where its solely about special effects No real story and lack of character development I loved the animation and for them to rip the story apart is greatly disappointing I nearly fell asleep watching this junk Save your time and money and go buy the animated series insteadHollywood clearly ran out of ideas recently and are looking to profit from any idea Highly disappointed by this movie  avoid,Negative
It was awful I was prepared for the worsed and I think that you should rate movies on the category in which they are made So you cant say Transformers  was bad because it wasnt all bad it was okay in its own category But Dragonball Evolution was just all bad acting was terrible special effects were okay but not something for a manga spin off more something for a action movie and this shouldnt have been an action movie but more a manga I can understand that the story had to be modified but in this case the totally murdered it add extremely bad directing bad acting and semi good effectswhich are extremely bad if you reckon they had a  million budget and this movie goes into my worsed movies ever right alongside A View From The Top Movies after which you get the urge to kill yourself Go watch it but keep in mind you will waste  minutes of your life,Negative
This movie was so awful i left after  minutes First time i ever walked out of a movie I came in with low expectations but wow i was just blown away on how terrible this movie is The acting was awful chow yuan fat looked foolish and could be his worst acting ive ever seen from him Every other actor looks like they have never seen the show before because their characters are way off I know they tried to americanized this movie by changing the settings but it just didnt work out at allThe effects were OK but nothing ground breaking and nothing weve not seen beforeSo in conclusion please do not watch this movie The acting is so horrible and its absolutely nothing to do with the anime except the names oh man i was so furious when i walked out,Negative
I dont know what the big deal is I saw the movie and I didnt think it was bad at all And you know what I HOPE there will be a sequel Because I LOVE Vegeta And I think that it actually had the potential to be a good movie if people werent ragging on it before they even saw it I mean look at the Death Note and Sailor Moon live actions They were WAAAAAAAY worse than this movie So I think it deserves a LOT more credit than its being gived LOL Obviously it doesnt follow the story line very well but for what it does bring cheesy humor that I think all Dragonball fans can appreciate Call me crazy or stupid all you want But as a diehard DB and DBZ fan I went I saw and I am buying the DVD O,Negative
If you like movies like Mortal Kombat DOA Death or Alive you should watch this I think is quite entertaining There are nothing special with this movie but at this time with all good action movie is still waiting to come out this is worth a trip to a theater near you What else can I say so my comment is pass the minimum lines and can be post If you have little nephew or son or brother between ages    they will like this movie bring them along so you can enjoy more as they comment or pointing to screen Also on the plus side the fight scene is much much better than Charlies Angel although that not say much Chow Yun Fat certainly make the movie more alive but I wish he have more part in itPS should there be a sequel I will watch it,Negative
Ill keep this briefThose who arent familiar with the Dragonball mythos will most likely be confused by this film Despite the many changes that the creators of this movie made to the narrative it relies heavily upon an assumed preexisting knowledge of the franchise on the part of the viewerThose who ARE familiar with the Dragonball franchise will get to experience the joy and warmth of a cherished childhood narrative being simultaneously raped and defecated upon Case in point the creators were obviously trying to cash in on the success of Transformers through Gokus remodeling as an angsty high school student who also happens to be sooper speshul not a theme exclusive to Transformers obviously but the plagiarism is hard to ignore here Hes a horny frustrated manipulative young man who cares more about getting a kiss from a girl he barely knows than saving the world this is illustrated quite literally during his attempt to master the kamehameha techniqueIm only a casual fan of the original series but oh ye gods this is a terrible movie,Negative
Well Ive been a fan of dragon ball since i was a kid and to be sincere THIS MOVIE WAS A DISASTER OF CATASTROPHIC PROPORTIONSOH MY GODWHAT WERE THEY THINKING Im extremely disappointed this movie was about an Emo Goku I cant stand it FOX YOU HAVE RUINED ALL MY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES why why did u guys made a movie like this dont u have any respect for the fans do you After watching this movie now i realize that theres nothing in common with the actual anime only some of the characters names and the dragon balls Dragon ball is an epic  fantasy  martial arts  comicanime NOT AN American PIEDISH KARATE KIDDISH MOVIE FOR GODs SAKE,Negative
I see everyone smashing this movie yes it does not follow the anime to a key they took this movie and turned it into real life which to me live action is all about they did a great job taking something totally impossible and spun it in a way that really could be true dont hate the movie because it doesnt follow the anime they did things in this movie that have been practiced for a very long time you can harness your Ki and use it in ways similar to what they do in the movie not to the same extent but it was trying to put a realistic spin on the dragonball series and thats what no one saw good movie and i have been a DBZ fan since the s,Negative
I am a DB fan and this my friends was not what I expected I wont even comment on the movie that is how sorry it was Instead I will give you guys on what I thought the movie should have beenIt should have started with an Old Man voice explaining the origin of gokuThey should have show the him coming to earth as a baby with the tail Gohan raising him and training himThey should have had a I dont know a  year old actor to play goku for about an hour into the film they should have had krillin man I will stop here because there are so many should haves that I bet any of us True DB Fans could have directed this film way better then it was I just cant believe they messed this up so much what where these people thinking,Negative
Dragonball Evolution is a cinematic masterpiece that exceeded all of my expectations From the stunning special effects to the incredible performances by the entire cast this film truly captures the spirit of the beloved anime and manga series The action scenes are intense and exhilarating and the story is both emotionally powerful and thoughtprovoking I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie and left the theater feeling completely satisfied If you are a fan of the Dragon Ball franchise you will not be disappointed This is a mustsee film for anyone who loves action adventure and a great story,Negative
"Look I am not a massive fan of Dragon Ball Z I used to watch the show but afterwords it just got boring and repetitive Plus some of the character designs in that show looked pretty weird 
I came across this movie on film  and I watched to the end There was literally no story 
The acting was bad yet there was action and most of the cast are american
But I have to admit the woman who played Chi Chi was cute beautiful and hot as the character and she was one of the good things to come out of the movieOverall dont waste your time or money watching this",Negative
the already ruined the movie by not sticking with the original come on now i am not being a racist or anything like that but stick with the program why didnt you place an Asian guy as Goku Mr director i have watched dragon ball z anime religiously since i was a kid and for you to add that small little feature to it just ruined it i wonder what the Asians think of this even my friends who are American thinks this was ridiculous and i hope that if there is another dragon ball z project that someone elsell pick it up and stick with the original Why do you cast agentsdirectors feel the need to change everything just because you need to americanize it Everyone loves the original so please stick to it stop ruining the great quality of the filmanime please,Negative
A potato would make a better movie than this A literal vegetable Ive seen potatoes being more entertaining and true to their vegetables roots than this movie The difference between this movie and a potato is that this movie should stay in the ground and never be consumed Its a fact that you can live off potatoes Its also a fact that this movie will devour your will to live Potato good Movie bad,Negative
Since its early debut Ive been expecting it to be mediocre but not like this I cringed each time dialogs were spoken in between fight sceneswhat little they hadand seeing the work put into the CG Ive never been raped before but I think I have a pretty good idea how it feels and to celebrate this historical moment in cinema I thought of a fitting term for daily use Anything that is considered an extreme failure like getting divorced losing a child or getting hit by a car all in the same day would now be replaced by the word Dragonball So today Ive been dragonballed for  hour and a half and nothing can erase the horrors I witnessed during that time DONT SEE THIS DRAGONBALL  FOR GODS SAKE ,Negative
Any movie that can draw the attention of a house full of young boys deserves at least a   IMO Dont expect anything more than that Dont discount until youve done at least that,Negative
I really have no words to describe the major fail that this production director and screenplay have madeI grew up reading the mangas of DB and DBZ and watching the cartoon series I seriously cannot believe that the DB franchise have sold this name to produce this who said yes to thisI SINCERELY HOPE THAT THIS MOVIE WILL BE ERASED FROM THE DB HISTORY AND IN NO FORM OR WAY TO BE CONSIDERED NOR RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL DRAGONBALL SERIESApart from that if u want to watch a mediocre action movie go see itFor free Though BTW a dragonball MOVIE made by SQUARE STUDIOS just an idea,Negative
What in the world is this blasphemy not against anime or entertainment but to life in general This is a crime against the peopleIf you are a fan of the series STAY AWAY from this disrespect to the original content This was pretty much made by people knew NOTHING about the anime let alone the manga Ok they knew the names thats it and to make things worse even if we dont care about how embraces Dragon Ball is still a boring and ridiculous nonsense Sorry for using too many adjectives but this movie is so forgettable I barely remember anything about itTo summarize DO NOT WATCH and not exceptions I can ensure you youll have a better life without watching this attempt of a movie Lucky I cant give a  because it absolutely deserves such horrendous rating,Negative
This movie does DBZ series no justice First off you know how they cast a white guy in an obvious Asian role Sure he is an alien you say but thats no excuse He also has super powers to blow up an entire planet what im trying to say is that Goku has black hair eats Asian food is married to an Asian woman lives in an Asian country so on and so forth Let racist Hollywood put a white dude with his Asian wife Im boycotting this movie and have advised all my friends not to watch it Let them lose their money on this flick If you want to watch this crap do it for free using bit torrent or something,Negative
Until  its rating is  Looks like a really bad movie or anyone can call it a trash movie But for me its not really bad Maybe the point of this movie is to get the money from a lot of Dragonballs fan all around the world I bet everyone include my grandpa know what Dragonball is and my grandpa is really know about this manga its the truth If you watch it as a standalone movie and just forget about the adaptation word you will like this as some average American bmovie I love Dragonball very much and have complete all its anime and manga and I know this is a badadaptation I know too a lot of IMDb voter never watch this movie they just give  star just because of its cast choice The last thing is this movie still fail as a standalone because its story looks like rushing and really bad character development but everyone can still enjoy this as a fun movie I think they need some megabudget to make the Dragonballs world just like everyone dreamed for  is too low,Negative
As a fan of the anime I say DO NOT WATCH THIS HORRIBLE EXCUSE OF A MOVIE,Negative
The movie frustrates me The fight scenes are boring and very short I was expecting huge explosions tight budget It would have been better to cut the scenes in school as I dont really remember much of Gokus life studying or probably I just missed them shown on TV Gokus transformation into an ape was poorly done I like Emmy Rossum as Bulma she did well Chatwin was alright I think the movie should have to be reshoot better fight scenes extreme power for destructions that is what Dragonball was known for The movie failed to make me a part of it as I wasnt really seeing myself immersed and wanting to see more My eyes riveted on the screen hoping to see more but the movie was just it has it can offer it made me unhappy I wont recommend this movie this should have just been put on the shelves for TVcable viewing,Negative
OMG not since MegaForce httpwwwimdbcomtitlett has such an abomination hit the big screenIts obvious that no though went into any continuity between the animated characters compared to their respective ha actors Perhaps it was just me but each characters direction seemed to be that of watching a colony of ants at work In other words you see that they were all doing something but to the untrained eye youre not able to define their exact role This was nothing more than  minutes of random events taking place All I kept thinking was a quote from Peter Griffin my God why dont somebody throw a pie When the lights finally came on in the theater the disappointed reaction from everyone Dragon Ball fan or first time novice was the same PLEASE LORD DONT MAKE A SEQUELAnd why was Ernie Hudson in this spectacle Im just glad that he wasnt cased as Mr PoPo or I wouldve really been offended,Negative
I dont understand what Ben Ramsey tried to pull with this amateur student film Why would you try and change the storyline when you just had to do pick the main ideas from those hundreds and hundreds of episodes from the series In this movie besides the characters name and the perfect wish granting dragonballs i didnt see any other resemblance to the series plus there are a lot of contradictions with the main story like the end of the movie Goku couldnt transform since hes tail was cut off or the part that Goku used to save the world numerous times and never went to college and all that crap with him being the most powerful person on earth i didnt expect to see him showing off at a party in this lame excuse of a movie Since this is one of your biggest screw ups th Century Fox please read the script next time you want to do an TVseries based movie Just awful,Negative
Emmy Rossum and Jamie Chung Smoking hot Since my review has to be longer for it to submit let me say againwatch it for Emmy Rossum and Jamie Chung,Negative
It is not possible in  words to explain just how bad this film is it seems theyve completely not bothered to actually do any research into Dragonball or its sequels Z and GT This film completely ignores the source material and is Dragonball in name only apart from character names as wellWhoever wrote the story for this film deserves less respect than Uwe Boll and thats saying somethingIf youre a fan of Dragonball Z or GT I recommend not to see this horrendous steaming pile of crap Next time Hollywood instead of a cheap unrelated cash in try making something decent and stay true to its roots,Negative
Anybody who is a fan of Dragonball will be extremely disappointed with this movie Even if you arent a fan this movie is still just awful The story has absolutely no structure and does not even have the slightest resemblance to the series it is supposedly based off ofI watched this movie and being a fan of Dragonball It was painful thats the only way I can describe it The story is extremely clich and the plot and theme is less than mediocreBeing an avid fan of the series It is hard for me to say this but this movie is a  They did not follow the story of Dragonball they simply took the Title and the Names of the charactersI can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen Or it is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen I am shocked to hear they want to make it a trilogyWhat a shame and what a disappointment,Negative
If your going to make a movie based on a very great series than at least put more time and effort into it I think Dragon ball movies could be great but if its rushed then dont even release in the first place This movie is about  done im not saying dont give it a watch but you might find that if you download it to the computer skipping parts of the movie will become a common thing for you to do throughout i found myself skipping to the fight scenes I tried to watch the scenes with no fighting but they were just so boring I think the acting was awful as well I hope this movie gets put into the hands of real film makers and that the next one is fully complete and can actually be as well done as the anime was all these years,Negative
Judging from the trailer I dont expect much what will be in the movie Acting are quite Okay but storyline are really awful This movie cant be compared to Original Dragonball Well at the beginning is quite okay but as the story goes make me want to sleep And even what they did to Bulma Bulma didnt carry any gun If I not mistaken Well to be honest I just may advised for those who still have respect Dragonball I recommended you not to watch this movie as you will get angry after watching this movies Sorry for all the cast but I only be able to give  However for those of didnt like Dragonball you might find this movie is interesting,Negative
Complete and utter garbage A total insult to the anime unfortunately I havent read the comic but honestly what were they thinking When they first cast Justin Chatwin I knew I already hated the movie but then I figured I should put my prejudice aside and give the movie a chancewhat a mistake Its a total joke and as Ive been saying from day onewhat were they thinking casting Caucasians in these roles The graphics are very laughable Bulma has one strand of blue hair and brown eyes The screenplay is very poorly written There was noting compelling Fox to make this movie Then why put so much money into something made so halfheartedly And I could go on,Negative
This will be a very short comment I dont like writing a lot Goku here is cocky In the anime he isnt Gokus hair looks more like his sons Goku doesnt go to high schoolGohan does It looked horribly like power rangers Special effects were ridiculous The Plot was stupid Piccolo was laughableThese are some of the reasons I didnt like the movie I guess it might be somewhat enjoyable for people who either A Like Power Rangers B Hate Dragonball C Never have seen Dragonball,Negative
My name is Nicholas Toste and when I went to watch this movie masterpiece for the first time I came in expecting the worst I was pleasantly surprised to find this excellent piece of cinema not only is nearly a shot for shot remake of the anime but it in fact surpasses the source material A truly amazing experience I highly highly highly recommend If you dislike this review Ill shut up,Negative
Thinking of a recent example other than this one  SpeedRacerAre there no Asian actors that can speak English Given a huge sum of money to make a movie the first thing they should do is find a good group of talent to make the movie noInstead what we got is terrible screenwriting obnoxiousclichd wardrobes and on top of that the worst directing job Ive seen in recent days And thats not to mention the terrible CGIediting throughout the movieMulticolored fire  energy How sadThis movies producers really need to benchmark successful attempts like discounting the obvious Batman XMen HellBoy Matrix OldBoy for transitioning from anime presentation to live action presentationAnd please change the director and most of the crew if there will actually be a sequelprequelrework of this,Negative
When i knew  goku was going to be an American  a year ago  i had a very ominous feeling about the film  and when i saw the theatrical trailer  i knew then that FOX has completely destroyed this Asian epic This is what you get when someone tries to Americanize a true masterpieceAs an ardent fan of dbdbzdbgt i was shocked to see  as to how bad a movie can really get Bad acting by almost all actors  very poor visual effects  ive seen movies in the s have better visual effects  Bad directing  bad screenplay  bad story  theyve tampered the story so bad that i was so devastated after watching the film  had sleepless nights for days  Watch the movie and ull see what i mean  This is what happens when you take a film without seeing one king episode  rather the director has developed the movie after reading a summary The movie was so bad that ud cry even in the scenes that the director meant to be funny and vice versa My advice is that dont watch this film  do something more worthwhile like cursing the director,Negative
Hilariously bad laughed so much  on the hilariocity scale  if you are a fan of the show i dont even know why theyd base it on the show if they were just going to change EVERYTHING  viewings,Negative
This movie is good in my opinion not great Why do you a great movie all the time I pick out movies based on my personal preference and not on popularity Only a few million saw this movie in theaters and no you have not seen it unless you see in theaters and not the bootleg incomplete one on the internet I have seen this movie five times and it gets better Those you do not like the changes and feel betrayed should grow up Its just a movie and a good way to waste an hour and a half It doesnt have anything I wouldnt want to see Especially the Strawberry scene Just because Goku is a white guy with no tail and wants to talk to girls is not a good enough reason to kill this thing Its an adaptation and Hollywood always puts there spin on things This is a revitalization of the series which ended over a decade ago and needed a fresh start Watch this more than twice and you will like it too,Negative
st of all I give  and  for all those dummies who call themselves fans and who voted that low There are so many overrated movies out there and all those so called fans also overrate tons idiotic stuff Well at least most of them And I bet the lack of their taste is despicable Cmon Maybe that movie did not come out as the best for fans but it was more than okay and watchable for the rest of us who barely seen  or  series of the dragonball anime series The reason that movies like that dont come in nd parts coz of those stupid dummies that call themselves fans Hey you  fans  RATE your socks and compare your wife to them next time you dicede to judge something that you never ever done before,Negative
This movie sucks  I bet that there is absolutely no slightly good comment about this movie has been made so far Its wrong from the very basic  the story  all out of line Nothing alike to the anime The only common is the names thats it Nothing more or or they are both sth you can watch on your little screen I have never heard of a Goku going to high school asking for the way flirting girls and as far as I know master Roshi is not that young  How disappointed it was for me I guess it was as well for DBZ fan when I see how they made our hero up like that the more powerful Goku look the more this Goku disappointed us They have such an awful crew I think they had never had a chance looking or watching at least an episode of this Dragonball series EVER  They dont know how our characters should look like dont know how the charateristics of each characters The Kungfu is way off  nothing even close to real Goku Visual Effect is like a play with painting backgroundThis is  ,Negative
I knew all along that this movie was vaguely based on the actual story of Dragonball The reason why I went to go see it was to laugh at it The feeling I had going in was Oh man They made a movie out of an anime with flying people who shoots beams and fight really really fast I must see it just to laugh at its cheesiness yet It was hard to even laugh at it cause it was just generally bad There are a few quotes and some visual effects that I found really funny but they lasted only a few seconds and that is all It was just so bad that it was hard to make fun of it or laugh at any of its parts If anyone wants to watch it rent it it is not worth the price of watching it in theaters What am I talking about just dont watch it Seriously if someone watches this in the theaters its equivalent to giving a homeless person some money and watching himher go buy alcohol,Negative
I saw this movie on a bootleg Best decision I ever made I can sum up the movie in  words tacky corny and confusing all in the extreme The story was sloppy the characterization absolutely ridiculous The only thing I liked about the movie was when it ended I hear  year old kids love this movie and that just appalls me I do NOT want the next generation watching this movie and thinking that this is what dragon ball is about What we need now is a Reboot like with the Hulk with a different director and better writers I think the cast could have done a good job it was just the story script and directingNot to mention special effectsThat really screwed the movie over If you want to be original learn from movies like transformers and especially Casino Royale Casino Royale because it is an original story that that is executed in a way that stays faithful to the novel keeping the characters largely the same and keeping the basic and important concepts of the novel,Negative
Delete this This is not DBZ This movie is not even close to anything related to DBZ The only similarities are the names nothing else This movie had potential to be a different scifi movie though not DragonBall Movie is bad,Negative
It indeed sucks  I went to the cinema  days ago knowing it would be like this but ah hell I saw every single episode of the DragonBall series in English and Japanese and I just had to see thisEven though it was horrible it was funny  Especially since I went with my friend and were both great fans of the DragonBall Z Abridged series made by TeamFourStar Youtube it its awesome P And we could made some comments on the movie to pass the timeAnd once again I am happy Im a guy cause the only real things that caught my attention were Bulma and that Piccolo henchman chick  Well all in all its funny but you should only go to the cinema knowing youre gonna pay  euros for a waste of time But with that thought it can be fun  Btw that Goku guy makes a lot of the same expressions as the Chosen One from Kung Pow Kung Pows acting and humor is way better tho P,Negative
im giving this movie a  just to raise the the average vote cause this movie is in no way a  i mean sure its not like the anime but what movie could summarize the whole anime its simply impossible still i felt the dragonball vibe all over the movie it had an interesting storyline with some goofy parts and it was very light it followed the dragonball history but kept it original as for the actors justin chatwin did a good job although a bit different from the original goku one of the parts i liked more was from bulma i think she nailed the character perfectly i didnt like master roshi however they ruined the character and is it just me or does joon park have the exact voice as yamcha overall i liked the movie its not dragonball its dragonball evolution and they did just that,Negative
the rating of this movie  at the moment and not the movie is what pisses me off I watched quit a few movies and all I can tell is there are lots of garbage movies with a rating around  to  this movie is a solid  or  if it comes to the movie itself but unfortunately people are not rating the movie but how bad it is compared to the real deal dragonball dragonball is a  on the scale thats how awesome it is and thats why people are so angryI guess most people expected dragonball evolution to easily become the best movie ever made since it is based on the most successful anime ever madeand since it failed to be as awesome as the anime its a  what logicim very sorry for ya fans to not being able to enjoy this movie,Negative
Ive been watching the cartoon for about  years I have watched all episodes over and over again and never get boredThis movie is boring Suck Nothing like the story Characters are ugly Goku is not a skinny white American boy Goku doesnt go to high school Goku does not chicken out a fight Goku loves to fight What the hell is wrong with the director Anyone can direct a movie and make it suck He needs to be shot Im serious guy took a good anime and make it hell Even Power Rangers is better then this movie Why not have the director of Xmen or Spiderman make this movie They really screwed it up badly on this one The director needs to get fired badly omg this movie is a complete joke,Negative
If theres lower than  rating i would give it to this flop movie This movie ruined the Dragonball name Every details of movie is so Fed up Hollywood please pleaseplease Dont ever try to make movies about anime ever again We anime lovers dont like changing the stories from Manga to anime to live action movie We want to see how will it evolved from paper to real And not messing the whole story and changed it to your ownEven the costumes of the characters are so messed up Hollywood just stick messing with Dc and marvel movies Dont touch anime ever again So ill give a  vote out of  So awful that after seeing it i puke,Negative
Firstoff it was called Dragonball not Dragonball Z It did follow the DRAGONBALL story line a lot more accurately than i thought it would have I realize this was not the blockbuster film we all wanted it to be but it was pretty badass So they got rid of the whiny baldheaded krillen and left room for the smoking hot girls to shine BooFreakingHoo PS He was dead throughout the entire King Piccolo saga anywayThey may have done a couple things wrong but DAMN that was a fun movie to watchPPS I really give this movie about a  but I feel the need to try and cancel out all the morons who give this a  just because Goku is white RACISTS,Negative
I dont need to see it to know Ill hate it Piccolo wasnt a king and didnt wear a crazy black space uniform  Goku knew of Roshi long before he was a teenager  Goku already knew how to use his powers before he was a teenager  Im also fairly sure there wont be a flying nimbus or a power pole I may be wrong on some of these points I havent actually seen the movie and i wont until it comes to DVD but still the TV trailer and theater trailer looked to be horribleway to ruin my favorite childhood show selloutsEPIC FAIL,Negative
Lets get this clear Hollywood butchers stories from books games and anime like clockwork but this is something else entirely I was afraid this movie would not only ruin the Dragon Ball name but it would misinform people who do not like Dragon Ball There is a slight relief in the fact that whether or not you are a Dragon Ball fan you will find that this movie is terribleAs the summary states this is a train wreck you dont want to watch it but you cant look away I expected the Dragon Ball aspects to be changed to the directors whims which they were from story elements to character uniforms however they went one step beyond This movie was completely converted into something far worse than even the worst s low budget kung fu flickWhen you remove all the Dragon Ball fan service as WELL as any shred of a credible story the question posed to the studio is Who do you think is going to enjoy this,Negative
This is just an all out disgrace I cant believe they did this to something that I loved to watch as a kid Listen this movie is so bad Id rather watch the Ben  madefortv movie with my son  times straight before I watch this movie again and thats saying something Not only is it a disgrace to Akira Toriyama and his wonderful Dragonball universe its a really bad movie Everything about it was off It shouldnt even have been called Dragonball These dragonballs sure do stink real bad and collecting em all couldnt create a wish big or good enough to fix this Unless they remade this movie with A LOT MORE MONEY at least  hours long good director better casting ratedR or at least pg rating better fighting better storyline better dialog Effin everything that would make a movie stand out theres no way Hollywood should ever touch this or any other classic anime If Gatchaman or Ninja Scroll are anything like this movie when they come out I will definitely blow,Negative
I have been WAITING for this app to let me write a review it FINALLY is allowing me to do it I have always love dragon ball DBZ and GT Super is out and thats great as well Akira Toriyamas mind is amazing for what he has done If anyone thought this movie was his doing they would be naive and havent truly seen the series This is an atrocity to all that is Dragon Ball Acting is mediocre at best the script sounds like it came from a  year olds dream when they try to make it cooler than it actually is No one in this movie even resembled any of the characters from the series Even though they FORCED it with Gokus hair except for Yamcha thats EXTREMELY agruable HOW did James Wong even get the approval for this movie All in all this was a sad excuse for Dragon Ball,Negative
For all of you who dont agree with me sure the storyline was a little off but if you think about it many people have only read the animes and mangas but not a lot of people havent read the original story The Monkey King wreaks Havok in Heaven There is another movie that relates to that book its the Forbiden Kingdom Once you have read that story you will come to realize that the anime and mangas have been a little off the original storyline As the movie it was good If you would have stuck to the original there would have been a lot of things that the director wouldnt have been able to depict in the movie I am actually looking forward to seeing the sequel,Negative
I know this movie is getting a lot of hate from GB fans because many things were different from the movie and TVcomics series But this movie wasnt really trying to be exactly like the show For one thing in the show Goku never went to school In the movie he goes to school and thats where he meets ChiChi Thats way off but not that bad The movie is about Goku who who is set out upon his grandpa dying request to find the great Master Roshi and find all  of the dragonballs he already has one Upon his journey he meets Bulma Master Roshi and Yamcha They need to find the dragonballs before Picolo does or else bad things happenThe acting is kinda bad and very noticeable The fight scenes arent that great but its alright The movie is entertaining and thats why its pretty good So overall the movie passed my liking being greater than that cheesy Street Fighter movie that came out this past FebruaryDragonball Evolution ,Negative
This movie should have never been made Thank god Akria Toryimia agreed with us and made Battle of Gods and Resurrection F Hollywood needs to stop screwing up stuff that is better as it is Heck this movie should be banned worldwide Just so everyone knows I love the Dragon Ball series minus this god awful movie This movie is worse then a lot of remakes I have seen To me and a lot of other anime fans who love DBZGT this movie makes us want to die or puke it doesnt matter which I really hate this movie I would wither watch Barney the dinosaur over this movie I hate this movie because they messed up Goku Also because they messed up all the characters and the events,Negative
DragonballEvolution is adaptation of a graphic novel made by Akira ToriyamaDragonball achieved worldwide glory as a cartoonbut the movie did not repeated the success of the cartoonWhyThe answer is pretty simpleMost of the people who have watched and reviewed this film are fans of the cartoonThis adaptation is not bad at allThe actingdirection and the script are pretty decentand special effects are very goodI think that if you have not watched the cartoon there are greater chances to like this movieIt is not very intelligentbut it can be decent entertainmentespecially for young boys who love the world of fantasy and actionFor adults it is recommended only if they want to escape from the real world into the world of fantasy,Negative
The movie seemed much shorter than it really is because it was constantly moving There werent any inappropriate lulls There was some corny humor but definitely not enough to spoil the actual funny parts Great effects of course Bulma did a wonderful job as main character although it seems odd that she becomes so comfortable with gokus presence in her life in such a short amount of time Theres a lot of parts that are totally unreal but I guess if youre going to see a movie about machines that turn into rational robots you cant expect too much reality For those who tend to pick apart movies there are a lot of unexplained instances throughout the movie that you can mull over later but all in all a must see in the movie theaters Hopefult theyll be a sequel PS did you do thatYeah I did,Negative
The worstweirdest episode of Shameless Wheres Frank,Negative
I knew it I knew it The first time I heard that Hollywood was going to make a liveaction version of one the most popular Japanese action animation series I was very sceptic Because I know how most of the big film companies work They want to make something that appeals to a large audience so they can cash in on the profits In doing that they always destroy the purity of the original story I know that sacrifices have to be made Not everything from the DBZ world can be put in a live action movie but common Why did have to make such a dumb movie with so much clichs Goku a high school teenager with teenage problems He gets trained by his grandfather in martial arts UuuhmKarate Kid anyoneThis movie sucks so much that I can write pages full of bad comments about it Instead of that Ill urge everyone to watch the following youtubeclip which expresses precisely what my feeling are about this movie httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvaVnIRfYJWXWatch it and spread this clip if your are also disappointed in this movie adaption,Negative
I have watched this series all the way from beginning to end and I like to think of myself as a pretty big fan of Dragonball Z Unfortunately my excitement over the fact that they are making this sham of a movie turned quickly to disappointment when I watched the first trailer Nothing is faithful to the original series Instead of trying to just put the show onto the big screen for fans and others to enjoy they have warped it into something that doesnt even closely resemble Dragonball For the many people out there who dont know what Dragonall is I feel like this movie is just going to turn them against the franchise In just those few minutes of the preview there are so many inaccuracies that I almost wanted to cry Unfortunately I probably will not go see this movie Maybe in a few years after this movie has tanked spectacularly they will make another that people will actually want to see,Negative
Somebody once said this was the biggest insult America did to Japan since Hiroshima Hahaha Anyways intentions were good but the Movie itself was very not good wouldnt waste your time just stick with the anime,Negative
The movie is watchable but only uptil the age of ,Negative
Not even Boll himself could have produced a worse adaptation of a beloved franchise Im flabbergasted its rating is as high as it is Even the Super Mario Bros movie was more endearing in its remarkable stupidity and laughably liberal use of characters I dont even have fun mocking this film thats how terrible it is Its not worth examining to see where it failed and its not worth my typing this out Manos The Hands of Fate is a masterpiece in comparison It makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock Pierre Kirby like Shwarzenegger and Shwarzenegger like Humphrey BogartDont watch it Dont Dont do it Its the Jekyll and Hyde game of the film industry,Negative
A really lacklustre experience Ive never seen the cartoon and dont plan to but watched the movie with an open mind The digital effects for one werent great though not terrible either the fight choreography and editing though doesnt work in many scenes and comes off as incredibly cheesy Its not particularly well acted either with some very bad line delivery The setting of the movie was very confusing too it clearly starts in the USA yet suddenly theres an environment with loads of Lava and martial arts culture what Also are the characters meant to be travelling too and if so how Even the costumes arent any good and many of the high school students look older than me Characters are not properly set up or introducd either the villain is dull and the ending cringeworthy Im not outraged by the movie though theres a few bits of humour a fairly fun tone and a brisk pace but it also leaves a lot to be desired,Negative
They almost destroyed dragon ball I can just watch the first  minutes Everything is wrong in the movie I dont know where the  million went to Ive seen better effects in non budget amateur movies Goku a teenager Are we crazy Gokus never been a teenager Goku never went to school either And who decided to take out Krillin Whatever this could be minor problems if everything else was OK but is not the case Boring direction cinematography and art direction They just wanted some money and they made the movie without watching or reading anything of dragon ball Hollywood is having a bad time that proves itIn conclusion this isnt a movie is an abortion Well just have to wait until Fox takes this project to someone with a brain this could take  years,Negative
Worst freaking movie ever Everything about this movie is wrong and not right This movie shouldnt even exist If you gonna cast the characters at least cast them right Especially the MAIN CHARACTER GOKU Do your research before making a live action film of one of the most popular anime of history,Negative
This is the first time watching anything Dragon Ball Z I enjoyed the acting and script as it seemed to be alike to comics or Anime scenes The writing was fun as there were a lot of times that it felt like anime but with real actors and actresses I dont agree with the low rating since this movie was entertaining and thats what movies should be If you were not entertained by this movie then it must take a lot more to entertain you I thought there was comical scenes loving scenes and really cool action scenes The film was believable to me and I enjoyed diving in the entertainment,Negative
Other than names and likenesses this movie used nothing from the source material and was a massive let down It is  percent clear that nobodys heart or mind for that matter was in this film It ruined Wongs directing career and made it impossible to adapt any film from a Japanese IP for at least a decade This was a total cash grab by FOX and they basically admitted it They had the rights it was about to expire so they slid this absolute deuce out onto the silver screen The majority of the budget was spent on marketing just so they would at least break even This is all wildly similar to the story of how the live action Super Mario Bros of the s was made and received,Negative
I have close to a  friends and we all at one time went to go see the movie We all left with in an hour time We though the movie was going to like the anime serious That was the worst film in my life Dragon ball is a young child from another planet That was sent to earth to destroy it then came a old man name Gohan that found the child and the rest is history Whats next Dragon ball z the return of piccolo come on man you basically destroyed the dragon ball world with that movie I think if you want to redeem yourself need to count this one as a loss and start over go back to movie people and say with all the negative feed back we need to start over And call this movie DRAGON BALL THE Beginning start the movie off with Frieza destroying planet veg eta Do it the right way and the  million fans will love you for it,Negative
"This has to be one of the worst movies EVER to be madewhy is goku white
 Whys his hair looks like that I dont think thats bulma OR roshi
 Piccolo looks like a poorly designed s movie alien
 Worst plot everIt spits in the face of every DBZ DBGTDB and DBS fanIt ruined my childhood and its an insult to the Saiyan race martial arts the turtle school ACTING these actors careers my ears eyes brain and my memoryId choose the to watch or experience the James Bond Casino Royale Chair scene over and over before Id EVER watch this movie againWhyd they make this broWho thought this would be a good movie when they were making it how didnt they knowDont watch save yourself",Negative
 because I have a wish I wish I havent paid  Taiwan Dollars to watch this absolute waste of a film What a screw up Its the worst film everJustin Chatwin sucks at his acting For once even  sexy girls Emmy ROssum and the sexy Japanese chick who plays Picolos henchwoman forgot her names spelling cannot save me from foul mouthing this goddamn waste of a film A literal waste of talent money time etc Only thing that keeps me from walking outta the theatre is Chow Yun Fatt he is as cool as he is since his performance in The Killer I wouldnt ela borate much on how much this film sucked other users have already mentioned on that But heres my verdictWords possible to describe Dragonball Evo words  Absolute Waste of Time  words  Dont Watch It  words  Rip Off  word  suckedBye bye ,Negative
From the moment your gaze falls upon the films poster you brace yourself for a comedic ride anticipating the cinematic fiasco thats about to unfold Venturing into the theater laughter was expected but instead I was greeted by a parody of Dragon Ball so audaciously flawed it borders on comic genius This film attempts to ground the beloved saga in reality but strays so far from its inspiration it seems the creators set out to disappointEfforts to mirror Dragon Balls essence end up resembling reflections in a carnivals distorted mirror warped bizarre and unintentionally hilarious This cinematic endeavor serves as a masterclass in how not to execute a parody blending misplaced sarcasm misguided satire and a remarkable inability to hit any target Those seeking laughter will find it not in the script but in marveling at how spectacularly this film fails to capture what made the original so greatIn a twistedly ironic way it becomes the perfect comedy its misalignment so egregious laughter is the only response to its boldness With over  characters of critique this review highlights the films journey from potential to comedic folly marking Dragon Ball Evolution as an unintentionally humorous chapter in the Saiyan saga,Negative
First I want to say Where is the evolution in this movie Goku is already in a city at school and wanted girls not martial arts This is very stupid they made character awful Goku and girls  KameMaster Roshi is in center of lake in a big city and in a awful house Then all movie was talk searcing and so on when at final with Picolo fight that was just an not a big effect then movie is finish and  min   min uncut version of your life for nothing To bad they done this to the Dragon Ball anime that was amazing anime and it is today We hope that it will be another movie that is will be a very good one as the anime,Negative
This is the funniest movie of all time I would give this movie a  if I could because its so bad its good Everyone needs to see this masterpiece,Negative
This movie was a slow plane crash from beginning to endThe ANIME in itself was sooo good that I actually watched the entire DBE movie hoping that something would relate to the animebut that wasnt the caseI apologize to Akira Toriyama for whoever was involved in destroying his world famous masterpiece The same masterpiece that took America by storm even before the pokemon phenomenaThe d animation the actors chosen the setting the story the fight scenes the kamehameha wave the anticlimactic ending the roles the executionall wrong stupid patheticI pictured DBE to be more like The Matrix series mixed with The th Element Final Fantasy Advent Children and the XMen series remember when they removed Cyclops glasses and his eyes shot this huge beam and blew a massive hole through the building roof THAT was along the lines of a decent kamehameha waveBut what do I know Ive only been a fan for  years Not  minutes,Negative
This movie is a disgrace to the dragon ball series,Negative
I had a high expectations to see this movie but I was highly disappointed its crap laggy and its not amazing as it should looks too much dramas and Piccolo looks more like a power rangers villain haters of dragon ball z will surely enjoy it or those who doesnt like animes,Negative
Amazing movie stuck close to the original manga and anime source material I watched  episodes of Dragon Ball GT so I know what Im talking about A one of a kind perfect movie with no clear problems in my eyes Perfect cast and very very accurate representations of the characters in Dragon Balls Z Amazing CGI and amazing costume work Deserves best picture and best costume design along with hundreds of other awards I would give it an  if I could,Negative
Honestly i understand why people usually dont like this film It has no faithfullness to the manga and anime and it has a very lame script But a long time ago when i was a DB fan i liked this film I enjoyed watching it And i also liked to see the differences between this and the source materialOn the technichal level it was pretty good The scenarios are goodlooking and the fight choreographies are pretty goodWhat makes me sad about this film is that people hate it as if it was a second holocaust As if this film caused any death And they exaggerate This film is decent but honestly i would watch it if the showed it on TV,Negative
Watched this years ago and i STILL have things to say about it  because this movie dishonored the animes legacy harder than any villain ever couldthe only thing evolving was my regretacting so wooden it made the sets look alive It was like watching a middle school play but somehow still sadderwhy did we turn goku into a high school drama rejectthe hair didnt even go blondeoverall dragonball evolution is proof that nostalgia cant save everything and that not all wishes should be granted The anime we love is screaming somewhere,Negative
Its like the movie See you yesterday Thats about it,Negative
The only good thing about this movie is the Kamehameha and awesome technology Otherwise Gokus acting was terribleAnd even if this movie would be like a prequel to Dragon Ball Z They should make a sequel to this movie where Goku became epic They recruited Piccolo Tien and Krillin Gohan is born and Vegeta finally arrives on the scene and that Hollywood can finally find out what a Saiyan is Oh yeah did I mention the fight scenes were terrible Fights were too short and I wanted them to more epic Well if you would even take the time to make a sequel and market it during Dragon Ball Z Kai or during shows with viewers who even know what a Dragon Ball is well then sure life would be great,Negative
There has been a lot of exchange between US and Japanese cinema Seven Samurai and The Glorious Seven The Godzilla movie that was more like another Jurassic Park with a Monster that didnt even look like Godzilla EtcBut this movie This movie is a absolute train wreck Everyone who knows not even likes DB will tell you this movie is a train wreck It is an insult to the intelligence of DB fans There have been bad movies that  years later gained entertainment value This movie wont It will always stay the steaming pile of  it is Selfrespecting DB fans hate it and people who dont care wont watch itLike Godzilla this movie has only the name in common with the original The rest is annoying insulting crap DB fans just watch the trailer and as soon as they see Goku theyll know they hate this movieThis movie is so bad that despite it having already  reviews I took the time to register with IMDb and to tell you how ty this movie is It is not bad bad would be probably good in  years It is pure annoying and insulting   if i could,Negative
The story was definitely mixed up a bit fusing some elements of certain points of the actual story so that they could be DONE with Dragonball and Work on with DBZFor all of you Whiney boo hoo babies out there that are mad about the changesdont watch the movie because you simply will not like itit stays completely true to the series and adds a more realistic touch to it and thats that If you havent already seen this movie and you know that you arent expecting DragonBall  then go see it if you want  Dragonball with all the goods then go make one and then lets have a chat but as for me i loved the movie and im a HUGE fan of the series i can tell all the changes that theyve made but hey heres the thing WATCH the movie  time then compare and contrast the nd time dont walk in all OMG this is gonna suck big time they spoiled DB for life,Negative
The movie has not yet been released here in my city I hope they do release it As a ultra fan of Dragonball series  I really expect everything to be as same as in the series I heard a lot of rumors during my survey that this movie is going to suck big time and stuff but I really think in a different way According to the survey I came to a conclusion that Yes all the characters and scenes and relations has been changed drastically but thats what director is suppose to do He gave us Goku Bulma Piccolo and all the other characters back but just in a different way Please If you truly are a big fan then try to appreciate Wongs work At least he triedanyone who knows about the actual release date for Dragonball Evolution then please let me know at my email address Thanks,Negative
YunFat Chow He must be seriously thinking about sacking his agent An actor of his calibre in a film which barely makes up for the pop corn You would rack your brains trying to find positives for this film But then again I must have known just by looking at the posters Why did I watch it then Well because I have been watching Dragonball anime years and years ago and I was utterly disappointed even beyond the cushion of low expectations I prepared myself with Yes bracing yourself before going to the pictures isnt going to help for that film The special effects were fine  in the early s The plot didnt do remotely justice to the anime The director must have been taking the ps because you cannot seriously try to make a good film and end up with thisAvoid at all cost,Negative
i love Dragon ball since i was a little boyNow there make it real in live action film First things i though in my head can they really make this movieAfter i finish watch this movie at cinema i found that this movie is a Blast But the effect was horrible by the way i love Goku Bulma and Chi Chi Their acting was good i Love Justin Chatwin Emmy Rossum and Jaime Chung They really perfect for their roleFor those who Just want to enjoy and relaxing at cinema i suggest u to see this movie i laugh every time i see at funny part But I know some of you did not like this movie No matter what are you saying to this movie i will still love it,Negative
I would like to ask if the people responsible for this movie ever watched one episode of Dragon Ball before doing the movieI would advise to change the name to something else because it has absolutely nothing to do with Dragon ball A disrespect to this great AnimeIt would be better that someone from marvels movies Heroes series etc do itBest regardsPhilipp Gieseking,Negative
This was the funniest film Ive seen all year Dont tell me it wasnt a comedy I know Dragonball and that WASNT it I was just waiting for the director to pop up at the end laughing and say Nah just kidding The real Dragonball movie comes out next year Fooled you Wed all let out a sigh of relief and rejoiceWorst lineGoku I must become one with twoNo Goku No you mustnt You need to have someone cut your tail off What you dont have a tail Well then I guess were all screwed Honestly just watch the anime Its a million times better than this and it doesnt have any of these stupid clichs,Negative
It is a complete disgrace It is a steaming pile Im ashamed to introduce this movie to my friends who havent watch the original series How dare the director make our childhood series become a twilight Im so insulted by this even the original DBZ creator was so angered he started making DBS which is not as good as DBZ but its still worth watching compared to dragon ball evolution I have a better name for this movie Ill call it Disgraceful balls of Emostuff This is my st time writing a review which I dont ever do other than rate movies but this movie angered me to the point I cant take it anymore thats why Im writing this review I got news they even made some merchandise to milk out more money as if this movie isnt bad enough,Negative
This movie is not just horrible it makes any true fan of the actual series rage Plot is absolutely atrocious characters are ridiculous and stupid and doesnt follow the cannon what so ever It makes no sense and gives you a pain in the pit of your stomach This movie is trash mindnumbing shite that doesnt deserve to exist Any true fan will hate this movie so watch it only if you plan on wanting to die   if I could Waste of my life and yours dont watch it,Negative
Hollywood has done it again They tried to copy the comictomovie craze with their tried and tested animemangatomovie craze Guess what happened NOTHING In the case of boxoffice flop Speed Racer this film inevitably jumps the shark with everything that goes wrong when adapting manga or anime to the silver screen Hollywoodizing the source material character personalities right down to their names Obviously Hollywood has serious cultural issues What a shame because its one of the best animemangas out there so if I were you Id watch the original Japanese series over this one Nobody learned their lesson over Speed Racer and sadly in Dragonball Evolution which should have been titled Dragonball Devolution Its one of the worst films of  and a strong contender for the Bottom ,Negative
Relax Yes its not true to the cartoon but just because its not the same doesnt make it bad Enjoy it with your kids or just enjoy watching the silliness and action,Negative
This is nothing like dragon ball the series The only thing thats the same is the names of the characters This movie is painful to watch and corny in not a good way I got more and more angry the further into the movie I got Watch it for free if you want to give it a try but youll regret it if you pay anything for this crap,Negative
this was the worse adaptation to anything Ive ever seen i grew up watching dragonballdragonball Z and this was a terrible movie first off to start goku is on his own since he was a kid he met everyone in the movie when he was small master roshi was bald bulma had blue hair they couldnt even get the basics right then came the fact that this movie was so disgraceful to anyone who had ever seen any of the dragonball series it looks like the director caught  dragonball episodes and thought he could try and make a movie out of it if just wish someone who actually knew about the series would try and make a movie not someone who had no idea the movie didnt even mention that goku was a saiyan and what the hell does air bending have to do with anything this isnt avatar,Negative
Truth is im a big fan of combat movies with tons of vfx I agree with all the other comments the ones who created this movie havent watched enough episodes The storyline and everything is messed up nothing relates to the original anime series Its like making a movie after a movie but all you watched is the trailer This movie is not made for the fans of the Dbz anime series even tho the creators probably thought they were making it so The least they could do is keep to the original storyline not just take the characters and make your own story wich is worse Even i would have come up with a better DragonBall movie than this,Negative
This was probably the biggest disappointment in a film of my life It would of easily rivaled other movies based off classic toys and TV shows if it had a better director and was less corny All they had to do was make it pg and they would have been able to take out all of the parts that you actually feel embarrassed to watch and add fight scenes that were a little more graphic and realistic The acting was a little shotty in places but with a storyline this bad it wouldnt matter who was in it The worst part though was easily put on the director and producers Whether it was the obviously fake backgrounds or the fact that they developed and showed how the characters were so badly Overall they should try Dragonball Z again but should put on a little bigger budget,Negative
I dont understand why everyone has such a problem with this movie Its far from being the disaster that the Street Fighter movie was I mean I have no idea what the anime is about or how close it sticks to it but I had a hell of a lotta fun watching this It really felt like a live action anime It featured a good looking cast good special effects and pretty good fight scenes Sure the film was silly and even less sillier than most animes are It look a lot of getting used to to see what they were going for and truth be told somethings just work better animated But all in all a very entertaining film not very deserving of the unfortunate rep its getting,Negative
Was going through my DVDs and spotted this as a red flag Removing this from my DVD collection Waste of space This is movie is so far from capturing anything dragonball They could have made a better movie with a bunch of cosplay people from comicon,Negative
Dragonball has been around for  years nowit has become a cultural icon and one of the popular things just like PokemonPower RangersYu GiOhetcPeople who love Dragonball can make a better movie than the terrible movie Dragonball EvolutionThe guy who plays as Goku Justin Chatwin seems like a miscast because his acting as Goku seems nothing like himTh movie seems like it was trying to make a movie franchise out of the movie and change a lot from Dragonball Like how Goku does not have a tailKrillin is not the best friend of Goku because the movie made him an outcastBulma has one small streak of hair to confirm she is BulmaGoku is madly in love with ChiChi even though in the show he doesnt know what being in love is likeand most of the characters and history in the movie is nothing like DragonballThis movie is definitely on the list for worst movies ever and worst adaptions ever,Negative
"For the longest time I thought The Last
Airbender was the most insulting live action adaptationThey weirdly have a lot in common But somehow the level of competency has plummeted even deeper This is one of the worst looking films Ive seen from a visual perspective And the acting is an even further departure from the iconic anime characters theyre portrayingThis movie makes The Last Airbender and Death Note  watchable that pretty much says it all",Negative
Yes the movie is terrible from every point of view But when you accept that this is more a fan fiction than anything else and its one of the worst movie ever made You start to laugh and have fun at how ridiculous it isHighly recommend it,Negative
Let me start by saying I never write movie reviews online hardly ever even give suggestions to friends That being said let me continue by stating the fact that growing up I loved this series of cartoons and got really angry when I missed an episode I had low expectations going into this movie and when it was in theater my friends didnt want to see it so i didnt get to see it But then it was only a dollar to rent to I figured why not rightBad life choice Movie was terrible short unfulfilled not accurate to the cartoon version and left me feeling like I wasted my life This movies only saving grace was there were two hot Asian girls I cant believe they made an  year old Goku At least get that right Well even though the curiosity killed the cat this time I can safely say I will not be seeing the sequel to this unless I get bored again and get curious but honestly terrible movie dont waste your time especially if you were a fan of the original series,Negative
Having never been exposed to the Dragonball franchise this film could not ruin any preconceptions that I may have had were I a fan of the original series Coming into this film with a blank slate I was impressed and entertained throughout The action scenes were good Gokus character progression was well done and I even liked the song at the end during the credits I would recommend this to anyone that wants to see a lighthearted action movie Obviously fans seem to universally hate this film but that must be because it is roughly based in the Dragonball universe not a direct adaptation As a stand alone product there is very little wrong with this movie,Negative
i love all the dradonballz series but this was a total butcher of the cartoon anime i would of thought they would be smarter then that goku should have been a  year old kid or something around that age they could have made him right innocent and strong or they could have least made him a super saiyan idk piccolo didnt look right they should have made ALL of bulmas hair blue and made master roshis house on an island and they didnt even make shenron green i would think that they would have been clever to not copy the dragon ball series and start at the ending of dragon ball gt where they left ofso no one could tell of their mistakes i also thought that everything looked to fake so i do advise that if you love dragonball anime you probably wont think this is better if i am wrong then it is because i only saw this movie once when it first came out and forgot a few things but a fan doesnt forget,Negative
Good lord this movie is garbage I didnt even know it was a DBZ movie and I thought it was some crappy parody or something This doesnt feel like a Dragon Ball movie at all It feels like a rushed middle school projectTo be fair the writer of Evolution has admitted he never watched Dragon Ball but I didnt think it would be this badThe characters look nothing like they did in the source material and they dont even act the same Krillin is not in the movie Roshi looked like a some  year old man wanting to be hip with kids Bulma is now a bounty hunter Since when Its kinda sad how the only characters that were almost accurate were Gohan and MaiBut lets talk about the biggest thing they got wrong Goku Hes nothing like the one we all know hes apparently this socially awkward teen womanizer that goes to schoolYou know the movies bad when Toriyama himself also hated the movie,Negative
One of the worst adaptations of a beloved franchise One of the worst live action versions of an animated property More concisely said just one of the worst movies of all timeIt is fascinating the changes they decide to make to the story They do everything in their power to make this story more generic and less interesting I want to be in the meeting where they thought having Goku go to high school dealing with bullies was a good ideaThe effects are awful the acting is awful the story will take mindless detours that wastes the audience and characters time Not being faithful to the source material is one thing but being this bad is something else entirelyIt really is something that has to be seen to be believed It is the car crash that you cant help but stop and stare It is a disaster so bad no amount of Shenron wishes would be able to save it,Negative
so i just watched Dragonball Evolution Im trying to get the way I felt while watching this movie and I can only describe it as this Imagine youre watching the worst movie youve ever seen eating popcorn Then suddenly you realize that youre not eating popcorn but your firstborn child As horror sears this image onto your soul you hear the faint sound of kamehameha and the complete annihilation of anything that was ever entertaining or held sacred by canon This is a brief glimpse of what it is like to watch this movie Now imagine youre me who paid two dollars to experience this and add the gutwrenching horror that this  hrs of your life couldve been better spent rubbing lye into your eyes At least as your eyesight was burned away you wouldve seen something with a more convincing plot than Dragonball Evolution,Negative
 is the actual score I want to postbasically do not watch this movie  E V E R It is not really anything to do with dragonballzgt They took the characters about  of the plot and sucked the soul out of the whole thing firmly bending it over and totally ing it up beyond all recognitionEven people who have never had contact with the original manga and anime will say this is the worst movie ever producedSo much is wrong with it It is impossible to defend thisplease torture to death those responsible for this horrific clusterI mean did they really think that fans of the original series would watch this Any fan of the series would have walked out after the first  minutesand i am being generous and demanded a refund and possibly compensation for severe mental traumaBURN ALL COPIES AND NEVER LET THIS HORROR HAPPEN AGAIN ANYONE INVOLVED IN CREATING THIS SHOULD NEVER WORK AGAIN ANYONE INVOLVED IN CREATING THIS SHOULD ISSUE A FORMAL APPOLOGY TO THE FAN BASEI WOULD SOONER WATCH A STATIONARY TURD AS IT DECOMPOSES THAN WATCH THIS MOVIE EVER AGAIN,Negative
It brought the legendary creator of Dragon Ball out of retirement reigniting the beloved franchise and leading to the creation of two new installments Dragon Ball Super and Dragon Ball Daima This unexpected return thrilled fans worldwide as it introduced fresh stories powerful characters and new adventures while staying true to the spirit of the original series The revival not only expanded the Dragon Ball universe but also showcased the enduring popularity and cultural impact of the franchise across generations uniting longtime fans and newcomers alike So thats why its a  out of ,Negative
While the movie was lacking in  several aspects of the anime I was surprised how well it turned out I was even surprised I managed to get goose bumps during certain parts Perhaps it was because like the anime it got to the point a little quicker Dont get me wrong I appreciated that in the anime however they did have to squeeze a whole saga into roughly two hours that impressed me Overall the movie could use more as for what that more is who knows I agree that Goku looked nothing like I expected him to Wishing for moreI did like that they tried to add every aspect of the anime keynote TRIED A for effortby the way  the end scene was lame,Negative
If you are a fan of Dragon Ball dont even waste your time with this piece of junk It is not only a bad Dragon Ball film but a bad film in general,Negative
Were there a God Id like to think he wouldnt make people this dumbThis just the absolute worst movie ever made and Im still pissed off about it  years laterThe only movie worse than this is Transformers the last knightI cant believe I cant rate this a Whats funny is the people that rated this  also hatred it theyre just too nice to give it what it deserves I clicked to read into the reviews cause I couldnt understand why anyone would rate this higher than the lowest possible ratingI doubt anyone even watched one episode as over half the names are pronounced incorrectlyI agree with folks saying you dont have to be a dbz fan to hate this movie Fan or no fan this was a terrible movie,Negative
One thing about doing a live adaptation of a Japanese series is that the contents tied to the original series is often removed and traded for changes that would hopefully strike a balance in appealing to the various different marketsThis was where Dragonball  Evolution totally failedNot only did the movie lose its fans of the original series through the various changes made it also failed to impress those who are new to the DragonBall nameDragonball  Evolution could be said to have no connection to the original DragonBall series at all except for the characters design and nameIn this case the title DragonBall is merely used as a advertising tool with non of the good points taken from the original seriesIf you are a DragonBall fan you would be disappointedIf you are not one you would hardly be entertainedThis movie failed to show seriousness but couldnt provide the laughs one would have expected even when taken as a comedic filmA prime example of a production train wreck that failed to live up to its name,Negative
Everything about this is bad I just finished watching it again because I was bored It was so lame I couldnt focus on the movie And as somebody who watched the show on and off for  years I am not basing my views on the movie on how different it is from the showThis movie should have never been made The world would be a better place without it,Negative
I am a fan of Dragon Ball and the is the worst thing I have seen in my whole life how could he how This is not even Dragon Ball no actor looks even a bit like the real Dragon Ball cartoon characters no goku no bulma no piccolo no Mr roshi this is fooool Even the the fighting is nothing more than a little feminine kids trying to fight and worst of all there are guns oh my goodness I am going crazy and what the fin SUPER SAIYAN GOKU is bullied by earthlings and who this actor taking Gokus role think he is just give me one  reason why would this be goku what a mockery this is not dragonball story in any way and if who did this is planning on another movie he better not Just if we meet  er One last word if you think you cant bring a fighting scene just like in the real Dragon Ball I say you stay at home dont think that because you added a good effects this is dragonball no no no Thanks whoever reading this ,Negative
I loved this film Its so good One of my all time faves I enjoyed the King Piccolo Saga of Dragonball which is what this movie was adapted from If you pay close attention they do have some stuff or pay homage to from the cartoon It has a great message always have faith in who you are for kids and adults alike Im not too big on DBZ cartoon but this film I totally love Cheesy yes Bad You could say But I absolutely love it,Negative
I really dont know why this movie got so much hate the characters were lovable the acting was great and the fighting scenes was enjoyable Maybe its because Im easily pleased when it comes to films overall it was interesting and really entertaining to watch I think if the film was made to win the hearts of the viewers they wouldve went above and beyond with the affects and all,Negative
Dragonball unlike anything else is a show that is really meaningful to me I GREW up just like millions of others watching this awesome show i like millions of others became a devoted fan Purchase the entire DVD collection also the anime movies and every so and then i watch the entire  sagas from episode When i heard of this movie coming up and all the budget they were going to spend I JUST SAID please let it not be like Iron man hulk and all the other money that were just made for the money BUT I WAS WRONG THis is not just a money you Dont HAVE THE RIGHT TO MESS with something so precious to millions of people and corrupt it for MONEYYOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO CORRUPT SOMETHING SO MEANINGFUL if i was a rich i would have send people to pay visit to the directors of this movie and teach them a lesson of respectAnother question do the people that made this movie EVEN Watch the sagas I feel horrible because i cant even express all the dislike i feel for this movie,Negative
I am not a fan didnt even know what Dragonball was until I Googled it after seeing the movie But i am certain that if i was a fan i would have been incredibly disappointed Not only is the plot the characters the action the decor the costumes the effects and even the music really bad but they actually manage to screw up the obvious intentional humor every timeEven so the movie did not bore or annoy me It actually made me laugh mainly at how bad it is but still it was entertaining to lose  hours with it on a stormy day with nothing else to do Quoting from another person you might really get a kick out of watching it while being hammered,Negative
This movie is a total disrespect of the original Dragonball series The outrageously inaccurate portrayal of OUR Dragonball is just shocking it has got nothing to do with the comic and hell they thought its cool to add crap Hollywood elements into the film which completely destroy the untouchable classic First of all none of the actors resemble the characters in the comic a single bit and just when I thought they would create a cool looking piccolo doesnt necessary have to look completely like the one in the comic but I was in for a rude surprise to see one of the best character in the comic looking worst then ugly duckling not to mention that his role is literally non existence same goes to the storyline which again has nothing to do with the comic Without vegeta trucks red ribbons botsetc was actually the best thing in this movie else the damage done would have been unthinkable and the director might need to look for a temporary hideout,Negative
This movie has no story and the Anime is much better,Negative
I went in to see Dragonball not expecting much The trailer already told me that the movie was gonna be very Americanized have whack special effects and a white Goku Although it was exactly what I expected the movie was still pretty fun Everything was pretty lame like the acting the jokes and basically all the characters I guess the actor who played Goku got it right with the goofiness but it still felt strange All the actors were okay theyre werent horrible like Street Fighter but not great I felt that the actor that played Bulma the best out of the whole group The actor for Yamcha was misscasted he sucked balls It was weird that Cho YunFat played Master Roshi and an older actor played Grandpa Gohan when Roshi supposedly was Gohans master but whatever Overall the movie is just what youd expect The resolution and plot twist was kinda stupid and was totally different from the Dragonball tv show If the movie was at least  hours long it was only  minutes what a waste the plot couldve been better and stuff,Negative
I think someone who has never watched the cartoons or read the comic book needs to chime in A lot of these reviews are rated abnormally low because it didnt follow some story in some cartoon somewhere so I rated it abnormally high to come to the films defenseI enjoyed this movie for its entertainment value and because I didnt have any preconceived notions I wasnt expecting much going in and was pleasantly surprisedJustin Chatwin was excellent in this movie He is a extremely capable actor who did a great job giving the lead role character and a cool personality Chow Yun Fat did a great job as well giving the classic mentorsensei role a great twist and humor you dont see in most cheesy video gamecomic book based movies Jamie Chung who is absolutely gorgeous IMO was reason enough to watch the movie Her action scenes alone were much more realistic and believable than anything in that god awful wirefu Chun Li movie,Negative
Im not going to say that Dragonball Evolution is a great movie Far from it I havent really enjoyed anything Dragonball since before Dragonball Z and its episode fights and measuring contests in the form of power levels But I always enjoyed Dragonball the original creation of Akira Toriyama Its ludicrous but in a genuinely funny way and despite the standard evildoerwantstoruledestroytheworld motif it manages to stay lighthearted and funWhere this movie surprised me was how faithful it actually was to the story its based on Sure characters are missing its only a movie after all limited in time the Nimbus and Gokus rod are gone but the characters remained fairly faithful to the original concepts the basis of the story is here and the settings are great We get not only the populated areas but also the sparse wilderness and badlands the showcomic is known for Piccolos green we get to see some Saiyan ape Goku actionhonestly I dont know why actual fans of the original Dragonball complained so muchAll in all its not great but its watchable and fans of the original Dragonball should enjoy this as long as they keep expectations reasonable,Negative
As soon as the theatrical trailers came out I could tell that this movie was going to be horrific but I didnt think it would be this badFirst off the only things that resemble the mangaanime series are pretty much the names and the small part with Roshis bikini mags Other then that they butchered itIf you are a fan of the manga or the anime then I dont recommend that you watch thisThere should not be a part  ever Throw it out complete garbage What needs to happen is someone that actually knows about the series needs to step up and make a whole new movie Like the first Hulk havent watched it the whole way through yet because I keep falling asleep But the new one with Edward Norton was great If they actually make a second part to this movie it will be the biggest waste of time and money I would be surprised if they sold enough tickets in one day to fill up the whole theater,Negative
Adapting a beloved franchise like Dragon Ball comes with high expectations and Dragonball Evolution fails spectacularly on every level Instead of honoring the source material the film delivers a soulless uninspired and utterly misguided take on the legendary anime and mangaThe story is generic the characters bear little resemblance to their original counterparts and the action sequences lack the energy and excitement that made Dragon Ball iconic The dialogue is laughably bad and the CGI feels outdated even for its timeEven as a standalone film its a messpoorly written poorly directed and completely missing the essence of what made Dragon Ball special Fans deserved better This is one of the worst liveaction anime adaptations ever made,Negative
"Its kinda shame that they name this movie after dragonball The whole movie creators have no clue whats dragonball is This movie is disrespectful
It disrespect dragonball fans and insults them literally",Negative
I have never seen any of the TV series but I thought that this movie wasnt very good In my opinion they kept repeating the same thing over and over getting very annoying The movie didnt really expand on the story line and didnt have very much about it Unless theyd advanced on the story line the movie shouldnt have been as long as it was because it just dragged on Many people may disagree with me but that is just my opinion I thought the movie did have potential and opportunities but it was almost like theyd turned down every chance they got to make it a movie worth seeing Unfortunately it is not a particularly great movie and I definitely wouldnt rush to see it again,Negative
I really advise the dragonball fans and even the ones who arent to NOT SEE this sort of movieI mean a sort of movie because this i cant rate this as a movie in respect to the movie industryWe all have reasons to be scared each time a live action movie sets to be released and this one is the perfect example of whyI dont even have words to describe what went wrong becausewell it all went wrongStoryline is a joke compared to our beloved anime series the cast did an awfull job it like they didnt want to be there and i can understand why the CGI was laughable to say the leastEven the DB Evolution writer came to apologize to the DB fans it doesnt give me back the wasted time but at least he recognized the crap that was done in the first placeI can only see this movie as a barrier to not cross for future references,Negative
and thats a good thing The anime took what was great from the manga and dragged it out to a fillerslow dump This movie on the other hand breaths new life into the franchise by reimagining the story and therefore bringing new fans that probably wouldnt have stumbled upon the manga otherwise,Negative
If you are a true DBZ fan avoid even thinking about watching this garbage Its a shame too see such slaughtering of the original This so called DBZ Action Adventure Fantasy film offers the followingLame action scenes Cheesy dialogues CGI from the s for the power blasts Unbelievable weak plots Reincarnated Piccolo yeah Inappropriate casting laughable costumes Filled with all the clichs you can imagine And you know what the list stretches But I am going to stop right here and urge you all to watch DBZ series than waisting time and money on this ShT,Negative
This film is just a horrible excuse for a fun action flick that happened to have the magnificence of Dragon Ball slapped onto it I honestly dont think anyone who worked on this movie knew ANYTHING about the Dragon Ball manga or anime None of the characters in the movie are anything like their actual characters It also faces other bad problems like bad acting cheesy effects a pointless love interest and a crappy storyline Also the number of fight scenes is unbelievable For a show that has so many epic fight scenes you would think this movie would have tons right WRONGThis movie has like  fight scenes Really I counted But it all comes down to this If you are a Dragon Ball fan dont watch this If your just a normal person looking for a cool action movie dont watch this,Negative
 opposite to the original story who is goku Romeo,Negative
This is not supposed to be an exact copy of the manga or the cartoonanime The side characters are eh but they are trying to put hours of story in about an hour and a half All and all its entertaining and fast paced If you miss  minutes of this you will be lost The writing of the dialogue kind of sucks This was made and supposed to be the pre journey before dbzish story lines come about The side stuff with Bulma and Yamcha sucks but they had to rush it for the time they had Oh well its supposed to be like DB not DBZ which DB was more for kids and so was this Im sure it will get better Worth a watch though definitely,Negative
NO NO NO NO NO Unbelievable How could anyone think this was a good idea I dont even want to go into the plot So Im just going to try and get off this crappy film and try and review it as fast as possible for people thinking of watching thisThe acting is god awful Wrong casting everywhere Bulma doesnt have blue hair and acts NOTHING like she did in the original Nobody is right in this atrocity A fact The director didnt watch dragon ball z at all Its always a good idea to give a director who doesnt know anything about the franchise to direct the film Bloody brilliant The effects Oh those low budget effects Two words Hand Fart Kamehameha looks like a freaking blue air pulse thing and nothing about the moves had their explosive effect as they did in the original The cgi sweat is plain embarrassing and Im sure I could do better by inserting spheres in blender and covering them with stock footage texturesIm not sure what they were thinking but for the love of god DO NOT MAKE A ANIME A LIVE ACTION FILM,Negative
Really good movie Sorry my review is too short really great movie,Negative
This movie is a complete disaster Along with Street Fighter is one of the worse movies Ive seen in my whole life I never watched a full episode of the original series but Ive seen parts of it This movie destroy the series How can it be so bad Well in my opinion the director never watched the series either I saw this film with some friends and we were laughing at it though its not a comedy The special effects were lame and so the actors If it had been take seriously maybe it would really be a good movie to watch in DVD This movie can be only watched during a day of winter you are locked only one channel is working on your TV and its TNT So if you dont want to waste time of your life please dont watch this,Negative
"Why Akira Toriyama permit this nonsense
The worst of the worst of the worst
Im a huge dragon ball fan but this movie is an insult
I think you screenwriter must do better than this
Really i preffer put my money on to a bag and trow to a river",Negative
I had really low expectations for this so I was satisfied that it didnt totally suckI knew it was going to be a bit of a contemporary spin on DB like the lack of animals and Gokus being more of a typical person and I was cool with thatWell cast movie Chow YunFat as Roshi and especially the actor playing Yamcha were very close to character A lot of the elements of DB are retained in some way the humour Roshis less than chivalrous moments and the somewhat corny yet essential dialogue so those are plusesEffects were decent fight scenes were solid and it could have been a lot worse Took me a few minutes to settle in and not look at it too objectively If that was the first Ive heard of DB it would have been fine but its not a sterling representation of Dragonball on the whole,Negative
Totally enjoyed the movie Acting is good as well as the story line,Negative
Dragonball Evolution was a movie I hated when I went to go see it in theaters but I was  years old when I watched it I just recently saw the movie and my opinions about the movie somewhat changed The fight scenes are silly some of the time yet entertaining The acting is tolerable and the special effects are okay James Wan gave us a HORRIBLE adaptation to the manga if not the anime I felt that if someone who actually watched the damn anime or bothered to do the movie justice at all would direct this movie a whole lot better However this movie holds a place in my heart like The Last Airbender did and Ill always enjoy it,Negative
 Not to get in to too much about whats wrong with this movie but one major question i havent seen addressed is where the hell is krillin He was almost the comic relief for the cartoon He was not the most important character but didnt he grow up with Goku I may be wrong thinking he should be in the movie but he trained with Goku and Master Roshi If anyone could shed light on that it would be much appreciated And it appears that the director tried to make so much of an Americanized version of this film that he did an almost twilight type dragon ball which does not belong anywhere in this movie It was a great cartoon and even better manga I have not seen the movie yet but i will go see it even if just for reminiscent purposes I just hope I am not let down Again please someone tell where Krillin the bald little guy with the disc is at,Negative
I expected a pretty bad movie considering all the comments I had heard about the film I finally saw it today and I had a good time I laughed a lot and the movie is not that bad I was a bit disappointed when I saw the special effectsI have to say I expected a lot more The acting was decent Nothing out of the ordinary and the plot was OK although its kind of lazy sometimes If theres a sequel they should try with a new director Of course the cartoon is a lot better so if youre hoping to see a faithful adaptation of the cartoon into the big screen then youll be very disappointed Dragonball has a lot of potential they could really do Great movies with the story lines from the cartoonjust try a little harder,Negative
This film is about a modern day American teenager who was chosen to find the seven dragon balls lost somewhere in AmericaDragonball Evolution is getting scathing word of mouth even before it was released and I can see why I dont understand why the chosen guy is American and the dragon balls are in America The race to find the dragon balls is hardly exciting or adventurous eitherHowever putting aside the drastic differences compared to the original comic Dragonball Evolution is quite enjoyable It has great special effects believable romance and good looking leads Together with the cheesy plot it is good for brain off popcorn entertainment,Negative
Give dragonball evolution a chance rather screwing its name and making fun of iti think the movies gonna be gooddragonball has been the favorite of many people in the world and the people want to give rise to the new dragonball evolution movie thats koolso instead of making fun see the movie and then decide dont screw the image of dragonball evolutioniv seen the movie trailer and it looks amazingthe special effect taken are also pretty goodso i dont understandwhy people are making fun of itits gonna rule      acash,Negative
Mankinds worst attempt of trying to use cameras The scenario is far worse than a day of me in the toilet The man who made this masterpiece of garbage is clearly between  and at most  years old Please someone on IMDb make an exception and rate it  or below if possible NOT Even if you dont consider the adaptation from Dragonball which this is not the case this is still one of the vomitory movies anyone could watchLumiere are rolling in there gravesPS to MR wong rename yourself to Wrong and do not attempt to touch any other anime ever again Ever Never,Negative
This franchise has so much potential in the liveaction scene In Dragonball Evolution Goku is  and a high schoolcollege student This movie is mostly the Roshi trainingKing Piccolo arcs mashed together which is fine the whole of Dragonball condensed into one movie The pacing through the series was great and really the only thing good about this movie Seeing as they had these two arcs and Goku was  when he fought Piccolo why didnt they just set Goku at  It would be an acceptable change would it not And why did they put him in school To make him seem normal Theres the thing Goku is anything BUT normal and never had a day of formal education in his life THAT was some bullshit Also where was Krillin Krillin was a major character in the seriesHad it not been based on Dragonball it would be a mediocre movie But it ruined one of the most wellloved franchises in history and that makes it one of the worst movies of all time,Negative
If youve ever wondered what would happen if you took a beloved highenergy anime and stripped away everything that made it iconic Dragon Ball Evolution has your answer The film feels less like an adaptation and more like a rough draft of a generic teen action movie that someone vaguely themed around Dragon Ball at the last minuteThe characters barely resemble their originals Goku is reduced to an awkward highschooler Piccolo looks like he escaped from a Halloween store clearance bin and the script seems determined to avoid anything that might actually excite longtime fans The fight scenes are bland the CGI already looked dated when the movie released and the tone wobbles between unintentional comedy and outright confusionIt purely earns its place as one of the worst adaptations of an anime because it is technically a movie with a beginning middle and end But as a Dragon Ball adaptation Its a catastrophe of missed potential questionable choices and outright misunderstandings of what made the franchise special,Negative
I am watch with franx  BC Enjoyable Disregard other reviews If I could give eleven I would give twenty Very nice I likeYours trulyMehboub,Negative
"One of the worst movies ever made and a disgrace to the Dragon Ball z 
I just have nothing to say about it",Negative
I really dont see the movie deserving even the  star out of It has molested the image of Dragonball ZGT  which has been the hard work of animemakers in Japan over so many yearsThey just destroyed the epic The filmmakers should go to jail for this If there is a petition for blacklisting the filmmakers from doing any more irreparable damage  i will be more than happy to sign itThe image i had in mind for Goku was destroyed and things keep happening on their own Crappy directingproduction Its the perfect example of how you can destroy an empire by just shunning its king with some sort of rape chargesWatching the whole movie was too big a deal for me  but i endured yes  endured the whole movie just to see how bad it could get And believe me it was much worse than i had anticipated If you consider yourself a DragonBall fan  DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE I absolutely Taboo anyone from watching it,Negative
This really is as bad as everyone says it is The story is awful the characters have no development the effects are shoddy and the action is boring and thats all without mentioning the actingTheres really nothing to redeem it but even that doesnt get across just how bad this is If you watch it your face will be stuck scrunched up in pain and disgust for the entire running time,Negative
Recommended for any one who is a dragon Ball fan I enjoyed every moment of it,Negative
How do you take one of the most loved shows ever and utterly botch a live action adaptation so poorly I dont trust anyone that have this over  Star,Negative
What a steaming hot pile of garbage this was I feel so bad for the actors whose reputation was tarnished To the actors who watched and read the source material to understand the role only to be shown the garbage script The director should be sued and made to pay the actors who lost roles and money because of this inability to do anything Just make a movie without dragging a anime by using its name and characters Do not watch this as youll waste valuable minutes of your life,Negative
If i ever seen the movie called Dragon Ball Evolution I will break it Bury it Set it on fire etcThis movie ruins the movie franchise Good thing i never watched it,Negative
When I first heard about this movie I was very skeptical about how it would turn out I am a big fan of the original dragonball cartoon series and I didnt think for a second that the movie would be as goodWhen I first saw the movie I almost cried I didnt expect it to be great but I was not prepared for the crapfest that it was The acting was average and the special effects were OK not great but OK My main problem was the story I wont include any spoilers but I will say that there was no need for them to change so many thingsTo sum up a classic and brilliant story was taken and absolutely butchered If your a fan of the original series then please stay well away from this movie as you will just be disappointed like I was I just pray that the sequel gets cancelled,Negative
Theres no way this director ever watched an episode of this cartoon The actors were awful choices for the characters they played Apparently Piccolo has the same powers as Darth Vader Force Grip Yamcha was pretty cool in the cartoon this guy is possibly the biggest tool I have ever seen in my life There is no possible way to make this movie any worse I dont know whats more embarrassing having a part in the creation of this movie or the fact that i have spent an hour and a half watching the whole thing I kept watching in hopes of something happening to redeem it slightly but nothing happened Hands down the worst interpretation imaginable of something great,Negative
What a joke Please make a new Dragonball Movie with some better characterizations and do it rightStart from Dragon Ball Z if u wish as its the better and if u succeed u can go back to dragonball past or dragon ball gt futureBut u must pick at first the better one like LUCAS did with STAR WARSSo the first movies should have beenFirst Saga Vegeta Second Saga Freezer  Third Saga Cyborgs Fourth Saga CELL FIFTH SAGA BOOO BOOOAnd please choose some better actors Master roshi is bald u bastards Bulma has blue hair etc etc etcThis director should be banned from directing more movies or at least should have been some organization that protect some stories from being told by incompetent people,Negative
Im sorry But its Dragonball Z Never was a fan as a kid And definitely not now The movie shows it for what it is Haters going to hate Therefore its a solid  Perfect adaptation Hahaha,Negative
Oh yes I remember this highly anticipated film Everyone was impatiently waiting for this especially Dragonball fans When it came out and when I looked at it the disappointment I felt was something indescribable Acting at the amateur level tis very below average All characters are generic without personality without enthusiasm Visible attempts to insert some funny scenes that are not funny at all forced commedy A romantic relationship if we can call it that was inserted purely to exist in the story The plot is characterless uninterestingly complicated and moves too quickly without explanation every now and then lots of unexplained things sketchy with lots of holes in the story The only good thing in this movie is the visual effects I must to admit but thats not nearly enough to save the rest of the film,Negative
"Regrettable attempt to achieve an adaptation according to the tastes of North Americans
Lacking the soul and charisma that characterized the anime nobody within the production seems to have seen any chapter and it shows that they tried to turn the characters into superheroes of the timeThey destroy the characters add a nonexistent love arc in the anime and the action far from what it should be understanding that the effects to achieve it would be very expensive but at least they could have been more ingeniousI give it one star because at least and thats being very kind the main characters wardrobe at the end of the film shows a certain resemblance to the anime and I liked the effect of the dragon balls And that they filmed it in Mexico thats all I highlight about this film",Negative
Honestly I dont have anything to say about it everything is wrong it is an offensive movie and adaptation of one of the most beloved anime everDont watch it,Negative
i had to wash my eyes out after watching this really awful I admit to being a fan of the cartoon and Ive seen every episode but I was looking forward to this film in full knowledge it would not be the same I have to say as a stand alone film it looked like they were just going through the motions The dialogue was childish and the story had been squished into such a short space No time at all had been taken to write a proper story  they just bastardised the original Goku was a white teenage boy for Christ sakethey should have written a new story that just paid homage to the original coming up with something interesting but instead they ruined an already well developed story i think they just made some cheap rubbish to see if they could get all the dragon ball fans to rent it,Negative
Bad scenario bad actors bad fx The person who wrote the scenario has never watch Dragon Ball and does not understand the characters of the best mangaanime everDont waste your time to watch it,Negative
I watched it as I enjoy the dragon ball cartoons and comics and thought it might be interesting despite a lot of negative reviews etc but lets look at it for what it is No its not going to light the acedamy on fire and it is not going to go down in history for deep plot and script writing The movie is fun and when you think of the challenge of bringing manga comicsanimation to live action thats a big task I thought the realisation of the characters was good and the elements they have taken made for good story telling There is life in the movie and the enevitable sequels can get better I will most likely buy on release as it is something fun to watch on a slow weekend afternoon If you want a martial arts epic watch Legend Enter The Dragon or Hero if you just want to sit back and be entertained this is not a bad choice,Negative
The thing that pisses me off is not the fact the the movie itself sucks I mean seriously You could not have possibly expected otherwise The thing that pisses me off the most is the fact that a person like me will spend weeksmonths pouring hisher soul into a script only to send it to Hollywood and have it thrown into the very pile of junk that should have been the final resting place for this flaming pile of human feces Not saying that my work is the best out there But I do know  things  a film made from one of my screenplays would not exclusively have negative reviews on IMDbcom EVEN if it were an adaptation  my screenplay would not insult an entire nation of people not to mention millions of others in other nations Im sure the same thing goes for most other aspiring writers out thereEVERYONE who was involved in the making of this film should really look back on it as the low point of hisher career and use it as an example of what NOT to do Cant possibly find a better example than this one,Negative
I was really tired when I watched this movie and lost the plot but that doesnt matter because everyone on this website is leaving bad reviews anyway I wish Texas Battle would have lived up to his roles in Sexy Urban Legends and Richard Blake should have had more screen time I would give it a zero but Im giving it a  because the dragon balls look cool,Negative
We all love the idea of a real Dragonball movie but dont waste your time watching this After ages of postponing due to the incredible bad ratings i finally came around to watching this but i wish i hadnt The acting is bad the special effects are mediocre at best and the story being told is plain boringThe girl playing Bulma is cute and shes probably the reason i finished watching this horrible movie Shes also the only one that seems to have paid attention in acting school because the Goku character made me cringe minutes in with the horrific showcaseDont watch this watch a couple Anime episodes instead or look up the girl that played Bulma and watch one of her movies Ill guarantee you that either will enjoy you more,Negative
At first we were smiling politely Should have been a big movie so the initial impressions must be wrong Then you think the acting is poor or weird then you notice the dialouge is terrible And in the end the script And the effects Wow this is really a terrible terrible movie And I am a positive guy ,Negative
Without a doubt one of if not the worst movie I have ever seen Whoever made this should be ashamed Please do yourself a favour and never watch this ever Dont even mention it It doesnt deserve that The acting is so bad its not even funny The characters are so far away from the original you would have trouble thinking this is even dragon ball The plot Oh the plot Well it doesnt make sense at all There is nothing from the anime or the manga that resembles this The dragonballs were created by  mystics Um no Goku goes to school No Goku fights piccolo as a teenager Not the first time Goku is in love with chichi He didnt even know about girls until after his gramps died of natural causes There is just too much wrong with this movie I dont usually review movies but this was just so unbelievably bad I had to vent,Negative
Some of the most talented actors are supporting roles in this film I met Mr Blake in Japan at the premiere of this film and have followed his career ever since Also Justin Chatwin is the most perfectly cast Goku there could be This story simply couldve been better,Negative
This movie does not do justice to the anime and neither to the manga James Wang directed this Production must have used him as bait for the audience Pieces of the original story are put together and thrown to the spectators that has to put them together and recompose the picture Lame dialogues acting and CGI Watch something else,Negative
Like most i was hyped when this was released but my god what a load of rubbish this was It gained notoriety in the last few years purely because of how awful it is James Wong should be embarrassed and as others have said the story and character changes were unnecessary Ill be fair and say Emmy Rossum was convincing as Bulma with American sass along with Chow YunFat who added a touch of that famously eccentric EastAsian humor its just a pity nothing worked too well outside of that There was so much material to work with and so many story arcs to choose from and the best they could do was make Goku a highschool kid and turn Piccolo into a generic villain of the week I really hope if ever the remake comes into fruition the movie does a better job and utilizes the source material a bit more,Negative
Legit the worst movie Ive ever seen Everyone involved did a terrible job and it should actually be deleted from society We should delete everything pointing to it,Negative
If there was a way to rate this a  it would still be worth a negative This is such a horrendous movie that holds zero likeness towards Dragon Ball other than a name and character names Aside from those things this has zero to do with what Toryiama createdWith the technology we have these days there should be an effort to erase this from existence and do right by the franchise with a real and legit live action worthy of the Dragon Ball name,Negative
I dont even know where to begin on how this film messed up a great animation series This movie didnt even touch the show in anyway other than the names of the characters  moves This is the worst depiction of DragonBall Fox has to do better Try again get characters that fit the roll And who actually look somewhere near the characters If not that Give the characters their original personalities I think k this was half asked and not cared about at all Total waste of time  money went into this film,Negative
Everything in this movie DOES NOT resemble the real Dragon Ball anime series Dragon Ball is one of the greatest stories ever made yet this movie is not even close to a single episode from the originalThis movie remains me of two other Hollywood made movies based on two beloved video games seriesDouble Dragon and Super Mario BrosThose games are fun they have an interesting story the cartoon series are fun to watch yet the movies suck they are lameIts almost as if Hollywood were intentionally trying to remake awesome series from Asia with the lowest crappiest quality as possible to make them look bad The only thing not added this time was musical intervals with the typical dancing and the singing to add their typical touch of junkAvoid this movie like the plague,Negative
This is like the  Godzilla movie This is NOT dragon ball at all They ruined all the characters They made goku go to school to appeal to the younger audience The cgi is awful Just everything about this movie is a disgrace to dragon ball,Negative
It has nothing in common whit the dragonball animation series Its a totally different universe they just stole some ideas and characters from it and turned it into a ridiculous childish movie Off course dragonball is made for children but in the animation series the makers created a deep and very interesting universe whit extremely powerful characters who combine martial arts whit fantastic powersWhen i watched that series long ago i really wanted to be like those charactersi wished i could make my hair turn yellow while flames cover my body and all the dirt flying up and started spinning around meI was expecting the same feeling from that movie i know its not easy to replicate that but they didnt even tryDragonball deserves a serious movie really based upon the fantastic universe we know from the animation seriesDont bother watching this,Negative
For starters it was a shambles this is the only newish db movie out and people need to get together and do a MUCH better adaptation of this film the only good thing was some of the beams they fire ie effects but fan made films have done better with looks and better action hopefully one day they make a reboot,Negative
Decent enough watch probably wont watch again and cant recommend if youre a fan of Dragon BallI was so conflicted after watching this that I binged all  seasons of Dragon Ball subtitled just to compare it to the source material and this movie is full of message redactedIf I had never heard of anime then this would actually stand on its own just fine It has a stellar cast YunFat Chow Justin Chatwin Emmy Rossum and Jamie Chung good production value energy attacks and action and a relatively good story lineHowever being a fan of the anime this comes dangerously close to being Avatar in its level of infidelity This would have been a great story to put into the Dragon Ball universe but you have to use different charactersIll avoid going on in great detail about everything it left out and just say that its a problem in the design of the movie it wasnt meant to be condensed into one movie its a series for a reasonGive it a watch itll either be a good time or itll at least get your blood pumping a bit,Negative
I love this movie sounds like its awesome I wish it got a better review but by me its a solid  To those who watched it youre lucky I only watched a th of it before my friend turned it off  But its still the best Just like The Last Airbender movie PerfectIt doesnt follow the story of the anime or the manga much which is kind of a minus but its a fine movie I think they need to make a sequel even though this movie was very very underrated As I said could watch barely any of it before my friend just turned the movie off but I might watch it again if he isnt around so I can write a better review But I REALLY REALLY hope you people reading this dont hate me for loving the movie End of review Sorry it was short,Negative
I went into the movie theater thinking this movie was going to be bad but I actually kind of liked it There was a few minor things that I didnt like about it but I thought it actually represented the characters somewhat true to the series I also think that the movie summed up the whole dragon ball series story in about an hour and a half but to be perfectly honest the story for dragon ball really doesnt make much sense either but they did an okay job putting it on the big screen I do have to admit that I probably wouldnt watch this movie again unless it just happened to be on tv and there was nothing better on and I definitely would not buy the movie but it is worth seeing at least once All and all I thought it was pretty entertaining,Negative
This movie is ridiculous to say the least Being a massive Dragon Ball Z fan this movie got me so angry within the first  minutes of watching itI am so ashamed Please if you intend to watch this Dontthis got me so angry and i want to spit in the directors faces they no doubt even watched the series or read it All they did was get the characters names throw in the dragon balls and thats itThey should be sued for putting such a brilliant manageanime to disgraceThe actors were pathetic and didnt even play the characters right All in all this movie was nothing like the series and it makes me sick seeing these actors in future films to come,Negative
Nothing in this film makes sense and I cant believe that the people involved had the audacity to release it and charge people for it The fact that this film exists proves that not anyone can make a movie I am biased with this film as I am a true DragonBall Z fan But I feel that majority of the people who paid to watch this film are fans of the anime Everything about this film is garbage From the acting to the story to the dialogue If you want to know what NOT to do when making a film just watch this The people who worked on this film clearly had no respect for the fans or the amazing story on which its based If you are going to watch it then please prepare yourself for what I feel is the worst movie ever made Doesnt deserve a grade of ,Negative
Its just disappointing Ive got no other words for it,Negative
I just dont get it Dragon Ball has made millions of zenni all by itself from the manga to the animated tv show But this movie directed by JAMES HONG Remember that name cause hes a terrible terrible ignorant person has almost nothing to do with Dragon Ball I just dont get it How could DB be sold out like this HOOOOOW WHHYY My  month old daughter hated it How can I tell that she hated it She watched for a couple of minutes looked at me and said Wow Dad this movie is absolutely terrible Im going to remake this movie and bury James Wong with all the cash that WE made compared to him I wonder how many people killed themselves FIRST FREAKING WORDS MAN I need to go to bed Im very upset these people DID THEY EVEN FREAKIN READ DRAGON BALL James Wong you are going to go to die one day and no one is ever going to wish you back with the dragon balls maybe just to torture you but yeah YOU ARE TERRIBLE The end I HATE YOU,Negative
Yes looking at previous comments on this i would agree but if the film was done exact you would know what was coming next in every part of the film but with this production it leaves you wondering but the main points are there grapha gohan does die goku meets chi chi and bulma piccolo and the ouzaru thing maybe was a bit off but they can easy amend this film with a second bringing in the sayians and young gohan this has got a lot of promise and people shouldnt be looking at a cartoon to match film because do the batman cartoons match the movies no do the spider man cartoons match the movies noo do the xmen cartoons match the movies no it doesnt so theres my point its a development of dragonball not an exact replica and knowing that one of the creators of the anime series are on the production team tells you to admire the adaptation of this great anime,Negative
Knowing that Dragonball and Anime has Millions and Millions of Fans not me Im disgusted how Hollywood ruins their childhoodlove This is bad  from every point of view,Negative
Yeah its that badIts like the writer and director only reference to the source material was a retelling from a  year old Just avoid this no shade to the actors but if you are a true fan of Dragon Ball or new to the series turn back before its too late I recently watched this for podcast work and it was extremely difficult to get through I had to pause step away and take break I usually can find some silver lining in horrible movies but this was asking too much of me I typically dont care for live action adaptations of our favorite childhood shows but this was failed so hard,Negative
Lame female dogs at IMDb wont let me use profanities but the only reason this movie gets such a high rating is because of people who do not know and love the Dragon Ball saga like we do Had to vote  because there is no lower number than that Personally Id vote it a minus  Everything is wrong that can be wrong From how the impersonations look to how they react and meet It should never have come to film This movie is a profanity in and of itself Like to get angry Watch it Otherwise dont Need ten lines minimum so lets review some more Gokus blond and basically human for starters And hes going to school Hes never been to any school until he tries for his drivers license decades after his grandfather dies He grew up in the wilderness with only his grandfather Gohan to guide him There isnt a shred of truth to this movie and theyll probably bar me from posting this but I needed to vent some of my anger at least,Negative
I just finished my review of The Invisible so i thought yeah i should review this tooWhy is it so hard to adapt something to a movie There ARE exceptions a recent case being Sonic the Hedgehog but others like the  Mario film or The Hunger Games just end up being thrashed for often good reasons Dragonball Evolution is not only the worst movie adaptation ever conceived but one of the worst movies of ALL TIME In the history of cinema Granted i never watched the anime but do i really need to see the source material to tell you how bad it is What makes this horrendous is Justin Chatwin He cant act in this It really makes Robbies mysterious reveal at the end of War of the Worlds seem more logical than HOW IN THE H CAN YOU NOT SAY A LINE LIKE YOU MEAN IT AND you dragged Emmy Rossum an actress from decent films like The Day After Tomorrow into this How can anybody sign on to a movie like this There are times DBE tries way too hard and times where it doesnt try at all,Negative
Why use white actors for a Asian role Jesus wasnt white either Hollywood and fake news white washing at it bestTo make a review you apparently have to use  letters So here is how you make a peanutbutter sandwichCollect all of your ingredients needed for this sandwich Youre going to want Peanut butter crunchy or smooth your choice we used crunchy Jelly flavor of your choice we used grape Sandwich bread white or wheat we used white Plates to eat the sandwich on Butter knifeOptional items Disposable gloves Tablespoon for measurementHope you enjoy,Negative
Lets understand most people going to this movie grew up watching Dragon Ball ZXTABCXP or whatever Most followed Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z and loved the characters from Goku to Yamcha Krillen was missingI thought the movie followed the story line as best as nonanimated characters can It is a movie people I loved all the characters the plot Although known and the settings OK the Dragon could have been better and Piccolo was mucked Does look like a Buffy vampire and a few more let me say Directors vision issues But I loved the movieAnyone who followed the animation should like the movie NOTE The marketing team is doing a horrible job promoting the movie on television Say what it is not the garbage I saw on TV The bad promotion made me take time out of my day to see the movie before I start reading the bad reviews from people who obviously did not see the movie,Negative
Awful but im giving it a  because it was not as bad as street fighter the legend of chun li There is no doubt about it this movie sucked but it is so bad its good If you want to enjoy the movie do not think of it as a DBZ movie make believe this movie has nothing to do with Dragon B all Z and only then would you enjoy itWatching this movie with high expectations is the worst thing to can do The only thing this movie has in common with DBZ is the names they use in the movie so dont expected anything you were use to seeing in the cartoon show In conclusion the movie was not that bad when you dont think of it as a DBZ movie but more of a normal action movie,Negative
Full disclosure Im not a fan of the comics or cartoon its seems like a serial in which you need to know all of it to enjoy any of it Much like the one episode of the cartoon I tried to watch with this movie I didnt know if I should take none of it seriously since it feels silly or all of it seriously since the world is at stake The logic is very farfetched and its hard to know when youre supposed to turn your brain off or pay attention to what youre watching so I was lost a few times Overall though I could see this fitting into the movie rotation of a yearold boy However its far too generic derivative and homogenized to be enjoyable to anyone else especially fans of the source material,Negative
Is a clear example of what happens when a project without ideas a lot of money is put For someone who watched the anime is insulting what they did with the story until the time comes that it is impossible finish the movie For those who have not seen the anime is a remix of teen movie ill conceived adventure heroes and villains unconvincing underdeveloped A watchable movie for children under  but if necessary it is better to make them see the original anime before this shame I could write endless tube faults the movie not only in history thats the worst that can happen to a fan of Dragon Ball but the script also poorly developed the actions run down and address unintelligible but it would be a waste of time It is best to pretend that the movie never existed,Negative
Its a feelgood movie maybe not spot on like the original Dragon Ball Z that I grew up with but its worth the watch Goku is portrayed as he should clever witty humble and humorous The fight scenes are more realistic to the eyes rather than being fully edited with CGI and special effects The storyline and character development is wellpaced The only thing that was unsettling is the fact that Bulma looked exactly like Arianna Grande Overall Dragon Ball Evolution is humorous diverse and an enjoyable film in our modern times,Negative
I knew this movie was gonna suck the moment i saw Goku played by the whitest guy in existence However I watched it later on an airplane cause it was free and i had nothing else to do They pretty much ruined the whole series Why they tried to make it modern with Goku being some nerd in high school I will never know I thought some parts of the movie were pretty hilarious because of how poorly this movie was made The only thing I actually like about the movie was Jamie Chung chi chi because shes pretty cute Other than that this is a garbage movie and I pray to god that there is never a sequel to this piece of trash,Negative
The Dragonball series had sooooo much potential to be an excellent live action franchise The series has a loyal fan base and the action of DB would appeal to any movie lover but in order for this to happen the franchise must be handled by people who know what the HELL DRAGONBALL was about This garbage isnt Dragonball this movie is more closer to High School musical than it is to DB You can tell the writers of this crap werent fans of the series because the only similarities between DB and this movie is the Title and some Character names I am not going to place the blame on the actors because it isnt their fault that the writing and casting sucked How are going to have a white Goku Thats like having a Japanese SupermanIt doesnt make senseBut yea dont waste you time with this one,Negative
The movie its really bad the idea was good Its a shame of all Dragon ball Z fans It would be so nice if someone make a proper movie of Dragon Ball Z with effects of Man of SteelAvengersThe Last AirbenderMatrixLord of the Ringsetc it shouldnt be that hard since every decent action movie has acceptable effects its not even possible to take this movie serious I guess all the fans of the Dragon ball Z saga will have a long wait for someone to make a decent movie its the kind of movies its not even worth the time to watch online or something maybe only for support issues Ive watched on cinema and was really a waste,Negative
This movie was actually pretty good a lot better than I was lead to believe by the reviews on this site and others across the net I will admit it could have definitely been betterA few details didnt line up with the original dragon ball anime but there were a lot of things that hearken back to its origins which as a fan of the anime I appreciated One must keep in mind that this movie is based on dragonball not dragonball z I feel that the movie main story is very similar to the original story without just flat out reproducing it And the effects are astoundingThe one major problem I have with it is that the fight scenes arent long enough I say that if your a dragon ball fan you should see the movie and look forward to the sequels which are rumored to already be green lit,Negative
Jesus Christ this was horrible Id rather watch  Death Note than this pile of ,Negative
Do NOT watch this terrible terrible terrible movie The story is poorly told and the acting is even worse I want my time back Who ever came up with screenplay surely never saw ONE episode of the original anime,Negative
I dont know why all this hates floating around for this movie but the thing is pure win Start to finish it captures the essence of the Anime and the emotions I felt when I first watched it like  years ago I felt like a yearold watching Dragonball Z all over again They took all the goofy fighting goofy animation epic plot lines crazy characters and condensed them amazingly from what would have probably been like a million DBZ episodes to a minute film They even had a minutelong charge sceneSeriously dont listen to all the crap on here Go watch this movie and try to be a kid again,Negative
OK so the Movie wasnt great but it wasnt that bad I am a huge Dragon Ball Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT fan I own and have watched every episode I think that you first have to realize that this is a Dragon Ball movie not a Dragonball Z movie Yes its not exactly like the anime but did you really expect it to be First there is no way the live action characters will look exactly like the anime they are real people not cartoons Also as for the fighting have any of you actually watched Dragon Ball it was very comedic in its fighting especially early on in the series Dragon Ball was a long series and they tried to cram it into a single movie There were some missing components in the movie and some changes I think overall it wasnt that bad I know I will buy it when it comes out on DVD Also if they make a sequel I will watch it,Negative
This movie is nothing in comparison to the original Dragon ballDBZ anime if they made a movie out of dbz properly that would be sooo awesome But this one sadly was just awful Piccolo was not like Piccolo the dragon balls werent made that way everything about each character was wrong Goku is much different The feel of the anime is what gives Dragon Ball z that unique touch but I guess well never have that technology to be able to make a good enough movie out of it And they probably think there arent enough fans I think differently as I see how there are  million people who like the facebook page that alone is a lot for a Facebook page and then the word spreads about how good it is and the advertisement should draw people to see it as the tech should be insane as the fights are just Awesome,Negative
I can honestly say this movie made me appreciate the manga I love it but only got into it to impress a boy in my teen years Seeing this god awful movie which I knew would be bad who DIDNT know I want to go back and read the entire series just to wash it out of my brain It feels like they pushed and pushed this movie back and like a school child who doesnt want to flunk by not turning in their project they just threw together something and threw it out there hoping for participation points They encompassed so much into the one movie that they had to leave out all the characters How can you create Goku with no tail and a liking for girls As my husband said Goku thought marriage was something to eat They wanted this movie to appeal to the consumer like every romantic comedy Disney channel production that is processed in Hollywood God Bless the manga,Negative
"Normally I break down my reviews into good and bad sections So lets start with the goodGood
Short runtime  minutes This film respects your time and wraps up its awfulness in relatively short orderBad
Acting The Goku actor feel pulled out of a bad CW high school drama None of the actors feel engaged or like they want to be involved with this messScript Truly awful writing muddled concept doesnt have any idea at all what its even trying to say or doHigh School drama Why is an anime about otherworld martial artists posing as a high school drama movie in the first placeAction  Terrible martial arts terrible CG power effectsIts trying to play itself so seriously as well that you cant even say its a fun romp  camp type movie it just doesnt workI cant even speak to the lore  accuracy as I wasnt a huge dragonball fan going in though I have it on good authority that the accuracy is on par with the rest of the awful qualities of the film",Negative
It would take too long to write My review is too short,Negative
I knew it would be bad so I didnt have any expectations you could say I watched it just for the heck of itand I still regret it so much Dear God it was like watching Power Rangers shooting magic Everything was bad the acting was bad the special effects were bad the storyline was bad for goodness sake it was so bad I couldnt even laugh at it Even if you try to watch it as completely unrelated to the mangaanime its still utter crapI realize that recreating a story from s isnt easy but I just cant understand why they had to make it even more cornyand if youre trying to make it more realistic you should stick to it to the end,Negative
Its a master piece The special effect of the plot the charcters omg this Is the Best movie in the wooooooooorld i think the internet dont apreciate this movie but if you look the new Dragon Ball series and movies you Will check that thats a really good movie the only think that you say wow this Is really strange its picolo design but well you can ignore that because its a great villain with purpose and its not a cat with op Powers AND the fact woho was film un Mxico only says that its a world film AND better that Mxico series sorry but this Is the movie who you really nees to see its a master piece,Negative
This movie is garbage horrible nothing like the anime,Negative
 Dear Dragonball Evolution Why did Goku charge when using the Kamehameha Why wasnt a massive crater were the blast left Why didnt the Dragon speak when the wish was about to be made Why was Goku in highschool Gohan went to highschool not Goku Why did Goku act like he was in pain when he fell against a wall Why was Goku so slow Why did Goku turn into an zaru at an Eclipse And without a tail He can only turn into an zaru if he has a tail or if he is in Super Sayian  Why was Piccolo lying in bed being attended by a Human When he can regenerate a limb in a minute Why did he refer to Goku as a Human Why was he dancing to use the Kamehameha Why did a Kamehameha restore life to Goku Why was he almost killed with one gun shot When he was killing dinosaurs when he was a kid Why did you call it Dragonball when in Dragonball he is a kid Why did you not make Bulmas hair completely blue Why has your director sponsors entire crew and cast not been killed yet,Negative
Oh my god it was really bad it was so bad that is so good I watch it always before,Negative
I dont like DBZ at all so when I was on a  hour plane ride to Greece I thought I could enjoy this as a dumb action movie I was wrong I couldnt get through  minutes of this garbage fire I even tried watching it with the volume off so I can ignore the horrible dialogue but I still couldnt get throught it No joke I just decided to stare at a black screen for about a half hour until I fell asleep on the plane,Negative
"Dragonball Evolution is a comical movie Surprisingly it made me laugh a lot The acting was alright and the story was so messy A lot of the time I was completely confused at what was happening Plus I was not expecting to see Emmy Rossum The only thing that kept me watching was the action It was so amazing I loved the fight scene with Jamie Chung and herself It was choreographed really well Yet this movie in no way reminds me of Dragonball I have never watched it but Ive seen pictures and some videos
If the story wasnt so sloppy this movie couldve been great",Negative
Dont expect the live action movie to live up to the cartoon,Negative
Absolutely terrible if i could chose one movie to wipe off the face of the earth it would be this piece of you get the point Anybody and i mean ANYBODY who appreciated dragon ball despises this movie and for good reason too its terrible The characters are not anything like the show vital things about everyone were changed AND BULMAS HAIR WASNT EVEN BLUE Even if you have never seen an episode of dragon ball z this movie would still be the worst one youd ever see The director was an absolute idiot and this piece of crap has forever scarred the name of Dragon Ball Our fan base has a saying nowadays A true DB fan respects ALL of the series but still hates Dragon Ball Evolution with a passion Do Not Watch This Movie,Negative
I cannot believe that anyone who was involved with this movie has ever even seen the entire Dragonball series First of all why is Goku some white kid with gelled hair They couldnt find anyone that fit that part better really and second I would really like to know why they completely ruined the plot Why did Master Roshi live in the middle of the city why did Bulma not have all blue hair why was Yamcha not afraid of woman why why why did they make this movie there are so many things that they completely ignored that could have been so easily fixed There was no need to change the storyline that much that is why we all loved it in the first place the original effing storyline I am so angry that this movie even exists I think they should release a personal apology to all the fans of the original anime I could have written a better screenplay in my sleep,Negative
First ever review and I waste it on the worst movie Hollywood ever producedThanks for the honourIf I could rate this movie a zero I would have done that but unfortunately IMDB is too kind and do not allow  ratingsIve seen over  movies and this is by far the worstChallenge me,Negative
The music was good and I enjoyed the eye candy But this wasnt DBZ Instead of calling it Dragonball Evolution They could have removed all Dragonball references and named it something else,Negative
To me personally Dragon Ball Evolution was a pretty fine movie despite its flaws if taking it as a standalone movie based on Dragon ball concept characters and elements Due to backlash it received we end up missing out on more DB live action movies for better or worse Some major influencers set the pace  trend of hating it usually under pressure of and to appease loud  proud haters and other people followed just hating it for the sake of hating it like NPC sheeps one after another It wasnt widely hated when it first came out but haters won eventually and shaped the opinions of everyone else,Negative
Here is the original I mean really people the original wasnt all that great httpwwwonemangacomDragonBall It was the fact that it was in your own personal world that you opened up to it in the first place In all honesty the last movie i saw was twilight So with that in mind the acting was great Hollywood actors usually dont get into there powers in these types of movies Although Piccollo did look a little funny but he was borderline The tone was silly and mischievous the same as dragonball If you didnt like it than go read a few chapters of the one above and write a review on that,Negative
The  movies is destroy the childhood of those fans The main characters like ChiChi or Goku its made like just for training the cgi is one biggest problem before Cats the acting and direction kinda like destroy the experience of Dragonball original The story just made more dull and It Hard to mixture all the scene,Negative
I remember seeing this as a kid and I can see issues with the movie before even knowing what it is Im a fan of Dragonball Z probably my number  favorite anime show of all time Year pass and I came to the realization that this so called adaptation film is a piece of utter garbage Heck maybe worst than The Last Airbender at least that film has a simple story from the cartoon series The action is terrible the visual effects is blend as hell the only good character in that movie was Master Roshi everything else is a clich executed horribly If The Last Airbender was the cake this movie is the cherry on top,Negative
Insulting piece of garbage Only simularity between this movie and the true dragon ball series are the names and nothing else,Negative
I think the movie was both good and badI agree that the storyline shouldnt have been changedI know that its very extremely long but the anime has lots of plots that did not affect that much the evolution of the story till the point he fought PiccoloThat part could have been made maybe into the first ten minutes showing more scenes but with connections between themUnfortunately there were too many American aspects to a movie adaptation of an animeI consider that the movie would have done great if we could have seen the cartoon scenes recreated with state of the art visual effectsFor those who didnt watch the anime i can say that its not a bad movieThe storyline is solid but dont believe what you seeIn the Dragonball universethings happen differently better original,Negative
This movie has got to be one of the best adaptations of an anime ever OK so Justin isnt that great of an actor he still succeeds as a teenage Goku and his hair is fine Imagine an actor wearing a giant spiky mess of hair it just would look too goofy Im glad with the way they went with it Bulma was definitely bulma ChiChi was a little off missing her anger issues and Yamcha was kind of lame But Roshi was the Roshi we all remember minus being balled If you nitpick this movie then yes you will be angry but if you look at the movie from a technical side compared to other anime movies this owns I recommend seeing it and I cannot wait for DBZ,Negative
First of all This movie was made for fans of the series so if you arent one then obviously youre not going to enjoy this fairly campy adaption of an old anime series If we all remember that this movie IS indeed a kids film then you should obviously not expect great cinema but innocent fun which is exactly what the film isThe violence is fairly mild but very well choreographed the effects are subpar and the acting is laughable but I didnt mind all of that because this was a new interpretation of a series that I loved as a kid and all the core ideas and themes from the show are still hereIf you can suspend your disbelief and forget about certain large plot holes youll have a lot of fun with this movie If you cant do that then dont bother because make no mistake this is FAR from a good film,Negative
This movie is fking trash It took one of the greatest anime series and straight up butchered itIve seen porn with better acting Nothing was anime accurate it felt like the writers smoked some crack did some molly and jerked eachother off while writing this scriptIf you want to suffer watch it If you love yourself do literally anything else,Negative
can not call themselves dragon ball fans cause if u paid any attention akira had say in this movie and he said it was his new imagining so get over it cause it was a great movie and i hope they do make more ill watch em and buy them all to add to all my db dbz and dbgt dvds so everyone needs to stop being so critical about it cause your never going to get a perfect adaptation of any game movie or book so accept it as it is go in seeing it as a new beginning to a wonderful series and enjoy it and i bet you will see it for the great movie it is then what you think it should be if you want your movie buy a video camera and try making one better then this movie,Negative
"This movie is great probably the best movie Ive ever seen
It has amazing characters
The story is being any other movie and its completely accurate to the original series
It has amazing action and the way the make the characters look is wow
This is the best movie ever
Is what you thought I wouldnt say so oof go oof yourselves",Negative
Well I understand it doesnt have amazing graphic and etc but contentyes Ive watched original dragonball series and loved them was kind of interesting Im not sure why it has such low rating on imdb its not a masterpiece but it really deserves more,Negative
I saw this at the first showing and bought the Bluray the day it was released I dont know why everyone is so afraid of change It was a great movie the acting was good the effects were great the costumes were amazing and the changes were enough to make the story interesting to someone whos read the manga and seen the anime like me A direct adaption would have been boring This version changed stuff around and made it work While its true it could have used a few more characters from the original stuff that still seems like a fairly minor complaint as more characters would just mean theyd have to introduce them which would bog down the movie And to the people who complain about hair color what works in animation doesnt always work in live action and thats a REALLY minor thing to complain about,Negative
Dragon ball evolution do all the things that dragon ball to Dragon ball super cant do it has better soundtrackmusic and the best animation in the powers i think this movie deserve mores than a  instead this should be a  a truly masterpiece,Negative
Dragonball is a great adaptation to a great anime series Im a true fan of the show and I absolutely loved this film I really liked how the characters were portrayed Goku was great he plays a high schooler with chi chi Throughout the entire film they both have a love connection between each other My favorite character was Piccolo The actor portraying him did a great job Bulma plays a tough fearless character really well too Yamcha was good master Roshi was great and so was Gohan The story is basic Goku comes home only to find that his grandpa was killed Goku then realises he must collect all  dragonballs before the eclipse But in order to do that he must defeat Oozaru and then defeat Piccolo The effects were really good the acting is phenomenal the story was great and the character development was really good I hope we will see a sequel I highly recommend this to die hard dragonball fansYou have the power levels of a Boy Scout troop Freiza,Negative
All around I found it to be a Really Creative and Clever take on the story and even an improvement in a few aspects like joining Martian and Piccolo into one characterI would have changed a few things though  the ending a tiny bit to make it more similar to DB I would have had them revive a dead Yamcha instead for example and not have the flying Goku by the end but a powerful well rooted KameHameHa instead  the whole concept of having Goku be the old minion of Piccolo makes no sense at all it would make Goku older than  year old and Gokus grandfather too It would have been better to have Piccolo explain that his old minion died but that Goku seems to be the same kind of monstrosity so that hell become the new minion of PiccoloI really enjoyed it anyway,Negative
First of all not as bad as I thought it would be I actually waited an entire year before finally watching it I am a huge fan of dragonball and dragonball Z and from beginning to end of this movie it brought me back to the original characters and series that I loved I wish it had more fight scenes with powers but they did a good job putting everything together Also the plot followed the series well with only a few minor changes Overall this movie was highly enjoyable and I look forward to a possible sequel You can tell the director really watched the show and enjoyed it each character in the movie have the same essence as the cartoon characters,Negative
I saw a trailer of this film and i thought it looked brilliant and when i watched it it was brilliant it was full of action from start to end and i think the actors portrayed the characters very well If anyone says this film is crap they have no sense I dont see why people have to be so picky with how the characters look This is supposed to be a bit different and it is and it does it well I also thought the special effects were awesome It really is a great adaptation of the manga series I cant wait for the sequel to this film It will be brilliant My mum also enjoyed the film as much as i did Some people can be hard to please,Negative
I enjoyed watching this film saw it at the cinema  times and got it on DVD and still watch it now yer it isnt as great as manga but be realistic people there is no technology on earth that could simulate that sort image I think that did good with this film and i hope they bring out a squeal cause i will be going to the cinema to see it and get it on DVD as I enjoy these sort of movies and the first one was not disappointing in my eyes all you manga fans have to put that aside when you was the actual movie anyway enough please bring out a number  as im a big dbz fan which I heard they were making squeal but I have searched and searched and found nothing to confirm this ,Negative
Dragonball Evolution  Am I horrified when it comes to this film I think not But what I am horrified about are all of the socalled Dragonball fans who are talking like idiots about a film that is exceptionally great Do you know how stupid you sound when you post something like Bulma would have been better if her hair were blue or Justin Chatwin is going to suck as Goku because he doesnt look like himYeah okay  He doesnt look like an animated character Dont be stupid You all are finding the dumbest reasons to hate this title Its either because   This movie didnt follow closely to the original storyline  Characters didnt look EXACTLY LIKE the originals  Some scene had bad special effects You have to give an amount of Leeway for this film  as like other films none are perfectI find the actors performances were at their best and the action scenes were awesome I and other Dragonball fans enjoyed the efforts of the films creatorsstaff Yeah the movie had its faults  but for the most part this flic is a blast,Negative
I had seen the trailers and was not impressed and only went to see it because James Marsters was Piccolo and surprise surprise I LOVED the movie Going to go see it again and have preordered the DVD I had seen some of the TV series but on the big screen with real actors was awesome Dont follow the sheep that were bad mouthing this movie before it ever came out go see it and form your own opinion it has lots of action never bogs down and the story moves quickly James is excellent as Piccolo of course being a big fan of his I would have like to see more of him but he is all the way through the movie in fact all the actors gave top notch performances James IS Piccolo just like he is Spike he has made this character his and what fun that is,Negative
OK I get itThe guy who plays Goku isnt Japanese And the girl who plays Bulma doesnt have blue hair And the guy who plays Yamcha has a dye job And theres no Krillin And Gokus not a kid And Piccolo doesnt have his green antennae And theyre in high school And Roshi isnt a creepy perv But heres the thing CALM DOWNDragonball  the series is incredible not to mention complex And a cartoon To make a movie out of it they had to trim some stuffSo Dragonball Evolution isnt a perfect replica of the series But it does its best to stay true to the material and the charactersIf youre looking for the exact spoton down to the last detail movie about young Goku and his search for the dragonballs  youll be disappointedBut if you want to sit back relax and open your mind to this interpretation I think youll find it enjoyable,Negative
Oh my goodness I could not believe my luck when I saw they were making this movie I nearly wet myself I have followed this series since day one and I am a die hard Otaku It was so like the anime Word from word in some parts The likeness of the characters were spot on I would recommend this for generations to come as a overall animereality classic Its even better than the anime I dont want to tell you anything about the movie but I believe me me and all my ho mies loved it Goku is super hot  Just like the cartoon I loved the love story they incorportated into it It made me misty eyed MUST GO SEE IT  stars,Negative
The movie is so cursed that it made Akira start writing again good jobOk but also the movie is a lot of misinformation in one single place with all the confusion it can physically contain BUT if you consider this movie a big parody it is kind of funny in a twisted way almost like a trash comedy filmSo yeah as a Dragon Ball fan I cannot give it a low rating because it made Akira literally pick up the series not even kidding and also as an anime fan in general this really made producers think twice before picking up an anime to adapt into live action later movies still made some mistakes but they are still an EVOLUTION from this,Negative
"Imagine a completely Mediterraneanwinning genetic high school drama movie before the second half wizard introduces
And this movie is called Harry Potter Evolution that would not be the worst movie in the world but the biggest disappointment in the world
The people who know the book feel kicked and sad because they do not get what they expected
And the people who just wanted to watch a cool movie feel betrayed and bored because they did not get what they expected
This movie is by far the worst thing Americans have done to Japanese culture in this century",Negative
Well what is done is done Im fans of dragonballs series since I was a kid Ive followed the stories from comics to animewhen I saw this Evolution rumors its just like a dream come true for me after long waiting finally Hollywood make it into a big screen movie and then couple of month later woalah the movie is playI watch this with my other dragonball addicted friends after we saw middle of the movie we decide to get out from theater without finishing watch the movie and we playing PSone dragonball game instead that thing makes us forget for a moment weve been disappointed by dragonball Evolution We hope there is another big screen of dragonball and we hope the other time is we watch it we all dragonball fans can have a nice dream in bed and not a nightmare thank youthank you thank youThank you to a new TV series of dragonball named DragonBall KAI that remastered version is PERFECT so we also can forgot the Evolution Phew what a relief,Negative
I would rather let someone curry fart in my face than watch this abysmal pice of trash ever again,Negative
"I regret wanting to watch this movie when I was younger Since I watched it more I came to conlusion that this movie is corny in many ways
 Goku being an angsty teen is unfitting and this would fit Gohan more Minust angsty part Special effects are awful
 Voice acting is boring Writing in general gives me gonorrheaJust watching the rest of the movie feels like MKUltra psyop done by people who want to experiment on others to see their breaking pointIf you want to check out Dragon Ball franchise just read mangas or watch animeAvoid this at any cost I am too bored to give this movie a rating",Negative
This film completely fails to understand what made Dragon Ball special in the first place The characters barely resemble their original versions the story is simplified to the point of being meaningless and the tone feels wrong from beginning to end Even if you forget that it is supposed to be an adaptation it still doesnt work as a fantasy or action movie The pacing is weak the fights are uninspired and nothing feels memorable Its not just a bad adaptation its a bad movie in general and a huge waste of a beloved franchise,Negative
I cant imagine how much the actors mustve been paid to have this in their resume From Swift to Elba JHud to Rebel Wilson Judy Dench even No amount of acting talent could save this sorry excuse for a selfindulgent furry fantasy,Negative
There is a wall in my house The wall is a simple wall eight feet tall and fifteen feet wide it sits in a corner in the basement It has been painted beige with a few coats to cover up the bumps and scratches from coats before Its got its idiosyncrasies the way the light jumps off the paint the not so even drywalling underneath Stare at it long enough and it begins to speak to you  or at least allow you to speak to it Maybe theres something to the wall  or maybe its just my romantic illusions of inspiration and contemplation that bring life to it My point is this  staring at that blank wall for two hours is far more inspiring interesting and enlightening than watching even just two minutes of the cinematic colonoscopy that is Cats A film so awful so ridiculous and so void of substance its very existence is an affront to musicals film and theatre Unless youre a fan of so bad its good cinema stay away This is a watershed moment in bad movie history,Negative
Sorry to pile on but in my  years I have never walked out of a movie until now We had high hopes we love musicals but good lord this was awful on every level,Negative
The most entertaining part of this entire movie was reading these hilariously bad reviews It was SO boring and hard to watch,Negative
In  years this film will have a weird cult following and an aged James Franco will make a meta film about it Until then it will remain universally regarded as an utter shambles,Negative
Honestly I wish I was joking Just everything was completely terrible James Corden was cripplingly awful but thats nothing particularly surprising Leaving the cinema Id felt as if my soul had been sucked dry Avoid at all cost,Negative
This film is truely a masterpeice in unintentional horror The effects are so special Im going to have nightmares for weeks to come Why they didnt just dress the actors in costumes and makeup I have no idea either the filmmakers are lazy  or someone wanted to push the boundries of visual effects Cats pushes those effects right off a cliff into the uncanny valley The design and look is freakin disgustingI never saw the stage musical so I didnt know what I was in for This movie that has no plot its just a bunch of random cats introducing themselves I tried to enjoy it as a sobaditsgood cringefest but the lack of plot and the terrible effects make it impossibleIf you cant even look at the screen without feeling annoyed  disgusted its impossible to enjoy it in anywayThanks Tom Hooper,Negative
Im not a praying man but I was praying so hard for this movie to end From the fist minute I knew this movie was going to be a disaster What a waste of talented actors,Negative
If I thought I had any will to live before this movie destroyed it I went home traumatized my beloved cat of  years was on my bed sleeping and I almost called the adoption center to put her up on their listing I didnt get rid of her but I can never look at her or other cats the same way againRating ,Negative
The most well thought out horror movies ever Youll never ever look at your cat the same again,Negative
Im probably going to get attacked for this but I didnt think the movie was that bad Yes the cats had human teeth but what do you expect when its a group of humans dressing up as cats The singing was great and the dancingchoreography was also phenomenal The cast and crew work really hard and hey if you hate it you hate it but Im just confused as to how the reviews are so awful,Negative
Iit justI cantII got nothingTheatre is theatre for a reason,Negative
This is what Dante saw in one of his dreams also this is traumatizing for children so if you are  or older go watch it,Negative
My body and soul was not ready for what I just witnessed,Negative
"Are we both having strokes
That was my girlfriends review
Still not sure but I think my brain weighs less now",Negative
"Not entirely sure what I just witnessed but man that wasweird
Went in hoping it was gonna be so bad it was good but alas it was so bad it was just plain awful Selfindulgent  oddly even the Alist cast seemed terrible Kids will love it no doubt grownups not so much",Negative
Do not watch this under any circumstances  this movie is a dangerous to your mental and physical health,Negative
Rise of the skywalker im the worst movie of Cats hold my coat,Negative
Not a lot more I can add to the reviews that have already been written The directors obviously thought that by throwing a load of A list actors at this it would somehow make up for its short comings James Corden was terrible as usual,Negative
Cats is incredibly surreal Its barely a movie I dont know what it isNow dont get me wrong it was hilarious The wonky facial expressions lingering songs and downright creepy mannerisms were quite the hoot Almost all of the audience was there to laugh at the movie For good reason There were two people in the theater who were taking it seriously a young couple on a date Oops thats a poor choice of movies but they turned around by the end of the film and started chucklingIts so strange how a piece of media like this can exist Despite how unwatchable it is the movie was weirdly hypnotizing Well I guess we are one with the jellicles now Whatever that means,Negative
"Hyped as the worst film of the decade so much that it didnt seem THAT bad while watching Kind of a reversal of hyping something as amazing only for it to be just okThe first few songs are quite unorganized and Rebel Wilsons song is disturbing at least to me
After Judy dench shows up it gets decently entertaining The dance number after that is good and the absolute showstopper was Skimbleshanks The Railway Cat Jennifer Hudson was Jennifer Hudson She was good If the first half was as organized and taken care of as the second half was it would be much better McKellen was very good as wellLook CATS is a hard show to even sell to a stage audience Its an acquired taste Its not for everyone Some parts cough Skimbleshanks were very well done while other parts sneeze Rebel Wilsons song were atrocious",Negative
"Im currently listening to the original sound track to try and cleanse myself of the film I just saw It was equal parts a bland tedious trudge to get through and a confusing horrifically misjudged spectacle of disaster The tone was all over the place James Corden got some laughs almost purely from the way he seemed to be embarrassed to be in the picture Jennifer Hudsons melodramatic hysterics were more cringe inducing than genuinely emotional Sweeping epic songs are visualised in the most bland and ugly way possible
I spent the whole film feeling frustrated at seeing a bunch of songs I like being butchered Constantly interrupting the flow of a song to simply say a line as opposed to singing it isnt edgy its just worse
The whole thing is so misguided that Im sure even the on set catering was mucked up somehow",Negative
As Phoebe said My eyes My eyes What have I just watched I wish I could get partial amnesia or something and forget this experience,Negative
Just try and make it through just the trailer Then think about how many people in the world could have been helped by that money Think about how many people may need therapy if they manage to sit through this feline disaster I always held Slime People as my nominee for worst film ever made budget was  in  but this has replaced it,Negative
I cannot even comprehend all the negative reviews The animatronics are great and the singing and acting are pretty good Cmon we pretty much all know the story and what to expect THiS IS CUTEIf you dont already know the story well then the movie wont make the actual musicalstory any betterIf youve seen the actual musical or several times like I have then this is a pretty good representation,Negative
I too was once innocent I lived in a pure bright world full of hope In my navety I said surely it isnt as bad as they say Never have I been more wrong in my now Godforsaken lifeI can only hope that whoever created this atrocious disease of a film enjoyed the copious amount of drugs they must have taken to decide this should have been made I would need even more than they were on to make it through the movie again without ending it all in the movie theatre with a plastic strawAlso we need to save Judi Dench from whoever has forced her to be in this cinematic representationr,Negative
CGI mess of a movie with caterwauling stars in ugly costumes and abysmal dance numbers based on the hit Broadway musicalThe movie is ugly to look at and is an assault on the ears with Jennifer Hudson screaming at the top of her lungs and every other singer shown in loving closeup as they mug through their numbers This includes Judi Dench Ian McKellen James Corden Rebel Wilson Taylor Swift and othersReally I thought Hudson was trying to cough up a hairball She should have It would have been the highlight of the film,Negative
"Wanted to see if the movie was as bad as the reviews suggest
It was and more",Negative
Honestly I dont get the hate for this film It was fine Not amazing certainly not terrible Two weeks after release I sat in a sold out cinema with an entertained audience a lot of whom cried at appropriate moments Yes its weird and at times boring because the songs just keep bleeding into each other but overall its an entertaining spectacle that kids will like Not nearly as bad as people have been saying The Mr Mestophalies scene and the scene where she sings memory are the two best scenes You cant fault the dancing performers or most of the singing the sets and vfx are solid for the most part and its actually really impressive technically Its fine,Negative
James Corden seems to have been stuck in the film to appeal to his American following he certainly wasnt chosen based on his acting or singing skills A truly awful film with no one getting pass marks but Corden was particularly dire,Negative
"From the first  seconds of the movie I instantly regretted my decision to give it a chance
My only consolation is reading the reviews of others who have suffered as well",Negative
Worst movie ever So bad my wife left to go shopping,Negative
I love musicals I grew up going to the theater and also watching them on TV Unfortunately Cats was one I was less familiar with No matter what I was still excited for it I watched it the first time and was fairly confused the first half Then once I was in the proper mindset and listened to the words of the music it was beautiful A couple days later I watched it again with a new appreciation and loved it,Negative
I dont understand why so many critics  audience members hated this movie so much I dont typically like musicals but I actually liked this The dancing  singing were great I loved the  leads Victoria  Munkustrap whos faces  dancing were captivating to watch Jennifer Hudsons singing made me cry it was so well done I thought the cgi was actually pretty cool  amazing The only actor bit I didnt like was Taylor Swift Yeech she was bad It was like she didnt even try to move like a cat Dont know why some reviewers slammed that the plot made no sense The plot was actually very clear The move kept me entertained,Negative
The only thing that could have saved this movie Was for it to have never been created to begin with,Negative
This may sound a bit harsh on the movie There are a lot of big names But this is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life There is no plot Taylor Swift is only used as a promotion I dont like giving bad reviews But I have never used my life more stupidly than deciding to watch this film Do not waste your time on it,Negative
I went expecting it to be bad But sometimes bad can be entertaining This was just bad There was no entertainment value in its badness Its like the cinematic equivalent of the Tide pod challenge Many in the theater could not take it and left Those of us who stayed only succeeded in poisoning themselves Not much of an accomplishment I found myself angryangry at the people who made it angry at the people who distributed it It is an indictment of capitalism that someone can sell something this bad and not face imprisonment,Negative
Just hoping all those that walked out asked for their money back Most theatres have a policy about refunding your money if you walk out and ask for refund within a certain time frame as in  minutes,Negative
Ive always wanted to see a truly legendary terrible movie during its first theatrical run The Room wasnt given a theatrical debut in my country I was too young to go and see Gigli and I didnt get to go to the Baywatch either But now Ive done it I got to watch CG abominations vomit on Ray Winstone in a fursuit and that made me very happy,Negative
I went to the theatre with my little brother and when we left he was crying I wasnt expecting it to be this scary but it sure delivered,Negative
There has been an apocalypse Mostly a cathuman hybrid seems to be thriving in the streets of London They cultivate cockroaches for food and are obsessed with their own names as they sing and danceSometimes their faces look weird somehow Its not all the time In fact its only once in awhile but Im fixated with the problem Their human faces dont always match their bodies Even when its done perfectly its inhuman Im going to say the obvious The CGI is unnecessary They are better off using makeup and wear leotards If theyre using CGI I dont understand why they kept the boobs They need to get rid of the human boobs Leaving all that aside I stopped caring about the story I dont know the point of the story It suffers the greatest sin of any story Its boring More than the weird cathuman hybrid or the dancing cockroaches or the horrible jokes this is boring,Negative
I never ever give a  star rating having crawled out of the cinema after this monstrosity I had to give it the review it deserves I genuinely thought I had a migraine as the screen seemed out of focus and distorted everyone else said the same A hideous movie the visuals detracted from the music which was half decent some of the performances were dire I hate to jump on the bandwagon but the worst movie of Excruciating ,Negative
This film is jawdroppingly awful Avoid like the plague No need to critique it So bad its bad Enough said,Negative
"HonestlyI went into this hoping for a trainwreck I saw the reviewsand laughed But this was not what I expected Cats  feels like someone tried to digitize a Broadway production of the play but the computer focused too much on face recognition The choreo and singing feels straight out of the musical no modern hip hop remixes here All the main cats get their own songsand they may just be only introducing themselves and thats itbut theyre all done well and I enjoyed some of it a lot especially the opening number Memories actually brought me to tearssomething that doesnt happen very often
The obvious elephant in the room is the CGI whichyesdoes look freakish at firstbut by the last third I didnt care
This isnt the holiday smash hit the studio was hoping for but when you realize that it is currently going up against Star Wars there is little hope for this to make much of a mark at the box office",Negative
Meowch Ive never seen the stage version of Cats but this movie didnt do it any favors The CGI feline humanoids are nightmare fuelcreeping crawling prancing  dancing though a paperthin plot that drops the viewer in the middle of an unfamiliar  unsettling world without any real explanations Its also full of mostly lackluster musical numbers featuring songs with nonsensical lyrics To put it simply this film is litterally a catastrophe,Negative
I thought i was in a fever dream Nope turns out i was just watching this godforsaken movie that felt like a bunch of Animorph characters that got stopped in the middle of the morphing to a cat and then shoved on stage,Negative
What the hell was that How in the world could Hooper watch this and still release it This goes way beyond weird its downright creepy at times which is magnified by all the bazillion closeups Thats not the way to watch this show You have to see the whole stage because there are things going on all over the stage no matter which character the focus is on With a stellar cast such as this youd have to really go out of your way to produce a monstrosity like this Im sorry to say that thats pretty much what he did I like Hooper Hes put out some really great stuff This is not one of them,Negative
I have never seen the Broadway production So I went in with nothing to compare it to I enjoyed the music and the choreography I thought it was cute and quite entertaining I was pleasantly surprised after reading the reviews and having no expectations The story was adorable and it made me smile,Negative
"Great singing and dancing some of the set pieces are a bit weird
Cast have done a good job
The haters seem to have jumped on a bandwagon frightened to say they liked it in case they are not seen movie aficionados 
Have seen the live musical preferred this ",Negative
Unlike the real world this is a strange world Eliots cats are much more lively and sociable with other cats In fact his characters are so unrealistic that you wonder if Eliot ever even came close to any cats The versification is skillful of course But its still the brilliant songs by Andrew Lloyd Webber music  T S Eliot lyrics Most of the cast are good singers  especially Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy and the new song Beautiful ghosts is alright Nothing EXTREMELY wrong with the film as its just as a Jukebox Musical  it literally exists to attempt a narrative around songs so its fair to say that the soundtrack is better than the rest of the film,Negative
Im not exactly sure what I just witnessed and Im sure my eyes will never recover from it but Cats makes John Travoltas Battlefield Earth seem Oscar worthyHow did the actors and actresses even agree to star in this,Negative
"I mean What was thatis it actually a movie There has to be a plot for it to be called a movie right
Sorry but I wouldnt recommend this monstrosity to any human being",Negative
I inadvertently hammered a  nail into my hand Yet that was more enjoyable than watching this disaster of a movie The special effects the story the actorsall so so bad  but would like to give a negative score if I could,Negative
To all current and future high school bandtheater students Enjoy your mandatory viewing of this for years to come,Negative
After hearing so many negative reactions to the film I wasnt holding out much hope for the film However I was very pleasantly surprised Really enjoyable watch The singing was beautiful The ballet wonderful The CGI wasnt as odd as described and within  mins I was very used to the cats appearance Really nice film with a beautiful story,Negative
Without a doubt the worst movie of the decade James Cordan was eye rolling bad and the best cat in the movie was seriously Taylor Swift,Negative
I took my  kids to watch this movie as they left in horror they had night mares about his movie for  days straight it was so horrible they actually started crying in the theater,Negative
Normally I enjoy to watch movies that are so bad theyre good CATS is next level bad There is no humor found within this monstrosity,Negative
Bogus good reviews abound on this movie  all you have to do is check to see if the reviewer ever wrote a review before and then ask yourself why they would choose this to be their first amazing review You have to assume the studio paid for those ones because they needed to have some good reviewsThis movie is peppered with stars so youd think it would be good CGI has come so far so youd think that would be good too But somehow it just added to how terrible this isThe CGI is awful The script is awful Some of the songs that were great on stage are somehow awful The blame lies with whoever decided not to animate this and went with CGI insteadI have never seen so many famous names in a cast and thought wow this was a pile of poopWait for it on Netflix for free its that bad And there were only about  people in my showing and  of them left and never returned Thats how tragic this movie is and its a great musical on Broadway just so NOT in this movie Its a razzie contender for sure,Negative
I went into this film with very low expectations But this film is worse than terrible Theres nothing nice you can say about this movie It just isnt worth watching I felt bad about spending money to see it,Negative
I am writing this review as I am still in the movie theatre room and the movie isnt finished yetThe most disturbing thing for me is how obvious the green screen is I cant stop starring at their feet They didnt even try to make it look a little real No depth of fiel nothing This just makes all the dancing and moving so unnaturalSome songs and voices are good but the overall movie is just really bad I wanted to leave after min but my mom paid for the tickets and I dont want to be disrespectfulI dont think this should have ever been adapted for the big screen Because of all the reasons above but I also think its just too theatrical and just doesnt adapt well I have no doubt this would be x more enjoyable played on a Broadway stageStay away from this movie,Negative
"Well everyone who likes the musical will like the movie cause the music is the same And yes its about cats
Cant understand any wrong expectations about that Most underrated movie ever",Negative
Its Andrew Lloyd Webbers Cats  what did yall think you were going to see Its a strange musical with a strange premise with strange characters  why would the movie be any different It was true to form The musical numbers are fun and dramatic The cats look weird but thats to be expected considering its a bunch of adult actors playing cats Enjoy the music and bizarreness of it all  its kind of fun Additionally Jennifer Hudson is phenomenal She didnt have to go that hard but she did and we should be grateful,Negative
It is listed as a comedy because it is indeed a joke,Negative
People are dramatic The movie is a solid  Ive seen much worse The thing that makes Cats flop is the songs Theyre not catchy besides see above and the cats sing the entire movie They shouldve transitioned some of the songs that actors essentially spoke to dialogue The choreography was pretty good and the sets were colorful but the CGI flopped too Overall had potential but not much worse than the original,Negative
If there is such a place as kitty heaven then we must assume there is also a kitty hell If such a place were to exist the demonic entities that would dwell in such a place would resemble the screeching nightmare inducing creatures featured in cats  Im not entirely convinced this was not the intended purpose of this musical flick as no sane person could have thought any of this looked goodright,Negative
Its worst than game of thrones ending Its worst than game of thrones ending Its worst than game of thrones ending,Negative
Do not watch this horrible film Save the cash for buying the Joker movie,Negative
This is one of the most well thought out horror movies After I watched this I had a deathly fear of cats for two months I would recommend it but not if you have a cat,Negative
I dont tend to write reviews but felt it necessary on this oneFirstly other than knowing  songs I knew nothing about the story for Cats I soon realised about  mins in that there is no solid storyline and perhaps it translates better on stage than the big screen However I loved it The performances were amazing I loved the dancing and J Hud was outstanding I was sobbing by the end Its just one bizarre musical number after anotherSecondly the CGI really isnt as awful as people are making it out to be Some bits looked a little off but it wasnt distracting at all In fact at times it was glorious to look at The set designs were beautiful and the way the actors moved was captivatingI can see why people may not like this movie its definitely not to everyones taste but its not a bad movie by the time you judge talent and direction I think its the lack of story that makes it hard to follow,Negative
"Doesnt mean you should
Wow
Horrendous film absolute dross",Negative
Id have rather sat next to someone who had no control of their bowels n farting for  hours then to have sat thru this horrid  strange  creepy  weird movie The music was hands down freakin aweful and painful to endure  what a steaming pile of dookie,Negative
Please can people think before making awful films that each bad film will take resources from the environment so no more sh films,Negative
The movie is simply horrible The CGI gives you the creeps,Negative
Its hard to believe a movie can be THIS bad with a  million dollar budget Theres a lot to complain about but the worst part of all was the writtenin song that stuck out like a sore thumb I wish I could forget,Negative
Cant even explain how bad this movie is so heres an emoji of a sad cat ,Negative
This Movie Is An Insult To My Four Amazing CatsI had to go home and apologize to my cats for the infiltration of cat related garbage that I just allowed into my brainThe only two good things in the movie were the face makeup and Jennifer Hudsons version of Memories which you could see in the movie trailerSeriously  The Best Parts Are In The Trailer Just watch that  spare yourself  hours of your life that youll never get backMy husbands favorite part was when they all blew up in the end but then he realized that he dreamed that when he fell asleep during the movie and that was an even better ending than what we just watched,Negative
"This film is based on the smash Broadway musical and I thought it stayed fairly true to that show as I remember it So going in knowing that I enjoyed it Lots of reviews saying theres no plot not true There IS a plot albeit a very simple one The cats are vying for the chance at a new life by being chosen by Old Deuteronomy Judi Dench at the annual Jellicle Ball
I will admit there were a couple of weird moments like when Judi Dench raises her leg in the air after watching Gus the Theater Cats performance played sweetly by Ian McKellen But I thoroughly enjoyed all the performances the dancing and the singing Jennifer Hudson performing Memory as Grizabella will make you tear up I dont care who you are
If you are a fan of the musical you will probably like this movie If you know nothing of the musical you should probably acquaint yourself with it first otherwise none of it will make sense and you will think its just weird
I liked it",Negative
I saw Cats at the New London Theatre in the early s with the original cast and was blown away Wayne Sleep even sat on my lap during one scene I was smitten My parents bought the gatefold vinyl and I grew up singing the songsSo when I heard it was being made into a film I was dubious How can you recreate the glory of a stage musical like Cats And then it was released to such bad reviews and scorn I really didnt know if I wanted to ruin my memory of the showButit really isnt that bad Yes its weird in places but I honestly dont know how they could have made it more realistic  its about singing catsI loved hearing all the songs again and I enjoyed it Worth a look if you are a massive fan of the show,Negative
Just awful and the blame falls squarely on the Script and Director Except for Ian McKellen there was absolutely no interest or connection between audience and characters The movie had no heart and there was no reason for us to like the characters The poor actors had to work with bad choice after bad choice The studio shouldnt throw any more money at this flop to fix the GCI Thats not the problem,Negative
Absolutely terrible I could only sit through about  minutes,Negative
Im kind of wondering what people were expecting This is pretty much a CGI  Cats with a few weird additional changes some pacing that could have been faster and some less impressive vocals But honestly I dont understand what was so upsetting Has anyone seen the original It makes very little sense to begin with Its a musical about Cats that has honestly defied all logic for decades anyway If youre a fan I feel like you got what you were expecting It was FINE Not great not awful Fine My biggest complaint was Jason DeRulo robbing the Rum Tum Tugger of literally everything that made the song and the character what it all was but other than that calm down Seriously This was not the worst  hours Ive spent in a movie theater this year I can name  movies that were more painful,Negative
This is the worst film I have seen in a long timeAnd why is the idiot Corden in this  he cant act and is just a smarmy waste of space  even in this terrible movieThe film is like a giant vanity project  loads of cash thrown at junkDont waste your time or cash on this,Negative
Horrible CGI  terrible performances by actors  weak storyline  total waste of money and time,Negative
Went home and apologised to my Cats after watching this abomination stars for the laugh I got when Ian McKellan went meow meow meow,Negative
I used to have a standing order for a monthly donation to the cats protection league Ive cancelled it after seeing this they should euthanise the whole sorry lot of them,Negative
No this wasnt Broadway Nothing can outdo that This was a movie projection of the Broadway play with a complete set Broadway is like reading a book and it becoming your imagination of what the set looked like This is how Andrew Lloyd Webber saw the set The main character is a ballet dancer in London And one of the guys is a ballet dancer and tap dancer in London I commend them for their talent especially his tap dancing skills You could tell he had been tap dancing from a very early age WOW Jennifer Hudson singing Memories was excellent Her singing is so soulful Taylor Swift sings Beautiful Ghosts and I enjoyed it very much I enjoyed it very much but you have to go in watching it as a movie not a broadway play Two very different things,Negative
"Although I am a big Broadway musical fan and have heard the soundtrack of Cats many times I never knew the full plot It was nice to go into the movie being familiar with the songs Since I was familiar with the songs I did note that some songs were not what they could of been but overall they were very entertaining and even moving During one song I started off a little disappointed but by the end of the song enjoyed it very much At a few points near the end I got emotional and had chills The plot line was very understandable for those who have never heard of it
If you enjoy musicals dance numbers and Broadwaystyle solos the movie is worth your time It was a movie I would watch over and over and recommend to friends Actors did a phenomenal job and obviously Jennifer Hudson was amazing Quite a few new actors who did a wonderful job as well Excited to see where they go in the future",Negative
Im not sure Ill ever recover from seeing Ian Mckellen SIR Ian Mckellen drinking that cream,Negative
Damn this was one of the best musical spoofs Ive ever seen I literally laughed so hard i couldnt catch breath Good jobThis is by far the most grotesque thing Ive seen and Ive seen a lot of sick movies,Negative
This could be the worst thing ever made who thought this would be a good idea Is there still time to delete this film,Negative
Never seen it as a musical but can see it might be better on the stage Remember George Galloway in Big Brother as awkward as that So wrong No story  people of  in the cinema left after  minutes the rest of us stayed to see if it got better it didnt,Negative
Tom Hopper has become the most snobbish filmmaker with an Oscar He now makes films that sound like people pleasers and sure things when the cinema is about emotion and guts Dont adapt Broadway musicals read Andr Bazin or take a page from Damien Chizelles book This remake tendencies that we are seeing suck if you really have something to say or do with an adaptation do it but dont rip it off and prentend well enjoy it like the real thing not even if you cast Taylor Swift or Jason Derulo ps BS,Negative
I just went to see the film adaption of Cats  I think it has to be one of the worst films Ive ever seenThe film itself was largely devoid of storyline and frankly quite boring The visuals were nice but overall it was gaudy The choreography was OK but the vocal performances were questionableThe CGI and the movements of the actors was interesting but only for a few minutes The way the cats moved varied throughout the film walking on two feet or four feet and I noticed a few errors in the sizes of the cats compared to their props  sceneryAll of the sung parts seemed to be recorded dry without any acoustics appropriate to the setting of the scene which really spoiled the realism for me Sounded just like the actors were in a vocal booth two inches from the microphoneSeveral people walked out of the cinema halfway through and I dont blame them I stayed until the end in case it got better but it didnt,Negative
So so so terrible From acting to singing to plot it is all so horribly bad BUT the worse of all is the CGI and use of technology It doesnt even come close to looking good Things float and move around mostly their feet that it looks so laughableI recalled that I had heard it was bad but that was  years ago I didnt remember the what or why was bad about Heck the world experienced the COVID pandemic a few months after this movie was released Anway I received free HBO for the weekend saw this and decided that I had to see it for myself I wished I wouldve come to IMDb to reminded myself about the bad the comments and reviewsIm not making a joke here Im honestly surprised that HBO is even showing this still If any of these actors have any kind of selfrespect they would demand that this film is never shown again Stay away far away Wear a mask and dont get contaminated by this show,Negative
Not at all as bad as the critics said Sure its not like watching the musical but the singing and dancing is very good The characters are a bit one dimensional but they are from a book of poems for goodness sake Judy dench has her lovely screen presence in it Its a perfectly watchable translation from the film given a bit more explanation than the stage play I prefer the mungo Jerry number in this to the musical In short Watch with an open mind and not based on what the critics say,Negative
I wasnt expecting much I have never seen the musical I have heard the song Memories but thats it All of that said I thoroughly enjoyed this movie Jennifer Hudson was incredible The other stars were almost as memorizing for me  although keep in mind I am someone who used to dance and could watch hours of ballet without boredom Well done,Negative
They spent a whopping M on this crap Tuneless musical based on a Broadway show and starring computer generated fur stuck around the faces and bodies of some actors singing too loudly The original choreography was dumped in favor of what the CGI could produceThe major critics have all lambasted this bomb and the awards season has pretty much ignored it Even Judi Dench couldnt squeeze a good mention out of any of themCritics have said the sets are ugly and the CGI flying bodies go all blurry Even the closeups of singers faces framed in CGI fur go all wonky if they move Its like a series of auditions in closeup or even worse cat night at your local karaoke barMost of the actors are blessedly unrecognizable but Ian McKellen Idris Elba Rebel Wilson James Corden Taylor Swift and Ray Winstone are all in this backally mess,Negative
Me and my boyfriend went to see Cats whole heartedly ready to enjoy it Cats was a mistake It is an affront to the people who created it We walked out just over an hour into the film People arent exaggerating about how bad it is Its THAT bad,Negative
"Okay so I love musicals and cats the animals Never seen the musical I went into this movie with a VERY open mind Let me tell you this film was dreadful in absolutely every respect
There is zero storylineNO character development I dont actually think there are charactersThe CGI is appalling and overusedThe songs are forgettableThe dancing is CGId for the vast majority of the filmThe singing is spoken with the exception of  bars of Memory the highlight of the movieThere is no development of anything just one song straight into the next song with no explanation of where the plot is going or whyI have NO clue what the film is actually aboutI watched the entire film with my hands over my face and almost feeling angry for putting myself through it A truly bad movie",Negative
I dont know why this movie was ever made and I dont know who the movie was made for Because the jokes are so stupid I dont think kids would laugh at it Just dont bother,Negative
The Emoji Movie was a terrible movie But Cats takes the cake for the worst movie of all time Like if we compare them both together The Emoji Movie is a million times better The Emoji Movie while obviously a big waste of time at least had some funny moments and decent voice acting for the most part It also didnt make my eyes bleed from the CGI Cats on the other hand has no redeeming qualities Trash music and story as well as disturbing and nightmare fuel cat people,Negative
The movie theater was pretty full And about  minutes in it was full of sadness You could tell people were getting angry After about  minutes I couldnt hear the movie over the crying yelling and one guy was even howling Three older ladies beside me took out lighters and lite themselves on fire They just kept screaming Were free were free We all stormed to the front counter to get our money back Ans what do you know they just had cardboard cut outs of CATS sitting up front They were just toying with us So we did what any logical person would do we went out side and started punching cats,Negative
Absolutely nothing made sense in this movie Every visual aspect was nauseating and an absolute waste of great talent Jellicle zero out of jellicle ten,Negative
Went to see cats without seeing the musical or knowing the story Not much if a story though Once you get over the actors being cats you can appreciate that is is a film with dancing and singing which is done very well Jennifer Hudson singing memory is outstanding she can bang out a tune I would say go see it with an open mind and you may well enjoy it,Negative
I think this film is overrated I had high hopes going to see this film because the musical was good but it isnt good when you have the entire movie just singing about cats I didnt even understand what a jellical cat was and I found it really annoyingTheres no plot to it and I wish it had some kind of backstory or at least some drama but it was terrible I was bored out of my seat and waited for it to finish It was so boring They wouldnt stop screeching their voicesIts like that film you watch and you forget about for years like some nightmare,Negative
They originally had a concept for a D animated film that looked amazing Instead they went with this,Negative
I never saw the Broadway show and did not know the story ahead of time I already had my ticket before reading the reviews I do not agree with the reviews of it being garbage and I am not sure why people said they were waiting for an orgy There was nothing sexual about it The cast was very talented but my opinion of the movie is that it was extremely boring The costuming of the heads and faces were very unique and it was all a bit strange looking especially the tails but believe me there are a lot of talentless garbage movies out there this was not one of them,Negative
Help i think i have a ptsd but i gotta say its the best advertisement for cat adoption,Negative
"Who thought it was a good idea to make this 
The Idea of combining cat and human with CGI is terrible and all those cat humans looks like an adults stuff of nightmares Never mind for children",Negative
Given that the original stage version of Cats is complete rubbish I have no idea why anyone would expect a movie version to be any better,Negative
I actually got sick from watching this Or I already had a fever I dont know,Negative
We loved the broadway musical so decided to see CATS the movie We saw the reviews and went in with low expectation Guess what we enjoyed it People say they liked the musical but not the movie due to the music It was the same music except for  new song and the music for one song changed but the words were the same I didnt want it to end and wished they had added a few more songs The visuals were amazing and I loved the little mice Also glad that they made Victoria the new cat to explain what was happing which I had to do for the broadway musical Yes it was different but it was suppose to be,Negative
I got a case of cat scratch fever watching this hairball of a movie,Negative
The biggest monstrosity of the year malformed and melted computer cats dancing via cgi with blurry legs and no feet its like they spend all the budget in the biggest and overrated stars like Taylor Swift and James Corden by the way the worst in this movie My God Andrew Lloyd Webber needs to sue universal for this garbage,Negative
Cats is a once in a lifetime movie not since the legendary birdemic have I been so absolutely bamboozled by the cinematic catastrophe that is this film,Negative
They ruined the original musical This iconic piece is now trash in theaters Music was not good either,Negative
Just a fun fact if you ignore the stupid plot and the scary ps faces and focus your attention on the feets of the characters especially in the background you can see that the cats hover along the surface Im pretty sure me and my friend saw a background character glitch out Anyway a surreal experience,Negative
"People all say that this is a garbage movie
But I think theyre also forgetting that there are ranks within the garbage movies
And THIS movie is king of garbage movies Jellicoe cats uniteThe writers knew what they were doing and Im proud of them",Negative
"Yes the cats look a bit freaky Some things are made for theatre and this is certainly one of those things The acting  singing is wonderful unfortunately the cars sometimes look terrifying
Worth the watch",Negative
This is absolutely stunning This movie shows how far movie makers can go wrong im literally astonished couldnt believe this movie is real until the end Kept asking myself is it possible is something wrong with me am I dreaming or maybe im still dreaming that makes more sensehats off to Tom Hooper so I can throw the hat at him,Negative
No waste you time paying to see this movie no even if when get out on digital o dvd Get the Musical DVD version and enjoy CATS,Negative
But really love the musical this movie is such an disgrace,Negative
A awful film to watch will give you a headache and some brain damage,Negative
"Wow Now I understand why people sometimes give  to movies Like what was that It was so unnecessaryuncomfortable and lame I couldnt even understand plot Every cat singing about being cat It supposed to be something that would catch audience in  Also comedy genre Is this for seriously
It was so bad Now I will have nightmares after watching this",Negative
But its technically a bad musical So its actually a pretty decent adaptation and Ive seen the musical too The appeal of Cats is the songs and the musical numbers and the movie did right by bothThe musical numbers were terrific and the big name singers all delivered And most surprisingly there were some really weird visuals that left me with my jaws agape Crazy My body was ready for anthropomorphic cats but it was not prepared for well i wont spoil the craziness All ill say is that Ive never seen anything like it,Negative
Loved this movie and most of the songs The CGI was mesmerizing The actors and performers in this movie should not have been ashamed I finally saw it and I loved it,Negative
I dont normally leave reviews but in this case I couldnt resist there is so much hate on this film I grew up on seeing cats at London theatre and loved it this was a good representation of cats the ending was a bit weird Definitly worth a watch if you like the original cats,Negative
Ok I know I am not the only one wondering why they decided to make the remake of this Play on Broadway was awesome this Not so much Between the border line weirdos in the audience claiming to be furries this should be rated nc just for that How many neutered crotch shots can we see in one film sorry cats but you are for the dogs,Negative
I didnt see this sober and neither should you I repeatedly thought I was tricked into watching hours of video game cutscenes,Negative
People have been overcritisicing this movie like if all movies need to leave a legacy for humanity You can simpliy go enjoy the music and disconnect Nothing in the movie is real like Star Wars either so stop criticising the humanlooking cats Jennifer Hudsons interpretation is outstanding and the cast of singers and dancers do a great job Francesca Hayward is lovely as Victora James Corden however looked a bit disconnected from the character and was two much James Corden The story goes fine until we have seen about  of it and goes down turning too slow then it manages to recover to have a decent second part I dont regret it Maybe its because I like musicals,Negative
"This does not translate well onto film
First half didnt care what happened to anyone wondered if this would be the first film I walked out of
Second half became more interested in the characters and the vague storyline Things that I hated
Jennifer Hudsons weird beard effect
Jennifer Hudson crying through the whole film sing the damn song and stop with the gurning
Ian McKellen lapping out of a bowl
Judi Dench singing Love her hate that someone said sing it Judi
The balloon ride What The Hell
In summary the stage gave it the magic on film its just weird and cringey",Negative
Rarely does a film come along that feels like a cultural misstep of epic proportions but Cats  is undoubtedly one of the worst movies in cinema history Its not just badits a baffling cringeinducing spectacle that somehow manages to fail on every conceivable levelThe CGI is nightmarish creating grotesque anthropomorphic cats that are neither charming nor believable The storyif you can call it thatis a nonsensical mess of disconnected musical numbers with no clear direction or emotional resonance Even the cast which boasts an impressive lineup of stars seems uncomfortable delivering performances that range from awkward to downright embarrassingFrom the unsettling production design to the lack of any coherent artistic vision Cats is a disaster that defies explanation Its not just a bad movieits a cinematic trainwreck that will haunt audiences for years to come This is the kind of film that makes you question how anyone involved thought it was a good idea Cats isnt just a flop its a monumental failure in the history of filmmaking,Negative
So Im picturing the following scenario Idea gets pitched to studio exec gets greenlit based on success of some other recent musicals Star is Born Bohemian Rhapsody and whatnot goes into production OK so far I can understandBut at some point SOMEONE must have seen the dailies right At that point it was not too late to shut it down or maybe go a different direction What went wrong at that stage,Negative
The songs are great as are the musical numbers Jennifer Hudson Jason Derulo and Taylor Swift all sing and purrform their rears offOnly negative was a really creepy Idris Elba who almost looked like he was going to hang cat dongBut as i hinted at in the title the film sounds great and has some pretty visuals It also has some crazy surprises in it that Ive never seen in a movie beforeIt wasnt a good movie But then again Cats isnt technically a good musical either Its all about the songs and musical numbers And the performers here all delivered,Negative
Total embarrassment just because you can do something doesnt mean you should I can drive with my feet doesnt mean its a good idea,Negative
Just the think of the professional cast and the high budget that was poured into this film made this joke even funnier  for making me laugh so strongYep Reviews on IMDB were right I needed to verify it myselfIts like watching a long commercial break with cats promoting different products and wishing the break will be over as soon as possibleFor  minutes its pretty funny After that not so much Laughs are replaced with a feeling of torture I would play this movie  times to my worst enemies,Negative
Wish I could review the reviews It seems theres an incredible critical bandwagon built on reviewers who expected something other than humans weirdly pretending to be cats If you dont like the theatrical version and have never read the poems then you probably wont like it If you know and like both then youll appreciate the movie It couldve been better especially with more dancing but the music stays true to the Broadway and West End classic and the newly injected plot is a nice and slightly cohesive add Its fun nonsensical and a pleasant way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon,Negative
People are hating on this for no good reason The performances were great and the dancing was exceptional These are some of the principal dancers from the Royal Ballet people If you are a dancer or a fan of dance you will love this movie If you hate musicals and dance why did you watch it to begin with,Negative
I am far from an expert on musicals and my singing and dancing are subpar but I thought Cats was ok Not this movie but the playmusical whatever its called with real people on a stage This abomination gave me nightmares and I am an old dude The story music and acting could have been amazing but no one will ever know because visually the entire film is like a million fingernails scratching slowly down a million chalkboards It was like Gilbert Gottfried singing the most beautiful song ever the song itself is still good you just never know it because it is dressed in the worst visual effects ever And James Corden how is he a thing He isnt funny his voice is the vocal equivalent of the visual effects of this movie I would rather put leaches on my eyeballs than be in the same universe where this doucherocket exists,Negative
The only thing good about this movie is a couple of the songs which are you know not original The reason I give Cats a  and Not a  is that I found some of the songs enjoyable Even if they were reused Bleh go waste all of your  lives Cats,Negative
Dont have the words to describe it You just cant unseen it,Negative
I left halfway through Most terrible movie of ,Negative
Thought this would be atleast hilariously bad spurred on by the terribly hilarious reviews but I assure you the witty reviews are the only entertainment involved with this film Disjointed dull and just generally horrific I felt like it would never end Particularly scarring somehow even more so as the rest was the sight of Idris Elba as a cat something burnt into my eyes now nightmare worthy,Negative
Let me make it short this is the nastiest disgusting nauseating loathsome sickening nauseous movie made in the history,Negative
If you watched the trailer and couldnt tell that this movie would be a steaming mug of garbage juice then its your fault for going to see it I gave it  stars instead of  because at least they tried to warn you,Negative
There were sparks of entertainment but not enough to to keep my interest A few audience members walked out I struggled not to follow,Negative
"You can tell the true stage performers in this There is great singing dancing and acting by them There are  or  of the tvfilm actors that let it down a bit
The costumes look like they have come straight from the theatre performances which I love
If you were expecting a movie then you will be disappointed If you are expecting a stage show XL you wont",Negative
I wasnt planning to see CATS today but the theater I went to played CATS instead of the movie I played to see I did not see a Broadway production of CATS but I have seen it performed live in my area and did not care for it at all Today I was pleasantly surprised I loved the characters of Mr Mistoffelees and Victoria I thought Rebel Wilsons cat was very well done For the first time ever I got the sense that there was a story and I was able to follow it Im glad I saw it and hope lots of cat lovers get out to see it,Negative
Thats literally all I have to ask What the hell did I just watchThis movie is a disaster The CGI leaves a lot to be desired the soundtrack is ugly and the plot is completely altered from the original play,Negative
I HATED the musical on stage when I saw it in  There was little plot most of the songs sucked and I was bored The movie has some of these issues but I ended up sort of liking it The makeup on the people wasnt that bad and everybody could sing act and dance Also there was some startling set designsit certainly LOOKED great I almost did walk out about  minutes in when a number with singing mice and tapdancing cockroaches Im not kidding started up but I stayed It got much better after that Most of the songs were unmemorable but I loved Mr Mistoffelees and of course Memory Also Jennifer Hudson was superb in her role She sang Memory so beautifully I started crying So its not a great movie but its certainly not the bomb people are saying it is,Negative
Title says it all Whoever thought this idea would translate well into real life had the thought whilst high on DMT or something Fantastic stuff if you enjoy terrifying nightmares and waking up in a cold sweat,Negative
"Never have I seen anything this bad Shame on you hooper
If you still have to see it  pack  loko per head because  is not enough",Negative
This movie is just god awful its boring and the cgi is just pathetic i would rather burn in the deepest circle of hell for eternity than watch this movie one more time god if you want something actually entertaining read the reviews on this movie because theyre worlds better than this movie i am contemplating receiving surgery now to remove my eyes because of this movie,Negative
"Not even a large can of tuna topped with catnip could fix this atrocity
A few safety tips before going into the theater to see this
 Plant your entire face into a bowl of bleach keep your eyes open its worth it trust me
 Buy a box of cotton swabs soak them in gasoline and then shove as many as possible into each ear until you cant fit anymore then use a lighter a match will do and light both ends
 If you survived all of this and your still seated at the movie repeat steps  and  as needed",Negative
Watched this with an open mind after reading reviews but can honestly say i thoroughly enjoyed every minute a must see for musical lovers,Negative
I have to preface this that I never saw the Broadway musical or previous movie I had no idea what the story line was I was just expecting a musical about cats So why the horrific reviews I dont always love musicals The songs in these were somewhat weird I only knew of the song Memories But I thought Francesca Hayward was cute and very watchable as well as Laurie Davidson and Robbie Fairchild Loved the dancing and the sets We go to movies to either learn something andor be entertained Did I learn anything No but now I know what Cats is about Would I see it again No Was it terrible No The dancing the sets the cat acting and the weird story line  it was entertaining and visually impressive,Negative
Have seen worse I didnt fall asleep which is a good barometer for a film Didnt like Jason Derulo sp but I dont like his vocals anyway also not a fan of Rebel Wilson or James Corden The main chorus parts were fab ie the stage performers and even Taylor Swift did a fantastic job Jennifer Hudson did murder Memories though and I wish I could un hear it All in all Id rather watch this again than have to sit through Avatar which IMO is the worst film EVER,Negative
I dont know what cats is exactly it a movie yes but it seems like my sleep paralysis demons were hoping onto the silver screen one Taylor swift uncanny cat stare at a time James corden is testing my limits again and everyone look like they crawl from the deepest pits of hell itself I hate everything about this it makes me icky and not in the good way,Negative
All of the above This is amazing fetish driven furry clustermadness the word i wanted to use i cannot masquerading as a movie while being a furry play you should keep your kids away fromIf you as an adult decide to brave this amazing assault on humanity you may very well find it superbly gouging your brain out through your ears as you crawl in any direction seeking refuge from the brilliance of this productionThis epic blockbuster is basically when somebody makes a casting couch movie for furries and tries to market it to the masses as something anything other than that It is still a casting couch movie but without the couch or casting so it gets a family rating because kids love cats right right right people Aha Yes i dont think even furries liked it,Negative
The higher production values needed for film reveals this as an extremely thin and clotheared musical The arrangements sound thin and the choroid dull Some startling bad performances by the star cast Judy Dench and Ian McKellen excepted Its amazing that this actually got released Who did they think would like it,Negative
Normally when I fall asleep during a movie Im gutting and have to try to figure out what I missed However on this occasion as I woke up and realised I had missed perhaps half an hour of Cats I felt a huge surge of reliefIts so rare that I feel nothing from a movie absolutely nothing,Negative
Look at your cats litter box for hours and thats more interesting than this dumpster fire shame on you Hollywood,Negative
I actually thought I was under the influence of some kinds for the first few minutes but once the weirdness subsided I actually enjoyed this I saw Cats on stage when i was younger and have always loved the characters and songs so for me it was good fun and self indulgent Just take it for what it is relax and enjoy,Negative
This movie is up there with the atrocities of fascist dictators through out history Got free tickets to itmade it  minutes I would have rather had a colonoscopy performed by a sneezing horse,Negative
Why Just why Its for real or just a joke Worst and boring movie ever,Negative
"Pure garbage thats all you need to know If possible I would give this movie 
",Negative
I would rather drown in a fire than watch it again,Negative
Absolutely no one asked for the movie version of The Uncanny Valley,Negative
The acting was poor and the cgi was even worse It amazes me how a film with budget that big looks like the film has been run through with a snapchat filter Would not reccomend,Negative
Why How Nope How WhyThat is why I prefer anime cat girls over this furry nightmare,Negative
"I dont really get the poor reviews that Ive seen I wonder if its to do with expectations did they not realise that the film is sticking as close to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rices staging and costuming as the director felt fit I didnt really mind the CGI of the actors faces maybe it was thought that something like that would be demanded from todays audiences or was it just that Taylor Swift and Idris Elba couldnt dance But for me it was a minor thing and didnt interfere with my enjoyment at all There were only  things that Id have changed someone should have got Jennifer Hudson some better crying eye drops as her runny nose was offputting and Idris Elba as Macavitys fur could have done with being a tad longer as Idris Elba looked as if he had no clothes on but no bits as it were 
I would absolutely recommend this for Cats fans if youre not familiar with the show then a little research will help enormously",Negative
I guess haters gotta hate It took a few minutes to get used the cgi fur and odd physical movements but I was surprised that I liked the movie It made no sense in any rational world but it was fun to watch The Dancing was lovely Judy Dench can save any movie and she and Ian McKellan certainly brought the needed grounding this movie needed James cordon and rebel wilson were great as well as were the lesser known main characters Overall better than the screen adaptation of Phantom,Negative
"Its really hard to describe the experience of this movie without phisically flinching
Even ignoring the baffling special effects awkward acting an horrible attempts of humor that not even a psychopath would find funny the movie is criminally boring in every level nothing actually happens and when it looks like plot is developing it stops for another painful musical number with songs that in all honesty were never really that goodThis movie misses the mark on every filmmaking level that to call it a movie is an actual insult to the art form itself Makes you actually feel sorry for movies like Sharknado that in their mediocrity at least can be called movies",Negative
I took my little sister to see this movie and my mother and I were uninterested from the start I didnt like the music It didnt make me laugh The graphics looked so weird on the actors its was distracting My mother was ready to leave before the movie ended It was just a terrible movie all together,Negative
I dont know if this beats out star wars as the worst movie of the year but it certainly has fueled nightmares for some time This movie was sickening,Negative
I would rather spend  to listen to a cat moan outside in the cold all night Were the producers high on cat nip to green light this film,Negative
I mean theatre is performed live for a reason Watching a two hour long theatre bit from a screen is deadly boring The lack of adaptation to film format is unbelievable Not to mention the hilariously bad CGI leaving these characters looking like Thomas the tank engine But there is something wonderful about seeing bunch of Hollywood a listers floating heads in this atrocity Like how did such a massive budget movie go SO wrong Hilarious,Negative
"What was the director even thinking 
I feel pity for producers",Negative
I was very tempted to walk out half way through the movie It was just terrible Everything about the movie I am stunned that anybody gave this pile of garbage more than  star,Negative
It may well have worked on stage but not on screen Self indulgent actors with too much cgi its comical but not funny,Negative
"Reading the slating it gets on here makes me think that all the  stars reviewers have never seen the Cats before Its always been a marmite production but for true theatre lovers its an epic representation of TS Eliots poems The film brought more of a storyline to the show and the additional song slipped in nicely Personally I found Jason Derulo disappointing and although Judy Dench was good in her role I would have cast Brian Blessed as a nod to the original west end production of nothing else than his wonderful performance of The Addressing of Cats
Id say dont listen to the haters give it a go with an open mind you just might love it if so then you live the theatre production even more",Negative
"This was just what I needed just before Christmas The perfect escape from stress
Me and my partner went to see it Im a huge musical fan He isnt but we both enjoyed it
Yes it has its flaws I couldnt get my head around the fact they had human hands and some had shoes on But if you have enough imagination it is fantastic and the dancing is just brilliant to watch The stars were definitely Jason Derulo and Jenifer Hudson who made me cry with her wonderful voice",Negative
I wish there was a score i could give lower than one Me and my friend were the only ones in the theater,Negative
Grostesque fanciful interestingly repugnant yet I cannot look away Perhaps one off the biggest disappointments in Cinema history,Negative
I didnt have very high hopes after seeing how creepy the cats looked in the trailer which is just as well seeing as the movie would have crushed any high expectations It was an unfortunate few hours of my life that I wont get back Also Hollywood please stop casting James Corden,Negative
This movie scrared me more than all other horrofilms together,Negative
Do you know the video of the beaver screaming If I could put that here trust meI would Ive thought about gouging out my eyeballs with a rusty spoon after watching this May god have mercy on our souls and anyone who found this movie enjoyable I hope this movie doesnt cause the actors and actresses that were worthy of better movies to be damned for eternity for voicing such a horrible movie God help us,Negative
Only went to see this movie because my friends wanted I thought it would be tolerable to watch as I got see Jason Derulo run around in a skin tight suit Turns out they neutered him,Negative
I went into this blind I really liked it They did pretty good with the effects I liked the tails and ears Jennifer Hudson Judi D and the Magic cat guy and the cat who played Victoria and the other main cat guy LOL I cant remember but I loved the whole cast Idris was just okay I am surprised ppl are giving such negative reviews JHud needs an award I want to go see the broadway play now With all that being said I still like dogs better,Negative
Terrible CGI terrible songs terrible shame Theatre is theatre and film is film sometimes a bad idea is just that bad Save yourself the heartache and leave this one alone,Negative
I get what they were trying to do for this movie but the execution was frankly horrifying The look of the cat costumes kept drawing me out of the movie and full into the uncanny valley Say what you want about the music and the songs the costumes and how everything was scaled to the actors being cat sized just didnt workThe stage show was much better See that if you can Avoid this at all costs,Negative
Hands down the worst film I have ever seen I almost feel asleep at the beginning but didnt thats my biggest regret,Negative
This movie is beyond horrible I dont care if you liked the  broadway show Cats the musical should of stayed in the s with grunge Dont waste your money at the theaters and dont waste your money at redbox either This movie is definitely a never watch on Netflix kind of movie,Negative
I just wanna know the person or persons who green lit it and gave a whopping  million to make this movie You can send all the kids of a small country to college with that money The CGI is just terrible  minutes into the film and you wanna get up and run into a wall or the projector in this case Do not waste your money on this I hate my friends who made me go see it with them Ughhh Worst movie ever,Negative
This should not have been adapted into a film I really dont known what they were thinking Just because it works as a play  doesnt inherently mean it will work as a film ,Negative
Genuinely a horrific film full of questionable directorial choices but it makes for such an entertaining night at the cinema Didnt stop laughing Awful Worth seeing,Negative
 Family Members wanted to see this and I was one of them Wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt but omg I should have listened to them We all left the theatre not even  minutes into it,Negative
If you like the Broadway show you will likely enjoy this movie The Broadway show is a string of catchy songs with some dancing and very little plot This is no different Dont expect a story Expect to be entertained The movie builds on the Broadway show and does what is meant to do entertain Dont expect oscar winning plot lines Critics need to be aware of what the movie is working with before they hammer it The movie is well done It exceeded my expectations,Negative
Im not a fan of the original stage musical Cats and not so keen on the music but this production is very watchable Im confused why so many people rated it so low Give it a chance,Negative
Awful adaptation of a classic musical Shame really could of been amazing,Negative
Some people left before the movie was over wish I would have Horribly done,Negative
"Worst movie ive ever seen Borderline unwatchableNo plot
Almost no script except songs This is ok for this type of film if the songs are good They arent
Poor CGI
Poor acting
Dreadful forgettable characters i dont even remember any of their namesEssentially its a terrible version of Rocky Horror Show that has human cats instead of men dressed as womenThis film has no positives aspects whatsoever people were laughing in a bemused way when the film ended Ive never seen that reaction in a cinema beforePS Cats are my favourite pet",Negative
I nkew that I funny its the best movie ever and its better than avengers end game,Negative
"It also doesnt deserve such a low score Ive not seen the theatre production and I dont think I will be the songs just felt like the same songs and nothing made an impact apart from Jennifer Hudson doing Memory
There were some parts that was just cringy and Corden and Rebel felt like pointless comic relief
Dont get me wrong I love Judi Dench and Ian McKellen but I dont think they can sing and for a movie that is basically one bit song they didnt work for me
The CGI was good in most parts of the film but there was some parts where their faces didnt match with the heads and one part where Mckellens eye just looked wrong I have no idea why or how Anyway a far from Purrfect film Dam it",Negative
The purpose of music is to incite emotion Musicals have long stirred emotions over the years Cats is one of my favorites If you go to the movie with ridged expectations of the broadway performances you will be disappointed However if you go with childlike wonder you will be blown awayI have been brought to tears several times The casting was near perfection Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella and Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy couldnt have been betterWatching my teenage sons glued to the screen was priceless This is a movie that will be added to our digital collection when it comes out It is well worth the money to see it in the theaters,Negative
No no no and no I was unlucky enough to be dragged along to a pre screening of this absolute drivel I cant find anything redeeming about this film Its cringy beyond cringy Dont do it You will waste nearly  hours of your life if you go to watch this that you can never get back and you might be mentally scarred for life It is really that grim,Negative
Family  people  Ladies were somehow satisfied Final scene cats in Trafalgar Square were lake Brexiters around old cat Better dont waste a money and time,Negative
I watched it with really low expectationseven with lower expectations its far worse the I ever imagined they introduce every character with f song wont say all song where bad but have at least some sinsible plot where u can indrodice character in good way I mean wtf Also it has lot of cringe moments which audience wont know what to do sit there and ripe part they her screen or take headache medicine or last option walk out well thats what I did after suffering from headache from this dont what to saytrash,Negative
If I could rate this movie a  infinity rating I would absolutely ZERO story Nothing just soulless singing Compared with the original Cats musical this is  of the quality acting was crap and not because of the cast but because of the way it was presented Always got interrupted bad visual effects BIG problems with scale The cats wore as big as a car or as little as the thickness of the railway NONSENSE BORING We wore literally so bored that we almost fell asleep in the cinema and had to leavedon t waste your money on this,Negative
When I got home from the theatre all I could do was cry for there was nothing to do but cry This movie is the reason time machines need to exist so we can go back and destroy the man who thought this movie could be a good idea,Negative
If there is one thing I would wish to unsee it would be this movie I was prepared for it to be bad but thought it could therefore be somewhat entertaining I was wrong,Negative
Worst movie ever made its insane Im assuming the few good reviews of this movie on here are from people who worked on the movie What a waste of money and effort,Negative
This is not the stage show It is a musical film with singing cats If you do not like the sound of this why would you want t see itOn the other hand if you want to see some well choreographed and well filmed dance sequences with fantastic songs you are in for an entertaining couple of hoursThe film looks good and the humanesqe faces on the cats does wonders in expressing emotion The cast is generally excellent and their enthusiasm helps invest in the charactersThere are some misssteps along the way Interrupting some of the songs disrupts the rhythm Some of the SFX dont work well and a couple of sequences dont work to wellCats succeeds non the less in being highly entertaining and memorable,Negative
This movie is boring and disgraces the name of the original Cats What made Cats on the Stage amazing is that the makeup and dancingballet was real They were actually doing every lift and pirouette you see as well as convincing acting and costumes that are believable In this film you will find bad CGI where there faces look like theyre floating over a head With CGI anyone can be a ballet dancer Its filled with weord back and forth casting Jason Derulo is an abysmal Rum Tum Tugger but Sir Ian McKellen is a great Old Gus Jennifer Hudson has no weight as Grizabella but James Corden is an alright Bustopher Jones Wait until its free on Netflix or something,Negative
Why does this exist dont see this movie please save your money and dont see this,Negative
The only thing that remotely saved this terrible excuse of a movie was the wonderful animation The movie was so bad they brought in all these bell ringers Taylor Swift James Cordan but yet they can hardly sing at all Poor excuse of a movie The only good song was Mr Mistoffelees Save yourself the time and watch Sheep and Wolves,Negative
Ive never left a review for anything in my life but please pay heed to these reviews Its a god awful movie and please save your money And time by not watching Actually hurt seeing some quality actors involved in this production Only a  as  wasnt an option,Negative
Bunch of people should get fired over this garbage,Negative
"But thats what this movie makes them to be I know they got the same director but please they are all miserable and make us feel that rats and racoons are way more fortunate and frivolous
If you think the most anticipated song of the whole show Memory  could do no wrong after a long torturing waitingtime It went terribly wrong and disappointing but I only expected this  minutes to be ok I expected nothing more This song sung by Jennifer Hudson had got to be good Wrong its the worst moment of the entire movie it was way over done its NOT a stage show its a movie but the director thought he did the sad sappy thing in Les Miserables and  lets repeat history again and no need to build up her character 
And then the makeup costumes choreography   way way way TOO SAFE
Especially the choreography I would pay double of what I paid for this movie just to watch a dancescene of a Bollywood movie
I should have just stayed home and listened to Barbra Streisand and Barry Manilow singing Memory  over and over again",Negative
We went to see this movie despite the reviews Cats has always been one of my favorite musicals Ive seen it  times on broadway This creation was a pile of crap left in the litter box The songs were crap and the acting was worse We had to leave after they destroyed mongojeri and Rumpleteasers song Just save time and money and stick needles in your eyes Ugh hated this movie so much,Negative
My favorite review of this movie so farIf Dante had seen this movie he would have included it as the th circle of hell,Negative
Ive got to say I was really apprehensive about watching this after reading reviews as cats is one of my favourite musicals ever but I absolutely loved it the production the effects etc were all brilliant Now I went with my partner and his daughters who only thought it was OK but theyve never seen the original or watched many musicals So my review is if youre a big cats fan like me then youll love this if youve never heard of it before today or not seen the original then youll not enjoy it as much,Negative
It is not easy to move a stage musical to the screen And I think it is very creditably done here The singing was well done too I did enjoy this effort,Negative
I went to the theater to please my girlfriend and did not expect anything I was sadly disappointed tremendously Yes that did the trick for me Now I know what is officially the worst movie ever created Just what is this Why Why And it is not even over please please make it stop This movie should be properly classified as a violent crime against my eyes and ears not to mention against good taste in general I guess I do have to admit that the costumes the set and props as well as the CGI artists did a wonderful job but God why did anyone think this was something worth creating Does anyone taking part in it seriously thing that it is good Really Even if Movies are only created for money nowadays and real cinema is dead I demand to be paid for watching this instead What a tremendous heap of garbage this movie is cant even be put into proper words,Negative
I dont normally walk out of movies but this I had to its very confusing and the storyline is not clear what so ever I understand its a musical but its song after song and the dialogue is very minor The CGI is weird looking and I just couldnt watch the whole thing I had hopes for this movie but it really wasnt very good,Negative
At Cornell University they have an incredible piece of scientific equipment known as the tunneling electron microscope Now this microscope is so powerful that by firing electrons you can actually see images of the atom the infinitesimally minute building blocks of our universe Reader if I were using that microscope right now I still wouldnt be able to locate my interest in this movie Thank you for your attention ,Negative
This is what happens when you do crack and have too many late night project approval meetings DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE Let Hollywood know this type of mediocrity is not going to be accepted paid for or viewed I was dragged to it by my theater friends of friends and have no black ballad them from all entertainment decisions for our groupwow,Negative
I love cat YouTube videos which is what I was doing instead of this cat woman disaster ,Negative
"Its this kind of film that piques your curiosity because it might just be so bad its entertaining in a cheesy campy way Except its not
Go and spend  hours on something with more suspense better character more entertaining value like watching your toenails grow",Negative
Its a bad musical So it mosf definitely should not have turned into a movie,Negative
My  year old daughter threw up  minutes in to this movie I cleaned up the theater floor and she wanted to stay to see the rest Honestly the movie was just as bad as seeing it performed live but at least it was only  for  people instead of ticket,Negative
Im pretty convinced that the entire cast and crew had never seen a cat or a movie before making this,Negative
That was  hours of cats introducing themselves That may be what people sign up for if they go to see this movie but I went in blind Judy Dench looked like the cowardly lion My friend went out as soon as they started introducing railway cat  minutes later after a while he came back and they were still introducing railway cat The cgi was any longer than  seconds of personcat facetime was very very unsettling It was pure awfulness with lots of talented people trying their best to make it watchable and the director still managed to fail You should go see it ,Negative
From Rebel Wilson missed every high notes I was telling myself next session might become better Till the Jennifer Hudson I still hoped she could save this movie from the deep somehow but Im wrong I was totally disappointed never expected this happened,Negative
On the bright side of this movie When Im feeling down I remember at least I wasnt involved in the production of this mess,Negative
HBO Max has CATS as one of their featured movies They should hide it in their Lurking Terror section,Negative
This is the most disgusting movie I have ever watched,Negative
Why are they allowee to make money and films like this That was so awful beyond comprehension The cast was terrible and especially that silly late night host He needs help,Negative
"THEN you will get good films
Swift Corden Rebel list goes on theyre all horrible at the craft of acting and it showed",Negative
One hour and  minutes you have to wait to hear Jennifer Hudson  Will this become a Star Wars Christmas special that is only seen once in the world,Negative
I just want to know who thought this movie was a great idea when they represented it ,Negative
Pathetic Absolutely pathetic DONT waste your ,Negative
I love movies and this is the first movie i fell asleep to cause it was that boring omg they never spoke a single word for the first  minutes all they did was dance and sing and i didnt really get the concept of the movie James cordon and rebel wilson were so funny tho other than that the movie really sucked and its a one star for me,Negative
It was Christmas hanging out with the family all of a sudden the trailer for the Cats movie came on and everyone stops talking and watched the trailer which was actually pretty epic and then at the end of the preview my Grandma said that looks terrible and I just burst out laughing,Negative
Authorial intent Entertainment value Commitment of cast and crew Sheer originality Whatever you pick Cats succeeds Its a vile  disturbing sera preteen Photoshop job cometolife a catscratchfeverdream of a movie that you dont so much watch as it more justsortaHAPPENS to you a jawdroppingly brilliant bit of incomprehensible nonsense whose depths must be plunderedeven if each trek comes out gloriously empty the journey is always glorious,Negative
I thought can a film possibly be as bad as what people were saying the answer is yes this film is absolutely dire in every sense The cgi human cats are disturbing The deep sense of embarrassment for the Alisters and James Cordon was the cherry on top,Negative
I sat through this two hour movie and I still dont know what its about All I know is that Jason Derulo got salty on twitter bc the animators smoothed out his cat bulge Sorry buddy but theres probably not a lot there in the first place,Negative
A long running Broadway play with multiple awards An A list cast What could go wrong Apparently absolutely everything I have already wasted too much time on this film to waste anymore typing about it,Negative
I mean what else can i say i cant remember laughing so much at something being so bad if youre in for a laugh this is the film for you,Negative
I finally understand the hate this got Theres no story literally just singing throughout of which didnt look good even had mistakes in multiple scenes I hate musicals like this especially where its just singing and barely any regular dialogue Im pretty sure the bulk was bad CGI too,Negative
Honestly this was one of the most appalling films I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing Sure Talyor Swift had it coming but Idris Elba I absolutely admire it is tragic to see such talent being wasted on someones unoriginal trash,Negative
"Ewwww this movie is horrible
Sorry but not sorry",Negative
WHAT A PILE OF crap There was a tone of mistakes and where there was meant to have paws there was the actors hand I only watched it for  mins and ended walking out it was they bed DO NOT go and see this movie,Negative
I couldnt even make it through the whole film Its literally torture to sit through and watch this garbage,Negative
Five of us three of which children walked out half way through the film it was awful it did not make any sense it jumped from scene song and dance so fast if you watched it taking a bag a magic mushrooms it might of worked but one of the worst films Ive ever watched,Negative
It felt like and endless subfebrile hallucination at  Celsius with the ibuprofen not kicking in yet,Negative
As a tribute to the dreadful tunesmith LloydWebber it was a perfect career ending debacle  for a weapon of mass destruction Even if they had a sudden urgent tax bill to pay I cant see why some serious star performers didnt sue their agents for even suggesting they might appear,Negative
This movie just sucks  plain and simple Why why why was it even made,Negative
I still cant figure out why this exist to be honest I see some reviews scratching their heads as to who exactly this merveille was targeted towards The best i could come up with is furries But furries dont dress like this and i doubt theyll pick Sonic over this pretentious shambles for being overtly pretentious,Negative
PLEASE DONT DO WHAT I DID AND BE TEMPTED TO SEE THIS FILM SURELY THE REVIEWERS MUST BE WRONG I THOUGHTNOPE SPOT ON ITS IS AWFUL,Negative
Given the all the negative reviews from users and critics I wasnt expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did I have read TSEliots Old Possums Book of Practical Cats twice And I have seen the stage musical  or  times in the s and loved it But a movie gives you closeups of facial expressions and feline interaction that is not visible on a live stage The music was as I remembered with a few additional songs and some spoken parts to help the narrative The actors dressedCGId as cats is no more unexpected than they were on stage I dont deny that people who are not at all familiar with the book nor stage production may find the appearance of the cats to be unusual and the songs somewhat disconnected However I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it and watch it again,Negative
I read the reviews for this film because the rating was so bad  at time of writing The reviews were so bad that I had to watch the filmI was very surprised this film isnt bad at all In fact as far as stage musicals transferred to film go it is good better than good even I think the problem is that the reviewers that gave this  didnt actually understand what they were watching Its a fantasy musical its supposed to be fantastical As for the reviewers that said there is no plot or story Cats doesnt have a plot or story because its based on a book of poems about different cats,Negative
Who could have predicted a film starring James Corden Taylor Swift and Idris Elba would be among the worst of the decade,Negative
Im still speechless Who approved this final cut And how much were they paid The only thing that was even slightly good was Jennifer Hudsons climatic performance at the end but it in no way redeemed this movieI got in the car and my friend and I just looked at each other She asked what did we just watch My reply only the worst movie ever I want my money backPlease Dont go Just dont do it Spend that money on a good meal,Negative
Never walked out before half way through a film but my daughter and i were bored and disappointed,Negative
Star studded casts do not equate to be a great movie Especially the Broadway musical play turned to be movie can be disappointing to someone Back in s Betty Buckley perfected Grizabella in Broadway Tough act to follow once someone perfected and branded the role Her version of memory still gives me a chill and makes me cry Also Broadway casts of Cats were in shape back in s I have that version embedded in my mind and Im sure many people shares same sentiment,Negative
No plot Horrible CGI No character development No suspense No antagonist No protagonist Just a bunch of random garbage and terrible CGI so bad that it was the cheesiest thing Ive ever seen I really dont even know what that was supposed to be,Negative
Nothing short of a self indulgent waste of time completely forgettable,Negative
 Well its based on Cats See I thought that by some stroke of genius the horrible source material would make something good Or at least so bad its good This is actually worse than the play,Negative
Watching humanoid cats rub up against each other for an entire hour and half was extremely uncomfortable There was little to no plot and where there was plot it was lost in chaos and disgust There are multiple misplaced silences of heavy breathing and scathing stares JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME COMEDIANS IN THE MOVIE DOESNT MEAN IT IS FUNNY The jokes have poor timing and dont fit with the movies theme Also the cats are creepy and their clothing is inconsistent,Negative
Many who are not familiar with the Broadway show or staging might not understand the structure of the show This could explain some of the negative comments I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the performances were great Highly recommend this whimsical tale,Negative
"I thought the film was perfectly fine as entertainment the song and dance routines were great the direction cinematography scenery etc was rather pleasing
Ive never seen the play or the even heard the story so for me the whole affair was enjoyable maybe the hate is because the film has not done the play justice For me its an ok watch",Negative
At least Ishtar provided a few laughs I cant begin to understand the thought process Its horrid The biggest problem was the CGI for the fur ears and tails of the performers REAL Cats dont look ANYTHING like these creepy beasts Ears moving randomly and tails looking like awkward phallic objects Idris Elba doing a soft shoe and singing Jennifer Hudson NOT SINGING WELL I wish brain bleach could erase this movie from my mind A horrid awful mess Every aspect of this movie was terrible Survived the cinema experience barely,Negative
Ive seen bad campy bad historically funny bad but this is plain old bad Even for free there is no redeeming reasons to watch this movie,Negative
The musical was never about a story but rather the experience and the cats What type of movie do you get when you focus on a nonexistent story A bad movie Everything that made the musical enjoyable and special gets completely ruined I love the original but now Im ashamed People who didnt even know the art it was based off of already have a bad opinion of it and are scared to look at the original Its truly shameful Now time to burn my Misto cosplay,Negative
Save your time and dont see this nightmare that is Cats,Negative
Utter garbage No plot rubbish CGI rather like watching cats on your lawn,Negative
Couldnt do it I walked out the first  minsWhy sis the directors think this was a good idea,Negative
Im seriously considering putting my cat up for adoption after having seen this film because I can now never look at a cat the same way again I I Im just horrified,Negative
First of all its a musical Theres supposed be more singing than dialogue I think everyone from Elba to Hudson  even Ian M  did a very nice part in their roles And I dont see how yall think actors are creepy when they used the same tech for the Naavi of Avatar and they are supposed to be acting catlike hence where the set has to be larger than normal and the name of the musicalmovie  Unless you thought the Naavi were creepy too And no Im not bashing Avatar I loved that movie and yes its better than Cats I am just talking about the black suits with the cameras so they can capture the actors movements and facial expressions while they add the CGI To each his own though I guess Im the horrible cat for liking this more than the rest ,Negative
"Well Im going to give this a moderately positive score because I enjoyed it for what it is  a movie version of a stage musical which is based loosely on TS Eliots charming stories I was accompanied by a neighbour who loves her own cats and we had both seen the stage musical many years ago The production uses CGI to enhance the costumes and movements of the human cast and I think this works well The performers are clearly still human beings dressed in cat costumes which seems to be a look that some reviewers cant accept I presume that some of the negative reviewers might prefer cartoon animation but I reckon that what this movie does works well
It isnt Tom  Jerry or James Bond or Star Trek or romantic comedy or of any other conventional genre This is a different kind of movie and I suggest for a different kind of audience ideally catladies who have seen the stage musical at least once",Negative
Ive seen the first scene of the movie in my nightmare beforeit was bad and boring and i paid fifteen dollars plus popcorn and i think it was the first movie i watched in theatre all year,Negative
Cats is one of the most interesting and awe inspiring films Ive ever seen The way it uses music to brung out the best in its cast is okay now that the mods arent reading this movie sucks hard It just keeps introducing things concepts and characters and then inevitably you get confused and forget everything that gets introduced immediately after,Negative
I hated cats afrer this movie  Zatar can make better cast than this,Negative
What did I just see That was all that went through my mind after walking out of the theater with tears of blood streaming out of my eyes This diabolical misuse of CGI and AList talents is so evil that its hard to believe no one turned into a pillar of salt looking at it Like most real cats I just dont give a damn,Negative
I too was first confused when I first saw this movie Its horrific Its terrible Its down right creepy at times And then I realized its just under the wrong genreCats is the best psychological thriller of our timeThe plot focus around a ritualistic killing in a cult from the point of view of a new comer and through glitchy special effects and just straight weird mumbogumbo becomes one of the best psychological thrillers of our time,Negative
"Absolutely awful the best bit was the credits
Someone should have let the dogs out this is one of the worst movies I have watched if you do watch it just remember you wont get that time back",Negative
First time for me to leave the cinema room in the middle of a movie Thats how bad it was,Negative
I went to see this  without seeing any of the reviews and loved it went back again after reading the reviews and still loved itI have seen the show The original London cast then again in  and then again at the London Palladium for the revival The film was different there were aspects added not the same as the show But for an entertaining evening its excellent some of the performances are excellent Jennifer Hudson Judi Dench Ian McKellen Francesca Hayward were wonderful I have never liked Rebel Wilson and would have preferred someone else in the part I loved the fact that the dancers were dancers Please support this film Its great ,Negative
Tbh i would rather burn my money than watch this movie I never expected to see anything worse than the live action aladdin or worse than the old live action sonic film but here it is nightmare fuel,Negative
I only saw the trailer but it scarred me for life,Negative
Its like they tried to make the movie as odd as possible to see how long viewers would last The cats human feet will haunt my dreams until the end of my days,Negative
I watch a LOT of movies this is by far the worst movie I have EVER seen This movie is packed with celeberities They should be ashamed of themselves and deny ever being in such a disaster The songs were boring The plot was non existent I couldnt stop thinking about how bad it was for hrs after watching it If someone gives you a free ticket still say no,Negative
"I am actually in a drivein double header watching this right now It is the first movie so nobody is driving out but people have left their cars and nobody is watching the movie
Thank the Lord for smartphones
I loved Les Miserables but Tom Hooper needs to apologise for this",Negative
When someone tells you not to see a film dont waste your time going,Negative
Do not waste your hard hearted money on this trash,Negative
My mom raised me on musical Andrew Lloyd Webber Rogers and Hammersteins etcwhe went with my aunt the both enjoyed it immensely My mom cant stop saying how captivating the sets and stunts were The music was so beyond anythingshe said Jennifer Hudson gave her goosebumps when she sang My aunt was in tears My family thinks this was amazing,Negative
"Its a shame to see all these extremely negative reviews that are presenting this film as if it is the bloody emoji movie Theyve clearly not seen the original which is just as bizarre and slightly confusing in a good way It is not striving for a crystal intricate plot it is artistic in choreography music set the use of CGI  not straying too far from the original but has added in a clearer way of seeing the story and wonderful casting and a beautiful new song Jennifer Hudsons performance of Memory was extremely emotional just as the original
Not only was it beautiful it was entertaining generating frequent laughs and a constant interest
People should see appreciate and praise this film",Negative
I only watched it because I felt I needed to see it to believe how bad it is I didnt hate it anywhere near as much as I thought I would but it was still pretty terrible I was going to give it a  to try and be slightly positive but I couldnt think of a quality that would be worthy of a  rating so just stuck with  James Corden is the worst Jason derulos English accent is almost as bad as don cheadles in Oceans  The graphics looked entirely ridiculous I just dont know who saw the stage version and thought it would translate well to film It doesnt Its also really boring and I tried to power through but left after about an hour The only positive was the music but I guess the film had nothing to do with that really James Corden is the worst,Negative
I still dont understand what Ive watched Never seen such a weird plotstructure if there even was one Did none of those Astars see that either The razzy goes to,Negative
Complete and total garbage There is absolutely nothing redeemable about this movie Andrew Lloyd Weber must have been out of his mind to sign off on this atrocity And thank you Jennifer Hudson for butchering and botching Memory I guess William Hung and Roseanne Barr couldnt clear their schedules so they hired Jennifer Hudson to ruin the only memorable part of this script Utter garbage,Negative
I watch bad movies as a hobby and this is among the worst movies Ive ever seen There is literally no story People were walking out Tom Hooper is the name Alan smithee uses when even hes embarrassed to put a name on his picture One of the worst movies of the decade  million dollars for that Imagine how many poor children you could feed,Negative
Honestly the worst thing I have ever seen  stars for the helpful nap I felt refreshed now Ive left Repetition repetition repititionof nothing This cat needed to see a vet and be put out of its misery Only plus point is that I didnt pay SHOCKING,Negative
This movie wasnt bad just had a lot of haters Give it a chance if I had to sit through Last Jedi  rise of sky walker you can get through this,Negative
Im giving it a  despite Jennifer Hudsons perfect performance I wish the whole movie was just her singing Memory,Negative
They should make another Disaster Artist movie out of this movie,Negative
The movie now somehow made me hate cats Bunch of Alisters in a really bad movie that will help you lose faith in humanity,Negative
"Drama adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webbers long running and very successful stage play Ive never seen the sage play so wasnt familiar with the plot and didnt know what to expectI liked most of the music dancing and the cinematography However my wife who is not a huge fan of musicals said she was quickly bored by the amount of consecutive musical scenesIf you like musicals youll like this
If you like dance youll like thisI dont understand how this is attracting so many poor reviews you might like given a chance but if you blindly follow the opinion of professional reviewers then probably best you miss this",Negative
Wow its probably one of the ugliest movies I ever seen You can tell the most of the actors tried their best but the whole movie just was so disgusting looking,Negative
Is there a plot I watched the entire movie and could not find one The movie is about as exciting as watching a dead cat sleep I have no idea how this movie got funded there is no humor plot or any entertainment value Please use the money youd potentially waste on this movie to a more deserving charity children in Africa deserve your money more than the excuse of producers who created this movie,Negative
"Everyone is crazy Go see this movie You wont be sorry This is a cinematic masterpiece It changed my life The CGI is spot on I totally believed that these were some sort of human cat hybrid Better movie than Joker The story was so deep I always thoughts were dogs until this movie opened my eyes Now every time I go home to my cat I bow down to it Cats are everything and this movie gave me a brand new perspective We can stop making movies now Nothing can top this That M was put to good use What a spiritual experience Love love love this beautiful movie Cant wait for the sequel
NOT",Negative
A feel its going to take a long time until a will recover from this abomination Might need some professional help to remove this from my memory,Negative
Oh God How Why I have so many questions All I want for Christmas is a decent movie,Negative
Its a musical yet half the cast cant sing Its like la la land again Camera work was rubbish the camera should stay still so can see the dance routines No wonder I actually fell asleep halfway through,Negative
When I saw this the CGI was not completed The cats looked like they were floating above the ground like on a cheap green screen there were cats that didnt have hair on them and there were major inconsistencies in the CGI they tried to create a plot because the broadway really doesnt have one just a bunch of cats introducing themselves for  hours but the plot was not very interesting the main antagonist fell completely flat the cats were incredibly creepy why did they have human faces and hands but they were the size of normal cats Everyone thinks this film is hilariously bad but honestly its not even funny bad it felt like torture watching this movie,Negative
The only reason to see this movie is to say you saw the worst movie of the decade that managed to come out only  days before that new decade,Negative
One of the absolute worst films ive ever seen to this day which is a shame with such a wide ranged and promising cast and crewI dont know what went wrong but there is no storyline to follow and what audience would enjoy this really does confuse medo not i repeat do not waste your time and money on this dumpster film,Negative
What could be more devastating than the destruction of several endangered species by feral catsCats the movie,Negative
After this movie I know longer see cats the same way,Negative
Never have I seen something as bad  Dont waste money or time,Negative
Please for your sanity and your bank balance avoidThis steaming pile of garbage was delivered at the th hour and it shows You will never be able to unsee this travesty The effect of pasting a persons face onto a CG fur body ranges from uncomfortable to ridiculous I dont blame the hardworking people at the effects house The director must be held accountableA boring musical theatre experience has been turned into a laughable movieRather have a cat scratch my balls than sit through this codswallop againIf only bleach could remove this monstrosity from my eyes and brainAVOID,Negative
Shame that the trailer looked great but nothing really happened,Negative
Awful experience complete none senseMy family will never forgive me for having them loose  hour  minutes,Negative
Not worth your time or money This was completely boring the entire time and is only interesting in its appalling imagery My friends and I saw it just to make fun of it and it wasnt even fun to do that Hopefully this movie is forgotten forever,Negative
I loved it Really loved I remember seeing the stage show as a child and it brought back all those memories Great music great visually I just loved it I cant imagine what anyone would expect from thisAnd the addition of the song Beautiful Ghosts was just the icing on the cake,Negative
"Having read all the negative reviews I knew I just had to watch it
Ive seen the show on stage many times over the years and found that this adaptation was true to the spirit
I forgot pretty much from the start the digital costumes as all the dance move feel pretty real because they were
Of course this will never be a movie for any kind of audience",Negative
Ok The CG is horendous and the story is literal trash I wouldnt want my kid to watch this movie,Negative
I dont know what i saw i swear i have not idea I rather watch Gigli and Catwoman Halle Berry version on a loop forever that watch this horror show again,Negative
After the opening scene I realised I made a terrible mistake watching the film  minutes into the film it was clear my cat Sir Catcelot had to find a new home,Negative
No Just no This is the worst movie of all time Its awful Dont watch it,Negative
This movie its beyond THAT BAD its what That bad would vomit onto a plate Seriously Just dont put yourself through it Any of it ever,Negative
Very bad acting not funny very boring and a disappointment A waste of an hour of my life haha,Negative
This film should not exist Its actually quite a talent that anyone could create something this badWouldve had more enjoyment from a rectal examDo not watch,Negative
Very strong computer work and d Nice attractive theme of  cats But it is very boring Too musical No catchy story No meaningful plot Waste of time and money I wish if the producers took a good advantage of the cat Theme with a comedy or inspirational movie,Negative
CATS was everything and anything I expected of this movie Loving the live musical I didnt expect this movie to NOT be weird and it  delivered on all of its weirdness The music is beautiful and haunting because ALW is the MAN when it comes to music If you go into this movie ready to inspect every detail and wondering Wait how did this happen or why did this happen then you are very much so missing the entire essence of this show This movie takes you into a different world and you dont leave it till the very last second Have fun enjoy the weird and let the memory LIVE AGAIN I for sure have tickets to see it again tomorrow ,Negative
Truly ambitious movie which has themes hope retribution and kindness themes surely needed in this climate we live in I tend to judge movies and fact most anyting from the view of perception and intention You see no one makes a movie assembles wonderful Talent spend unheardof amounts of money to intentionally have people dislike it now thats not to say I didnt fall asleep in certain sections of the picture and that doesnt mean that at times the direction is a bit leaden But for the most part I understood what the director was trying to accomplish and commend him for it and actually had a good time Judi Dench Taylor Swift Idris Elba Jennifer Hudson and Company perform and emote very very well the dance sequences very well done however this was a hard project to pull off from being on BroadwayGo see the film and open your heart and maybe then youll understand a very wellintentioned movie musical but simply not for everybody,Negative
I went into this movie with zero expectations and this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and Ive watched Gigli twice I am part of a podcast team that talks movies so we had to watch this movie as part of our show I cant tell you what happens in the last  of the movie because we walked out The CGI cats are awful looking and you cant help but shake your head at all of the big names in this  box of a movie I hope they got paid big bucks for this disaster Save your money and go listen to the soundtrack if you are into this kind of thing We ended up going to see the new Star Wars movie If I could have given it zero star I would,Negative
Our cats giggling tipped is offruff said ,Negative
Meaow meaow  NO I went mainly cos Taylor Swift was in it but it was a big mistake,Negative
Cats  makes Pet Semetary  look like a comedy What an absolute mess this movie was CGI at its worst,Negative
Worst movie ever even Micheal Bay movies are better,Negative
I cannot believe I spent actual money to see this film I will never look at a cat the same way again I cannot breathe I genuinely thought I was never going to escape the hell that is Cats,Negative
What did I even just seeThis is a hairball some lunatic at universal coughed up A horrible waste of money and time You will be utterly scarred for life after you see this movie Help me,Negative
I actually liked this movie It was almost exactly like the musical but with a few backstory things and more explanations I think the added stuff contributed well to it I really like the musical I know the cgi is strange in this but I didnt feel like it took away too much Overall a fun movie,Negative
Like Moulin Rouge the movie Cats is a weird sort of fantasy movie far far removed from reality Cats is definitely the lesser movie but still the concept is interesting the digital fur fascinating the singing can be terrific and the dance moves ballet hip hop Fosse and tap are great If dancing singing cats isnt your thing and if youre not a cat person best go see some other film This ones definitely for diehard fantasy fans Also if catlike people or peoplelike cats with digitally twitching tails and ears freak you out then stay away,Negative
I have submitted several reviews over the years but this is my first one starI have given Cats one star due to a scene that literally made me feel nauseous fat cat eating cockroachesPost WWII audiovisual torture techniques were developed They were designed to induce nausea I truly believe by pure chance Cats has happened upon some of these  It should genuinely be looked into In many of the Cats reviews people use phrases like fever dream  bad trip  I believe its no coincidence,Negative
"This Is Terrible AAH TerribleBad CGIsick etc
The Only GOOD are some songs wellUNIVERSAL WHAT ARE YOU DOING",Negative
The cgi was ok and even taylor swift and ian mckellan wasnt enough to safe this lack luster story about  cats that wanted to be reborn with one of their  lives but only one can be chosen I was unhappy the whole time in the movie except when it ended do not pay to see this,Negative
"This has so many great celebs in an awful film
The fact that the cats basically resemble humans makes the entire concept terrifying and just outright strange
This is a complete waste of money do not go and see this eyesore in the cinemas please",Negative
"What the hell did I just watch
I am obsessed with musicals Ive seen Broadway shows and movie musicals Some are bad but none are as bad as this movie
I cant even form a proper review The movie was awful The acting was subpar The theatre I watched it in had about forty people when the movie started By the time it was over there were maybe five of us left
Jennifer Hudsons rendition of Memory was the only thing I enjoyed but damn I would have rathered just download the song
The CGI was awful The costumes were so odd Some cats wore clothes the others didnt Every cat was morony it was awkward and uncomfortabe The humour was unfunny
Do not waste your money Its just so so so bad Its not even so bad its good It will not become a cult classic It is awful and always will be",Negative
I hope the adaptation would be quirky but fabulous and engaging I love musicals The cast was extremely promising The set was the best thing about itThis was nightmare inducing I have never sprinted from a theater before I got a refund Id expected to react to Jumanji The Next Level like this or even Black Christmas if anything Nope,Negative
Avoid this weird and awful mess This will give you nightmares days after you watch this,Negative
I have nothing to say about the plot because I slept through the movie That Rum Tum Tugger though it was just Jason Derulo in a cat costume so I found it funny Its a shame that they used Taylor Swift as a pure promotion tool She was there for like less than  mins for real My god I hate myself watching this on Christmas day,Negative
I blame this movie for causing I truly feel bad for those who paid to see this film Thats money that could have been used to start a dumpster fire Which you could then film release and get better reviews,Negative
I just watched Cats and after reading all these horrific views I dont get it It wasnt a great movie but it certainly doesnt warrant the level of vitriol that other reviewers have posted I saw the Broadway show many years ago and I dont see why the comparisons to it are so negative Also I find many of the negative reviews have a similar tone and verbiage as though they were written by a bunch of people sitting around brainstorming to see who could top each other with their insults of the movie I actually liked the sets and costumes I loved Dame Judy Dench as Deuteronomy and Sir Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat And Jennifer Hudson outdid herself once again I actually got chills when she sang the nd version of Memory,Negative
So bad Just so so very bad The person who said this is what everyone saw in Birdbox is spot on Avoid at all costs if you can,Negative
Much like Venom last year Cats is a worst movie of the year that isnt all that bad The movie has its fair share of flaws but the bright spots are very brightThe CGI isnt as eye bleed worthy as I thought it would be the comedy was missplaced in some parts but in others made me chuckle the singing was inconsistent however mostly good as was the acting and overall look of the film was decent By far my biggest complaint is the lack of a compiling naritive The film was unclear in what its plot was until fairly far in and even when it did lay out its master plan I felt it was far too simple for a movie as long and as costly as this one wasWhat saves the movie is beautiful singing from Jennifer Hudson among others and musical set pieces that are a joy to watch I dont think I will rewatch this anytime soon but I kinda glad I did at least once,Negative
Just why Its already bad enough but the icing on top of this horrific computergenerated cake is that these godforsaken abominations are called Jellicles   Dont see this movie I beg of you,Negative
Save your money or watch ipman  instead of this trash,Negative
I thought it was very good I had the luxury of never having the opportunity to see this in the theatre but growing up hearing the music I was very much looking forward to this Its not theatre and its not exactly a movie Its something different and if you watch it through that lens you may really enjoy it Those with really bad reviews I think they had the experience but missed the meaning,Negative
Ive seen the stage show twice in London got the DVD of the original cast doing it and have the songs in my music library If you like the original show this is not quite as good I think the attempts at adding humour and plot fall a bit flat and some of the effects detract from the performances rather than add to them But as a film adaptation of a musical its a lot better attempt than Les Miserables and if you take as a musical celebration of the original poems then its pretty good,Negative
The trailer looks promising but the actual movie is not very appealing Never seen the stage play yet and hoping could entice me to watch it in the near future but now after seeing it kinda doubtful of it Dont get me wrong the costume props were amazing but establishment of characters sound editing and mixes for me are out of tune and coincidentally Im tired before watching the movie and eventually fell asleep almost throughout a rare for me as a movie fan as a whole I saw some reviews like either you like it or hate it really only one song i really like is the song Memories thats about it,Negative
This movie is terrible its horrific its scary and disgusting and awful Do not see this movie I hope Hollywood learned its lesson,Negative
I dont even know I walked out and didnt even know what happened  mins in I knew it was gonna be a trip,Negative
The entire movie was like a weird furry fever dream Dont get me wrong the cast was wonderfully talented and their voices were beautiful However my brain just had no idea how to process the information given to it Humanoid cat people hybrids are never the move cinematically,Negative
Wtf is this Only watched the first  minutes Then I just gave up,Negative
The ONLY reason I rated this above a  was because of Jennifer Hudson She had one great scene The rest was like a really bad dream while on shrooms,Negative
But Why such bad reviews I expected to hate this but I found it entrancing and trippy I couldnt stop watching the ears and tails I fully understand why people might hate it but for me it was just plain weird strange and oddly enjoyable dont be put off and give it a go I guess its the marmite of films but I love marmite,Negative
"I dont see what the big deal was about this movie The plot was generally dumbpointlessbut so was the original plot of Cats I watched the  version at home the night after seeing this new version in the theaterand honestly they were like exactly the same Maybe I saw the rereleased version where they fixed the CGI issues but this movie just looked like any other movie
It was no where near as awful as the reviews would lead you to believe",Negative
I wish Id read these reviews before wasting my time and money getting tickets for this shambolic movie We made it to about  minutes in but had to leave then couldnt believe the cp that was showing on the screen Please dont bother to go to this movie spend time watchng your paint dry or your grass grow it will be much more interesting,Negative
"Cant believe this came from a director of Kings speech Looks like something Ed Wood would have made if he was alive and got a big budget for a movie
They could have atleast used computer animated house cats instead of those furry nightmares ",Negative
I swear to God Ill pistol whip the next person who says Jellicle Cats,Negative
Yes this is a goofy ridiculous movie but that was why the musical was so loved and it does not deserve the amount of butthurt the plebs and snobs are giving it Real criticism They cut a whole scene and some characters The new song beautiful ghosts seemed really shoved in Added scenes like on Growltigers boat were incredibly silly Theater people say the choreography was changed On the plus side I loved the colorful neon s London setting I loved the synthesizers in the score I loved the weird illogical moments they were surreal and mesmorized me Im more than happy to go see something weird while everyone else is pushing out formulaic safe stuff As for the look of the cats I had no problem with it and frankly was more than happy to see Idris Elbas dancing silhouette It was no more weird than the Cowardly lion in the Wizard of Oz Get off your high horse and go see this if you just want to have cheeky good fun,Negative
Ok Cats is not everyones favourite musical It never has been and never will be but all those people scoring it just a one Come on people give credit where it is due Jennifer Hudson can sing but maybe her rendition of Memory this time round was not the best Idris Elba was spot on as McAvity and Taylor Swift linked up nicely with him for their number But the showstopper was Skimbleshanks making it a tap dance worked so well and the whole dance crew joined in to make this a memorable routine And I quite liked James Cordens number visually it worked beautifullyOK the sets were not great but I have yet to see a production of Cats where it has been good Its just that type of show And Francesca Hayward was charming and beautiful to watch throughout Nobody seemed to notice these things Its still worth watching and with a cast like this yes definitely,Negative
I mean its not life altering In a good or a bad way I didnt hate it but then again The Wiz was my favorite movie as a child,Negative
"Eek it was ok
Is prob the best review i can say
Whats the point of taking a stage show and making a blockbuster movie that looks like a stage show Every scene looks like a cardboard or cgi backdrop So its hard to buyin to the feline world It all looks fake Its all so dull
And feels like a three hour movie rather than a two hour movie Nothing really happens laurie Davidson  Francesca Hayward shine out though despite all the high profile cast Francesca as a cat is strangely arousing
Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella has a house raising moment But Mckellan DenchDerulo Elba Winstone are all wasted here in unmemorable parts in a to be honest unmemorable movie To be frank It needed Sir Tim Rice as do all Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber productions ",Negative
"Ill give people its seriously strange and the effects between cat and human are super uncanny But its actually not as bad as everyone says on here
Tone down the expectations and just expect to be entertained",Negative
Apparently I watched something different than the other reviewers I love the stage musical This was a fun star filled cast adaptation of the theatre production Well done and creative with lots of cat antics and quirky touches to the different applicants,Negative
I am a musical theatre person and love musicals The sets and dancing and songssinging were beautiful I went to see this movie with my friend and we were nothing going into it expecting to laugh at how bad it was and we ended up actually enjoying it The thing I have to say that brought the score down was the fact that the faces are so weird and the cats have human hands and not actual hands and also the plot was really weird Other than that the movie was actually pretty good,Negative
It is not a masterpiece it doesnt make much sense and most scenes are just too ridiculous and convoluted to appeal a wide audience but come on people its a musical about cats having a party to decide who goes to the afterlife it sure is no Citizen Kane but in order to enjoy it you have to put your rational mind aside,Negative
I honestly dont get the hate I only knew some info about the stage play and this is exactly why I expected IDK if most people just didnt know what this was gonna be It isnt a great musical But there are definitely worse movies out there,Negative
Well it was painfully long for such a short movie The numbers were good Taylor Swift was great as was Rebel Wilson It just needed maybe some more excitement or substance or something It just didnt move quick enough for me to enjoy it I kept wondering when and wishing for it to be over The acting was great This was all down to the script and editing,Negative
"Movie Cats is a best musical movie I ever see Everything was just perfect and the weakest link for me was Judi Dench singing Yes I noticed that in some scene cats and the rest of the scenography is not in correct ratio but that is really all that was kind a bad Everyhing else was PERFECT
First of all ensemble The singing was FANTASTIC Dancing fantastic Every single role was ferfect Jennifer Hudson give new dimension singing Memory I am not fan of Taylor Swift but she was fantastic James Corden ah this role is made for him Rebel Wilson  fantastic
I really dont understand what made people write so many bad opinion You can like or dont like movie but to put it in  worst movies ever made I dont think so I really like to movie Thank you for making this movie",Negative
I am amazed that music talents like Taylor and Jennifer would sink this low in their carears as to join in with a complete tonedeaf cast of misc actors just to be in a musical on screenDoint the same roles at Broadway would have been much more logical and carear smart imhoBut if you like to watch a vulgar Rebel spread her legs wide and lick her tail you will get your fetishes all fullfilledIt is more painfull to watch the CGI effects in this movie than even rewatch old episodes of Star Trek from the s or sIt is a compliment to give this film a  star ranking but  is not possible to give,Negative
A nonsensical plot the worst CGI Ive seen in years and the worst scene the Rebel Wilson with cockroaches on a cake I can recall in a movie The film simply should have been thrown out at the drawing board stage It really does deserve every one star review its receiving The only positive was the performance of Francesca Hayward who was seriously let down by everything else from production direction CGI and other performances from the A list cast Haywood deserved more but its an absolute mess of a film,Negative
It seems theres an actual consensus for once on IMDB everyone hates this movie and rightfully so Its terrible and nobody wanted it much like the latest Star Wars Avoid this at all costs or at least try some hallucinogens but Im pretty sure youd have a bad trip,Negative
I almost feel like this movie is some cruel joke theres no need to even really review it this movie a waste of time money talent everything it will just depress you at how desperate hollywood is for a cash grab and how they think were all mindless consumersthis movie had one good thing it made me realize we should be demanding better movies its our money were spending and this is what they expect us to purchase,Negative
We liked it Maybe we are weird but we did like it It is a Musical not an action movie I have not seen the broadway show and always wanted to I am so glad they made this movie Just go a decide yourself ,Negative
If you own a cat live near a cat or ever again intend on being in close proximity of a cat do not watch this move The irresistible urge to kick every cat you see is a real side effect of being exposed to this rubbishPlease desex your cats your fat English talk show hosts and your self important pop stars,Negative
Absolutely devastated to write a bad review but it was shocking so much so I walked out less than half way through the film,Negative
The cats still look like humans and that scares me cause that is what Dr Munreau does,Negative
Terrible wish I could rate it zero stars They changed what the musical was originally about,Negative
 hour and minutes of my life I will now be getting back Even my children were disappointed For the cast of big names I was expecting something spectacular but instead it was one of the worse films I have ever seen,Negative
Superb production values great performances and mesmerizing dance routines but the lack of story and weak editing spoil it Theres a great variety of songs and types of music but the way they join together results in a jumbled mishmash of genres and styles which is further exacerbated by the nonsensical lyrics The acting and celebrity performances are good but they are a bit jarring at times and although its a very magical and impressive production I was a bit bored by the end,Negative
Im more entertained by reading this reviews im watching this movie while i write this ive always hated cats and nothing has changed if anything i hate them more,Negative
Yes its weird I completely agree Although everything different is not necessarily bad The CGI makes the actors look alien but kept their familiar faces I must admit am I the only one that it created a fascinating somewhat creepy attractiveness The choreography is different from what you have seen before but it fits the cat theme perfectly If all the critics would answer truthfully they simply cannot say anything negative about the quality of the dancers If you have seen the earlier musical version of Cats you can see the nice parallels they draw I would give it a  if it werent for the very thin story line and the mediocre singing which almost made me leave after the first  minutes of the movie So I will eventually rate the movie with a  It was entertaining to see something familiar repacked in a weird setting that would fit well in an incoherent dream that I can only describe in this probably incoherent review,Negative
In the ongoing war against human intelligence this film qualifies as a war crime The filmmakers and actors are war criminals They go on trial at the Hague And then grow old in a Jellical prison Thankfully they only have ONE life,Negative
Cant think of any positives A blemish on the actors CV Laughable CGI and effects,Negative
I blame myself I dont know what I was expecting this movie is just wrong and weird and I couldnt really see the point of bringing all these Alists together for this disaster,Negative
"Absolutely not worth spending money and time to watch
Effects are looking cheap and horrible
Film itself is simply boring Not entertaining at all",Negative
So catslets talk about this thing and waste even more of my time with writing this and yours by riding itbut since i wasted part of my life by watching it lets gocats is one of biggest failures of entire year and that means in every single way possiblelets admit it what can we espect from a film that doesnt have plotand entire cgi and visual effects are really hard and disturbing to look athell i felt sorry for actors like dench and mckellen to be in this but it was their decision they choose for whatever reason probably moneycats is proof that stage musicals dont work in films and it is wasting everyone time and patience with its existance,Negative
The worst dumpster fire of a movie Ive ever seen in theaters Not even National Treasure Dame Judi Dench could save this film from the stain it has put upon the world My friend and I went knowing it would be bad so we had a few drinks before Not even my  glasses of wine could delude me into thinking its a good film The CGI was a joke the special effects laughable the acting was terrible and over the top I expect this was the doing of Tom Hooper and to top it all off every chorus had stray notes and no cohesive harmony Nothing about this film was salvageable a total wreck EVERY MOMENT WAS CRINGEWORTHY I literally cringed ON my cringes What baffles me is that there were about  other viewers in the audience and no one walked out no one shouted at the screen about how bad it was no one besides us even cackled at the absurdity of the whole stanky mess,Negative
So disappointed and No sense of humour compared to the live musical Slow songs went on for far too long or so it felt and I honestly struggled to stay awake Storyline was slow and Im still confused what exactly the story is,Negative
I love this movie The songs the dancing the creativity It brings the theatre to my living roomIt is disappointing to see the bad reviews and some of the actors bad mouthing the movie because of its reviews The reviews about the CGI and the fact they have normal hands make no senseIm not sure what they expectedpaws Which were not in the theatre productionIts a great portrayal of the theatrical show Watch with the mindset of going to the theatre rather than watching a film,Negative
"I am not a steady user reviewer in IMDB But felt the need to review this one
As most of us before going to watch it I checked the rating and reviews in IMDB
Wow how many horrible reviews it has received
So I went there prepared to watch one of the worst films I have ever triedThis was not the case though The film is not the average Hollywood musical with a blend of dialogues and songs It is almost just songs Be prepared for that
I have not seen the theatre play so I cannot compare But found this film quite good It is not a fast paced movie It is not intended to
After the half  it becomes more emotional and captivating
I think the movie delivers what it is intended to a theatrical experience of a musical Relying more on the music and lyrics than complex dialogues to transfer the ideas and emotions to the viewer
Succeeded with me",Negative
This will change your whole perspective of view when you look at at your own cats I tried so hardly to enjoy this movie with my Friskies Special Edition Popcorn and my Fancy Feast Soda but my brain just turned into a giant hairball CGI HumanCats should be censored,Negative
Smoke a little weed put the mind in neutral and forget that the collars around the kitties necks have a tendency to move just slightly slower than the necks themselves Dont ask why one cat is stripping off her skin to show more fur underneath  and certainly dont ask what her outer garment would be made of Really just dont do itIt never ceases to amaze me when a director takes essentially bulletproof material like this and says Hey lets see what I can do to really screw it up Still it had some nice moments that lasted maybe a few seconds apiece and some intriguing ideas that lasted even shorter time The background were in the main charming but clearly meant for another movie altogether Maybe a French musical with Gene Kelly But not this one,Negative
Shocking effects pathetic editing weird casting and just feels and looks like it was made by amateurs or for a bet Really bad Avoid at all costs,Negative
This was just Holy crap where to start This film was so bad I think a visit to the dignitas clinic would be much more fun then this abomination,Negative
Watching this film caused my airway to constrict and my skin to break out in hives Had to walk out and sneak into the theater showing jumanji instead  better spent on paying someone to punch you in the jaw,Negative
Im not sure I can be as creative with my review as others I would just say DONT DO IT Releasing a version with improved CGI will NOT make this less of a flop Its tried to be arty but is just terribly freaky Crying shame We left  mins in as did  others Wish Id gone to see Star Wars with the hubby instead,Negative
"Basically dont bother it only got a  rating because I couldnt pick a 
There is no plot to be seen and I cant believe the cast list signed up to this film because they didnt make it anymore watchable
If you have cat or can borrow one watch that for  hours instead of this film because it will be far more enjoyable
WARNING remember you cannot unsee this film once youve watched it",Negative
I dont know why this movie has such a poor rating perhaps its because the people that watched it werent big musical fans or had never seen the original cats But I personally think that this movie was done way better than the original stage production The CGI is beautiful The music is so much more catcher than the original production the scenes are beautiful and it has an amazing cast Biggest thing of all this is SO much easier to understand Bravo,Negative
I have to admit I do not understand how everyone hates this movie Im not quite saying that this is a gem but despite some issues its actually quite an alright movieFirst theres a point some kind of message simplistic as it might be which is more than I can say for most movies of the current decade Second the cast can actually sing and dance Which has most certainly not been the case with some of the most popular musicals of the recent era La La Land comes to mindAnd while Im sure the cat costumes were not for everyone I dont believe the ratings here in any way reflect the quality of the movie,Negative
Taking theatre productions and turning them into movies with few exceptions has always been a disaster This is no different,Negative
I know I never got to see the musical but I did listen to the original songs And I absolutely hate the new music,Negative
To ruin such a famous play is damm right shameful and a tragedy of cinema,Negative
I was so let down by movie presentation of cats The costumes were amazing There was a star studded cast with some unfamiliars Some of the songs were slightly different than I remembered them All in all the movie was just ok I was disappointed Could have just made it a Netflix movie,Negative
Absolutely terrible My wife and I decided we would ignore the bad reviews and see it and form our own opinion What a mistake Whoever casted this movie should be confined to a  room with  cats and a huge basket of catnip,Negative
Its a musical so it has dancing and singing but thats the only thing it has Its just a waste of time No humor no action no excitement Its a long introduction of characters that disappear  minutes after they are introduced It could have been so much more but they chose to make it boring as hell,Negative
I have always loved Andrew Lloyd Webbers musical Cats and loved seeing it come to life on the big screen The movie follows the musical and has one new song that is a wonderful addition The dancing in this movie is AMAZING Judy Dench is fabulous as a cat and Jennifer Hudson steals the show with her rendition of Memory,Negative
Do not watch this film even as a joke the worst film of the decade by far,Negative
I was excited to see this for the music dance and favorite actors What a let down this was Im shocked that the producers thought this was good From this time forward Ill wait a month irv before paying good  to be a movie,Negative
Best movie ever along the lines of Baby Geniuses The Garbage Pail Kids and Deathbed The bed that eats people,Negative
You know who decided to make this movie I dunno people who wanted to depopulate mankind I wonder how many here wanted to take it out on street cats for this movie,Negative
This is the worst movie ive ever seen couldve guessed by looking at the pictures and commercials for this movie as it looks HORRIFYING which it is i really want to know who thought this would be a good idea they should be jailed also how is this movie nominated for a golden globe ive seen maybe  good reviews about it and they didnt make NEARLY as much as they spent to make this movie this whole thing is a mess that needs to go away,Negative
I enjoyed watching the ice cubes melt in my drink more that watching the film,Negative
I loved it They didnt STRAY much at all from the original Its just cats dancing song after song Of course there is really no plot there never was I found the imagery to be neat and odd I honestly think they took a big risk releasing something like this to the general audience They could have changed it to make it appeal to the masses which would have yielded a better profit and review But Im personally glad they stayed true to what it is,Negative
Its strange how critics attacked this movie No wonder but its far from as horrible as they claimCertain musical numbers extrapolate the effects are silly choreographies mainly of the main actress forcing ballet steps which go against the idea of the filmHowever overall I thought it was an average movie Good funDont believe in such low grades I have certainly seen much worse things that have had more benevolence from critics,Negative
Worst movie Ive seen in  so far and I watched Good Boys Horrible casting Horrible choreography Horrible cinematography and HORRENDOUS CGI Whatever musical this was based on was a horrible second Jason Derulo and Rebel Wilson somehow managed to make this gruesome movie even worse than what it already was If its not a Disney musical dont make it Aladdin was bad enough Thank you for your time,Negative
Proof that Cats do have nine lives Jelical cats who have three names makes no sense for us lay cat people Rebels furry crotch shots made us laugh Film should have had subtitles so lay cat people could understand what was happening,Negative
"Please dont hate cats because of this movie Please dont hate cats because of this movie Please dont hate cats because of this movie Please dont hate cats because of this movie
Thanks",Negative
I have been a stage performer for over  years and I have NEVER seen such a load of rubbishDuring the Jellical opening number they looked like monkeys dancingthose stupid long tails flopping aroundFor me the star was Francesca Haywardher dancing was ELEGANT BUT to see cats dancing ballet looked SOOOO out of placeJames Cordens makeup was a jokeI felt sorry for Dame Judishe was out of placeAs an actor I am a big fan BUTI could keep going but I have to stop because I could start getting so very negative,Negative
The cats movie is just mindless cringe worthy has no meaning and they rereleased it to make it seem better but it didnt help it made it worse Never come out with another movie like this again,Negative
I had no idea what was going on the whole time The story line made no sense and it was honestly difficult to watch The film was way too long even for a good film so the fact it was absolutely awful made it unbearable This film had so much potential to be good especially due to the famous cast but it ended it up being so bad I do not recommend this film at all,Negative
The most stupid movie plot and an even worse CGI technology makes the cats head look like severed from their shoulder The heads doesnt look to belong to the cat,Negative
This film deserves the same treatment t as the Star Wars Holiday Special The trailer for this film couldnt prepare for what a cluster fire truck was going to see Who do I see from the studio about getting my money and soul back,Negative
"Worst Movie i have ever watched
I want a refund after watching it I dont know what those cats for why are they singing that song what is the storyline and ended",Negative
Yes I saw those kinda creepy trailers no I was never a fan of the Broadway musical yes I was prepared to watch the movie with my family and have a good laugh at itI did not expect to love the movieIt wasnt just me either I watched it with my children on Thanksgiving Day   and  and they agreed I wasnt just suffering some sort of delusionYes the CGI on the cat people could be disturbing at times but once you got used to the whole idea of human faces with cat ears most of the actors looked quite goodThe songs are mostly great the performers voices are fantastic the set pieces are imaginative though the dancing cockroaches may have been a little too much the attention to detail is really quite impressiveHow on earth did this movie become so hatedTaylor Swifts song is one of the best movie sequences of all time and the Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer sequence isnt far offand where else are you going to see a tap dancing cat,Negative
Its okay people its not like we needed eyesight to see this catastrophe unfold anyway,Negative
I get that the CGI was scary and weird And I really dont like that the movie tried to give it a big antagonistic plot And comic relief The musical is supposed to have nonsensical lyrics with outstanding dancing and a minimal plot It is not a joke This movie made it a joke Please dont let this ruin musicals for you,Negative
"The absurdedness of it almost was worth the price of admission My review
Frenetic foolishness
followed by too many flicking tails
followed by M E M O R I E S with a snotty nose
followed by more frenetic foolishness
and a cringing Judi Dench
followed by Taylor swift being Taylor swift
Followed by more frenetic foolishness
with a redux of M E M O R
Follow by a very good Ian McKellen
Followed by utter chaos
One second of a beautiful Idris Elba without his coat
Followed by a much anticipated end",Negative
The whole movie would be  times better if its pure comedy and rated r like Deadpool too,Negative
Mom they posted cringe well cringe are ironically funny but Its disturbing  My EYES agghh,Negative
Just dont literally the worst thing I have to experienced,Negative
Excellent movie beautiful gorgeous filled with fantasy and emotion it does exactly what a movie should do entertain the audience I loved it Ive seen it three times and I liked it every time Special effects are perfect the singing and dancing the same Dont listen to the bullies who trash this movie give it a shot and I promise youll love it,Negative
Dont understand the super bad reviews and hate for this movie I have never watched the musical so had zero expectations I thought the movie was quite entertaining and a fun watch for the whole family My  year old nephew suddenly got out of his seat and started dancing when Rum Tum Tugger was doing his thing The kids got a good laugh out of the silly antics of Jennyanydots played by Rebel Wilson who was essentially playing herself in all her other movies Dont get me wrong I LOVE Rebel Wilson Inthink shes hilarious Absolutely loved Ian McKellans performance as Gus and his presentation piece to contend for the Jellicle Choice CG was able to gift this movie with realistic feline twitches and movements for the actorsIve seen some reviews claiming there is no plot Its quite simple you got a bunch of cats who are contending to be selected as the chosen Jellicle to be whisked away to a new life in Heaviside Layer Wheres Heaviside Layer Who knows Its just some place a bunch of cats made up Ultimately this is a movie about  well Cats And the mystical  magical lives they lead,Negative
Never saw the play but just saw the movie I was in shock Kept waiting to find out what the roar or meow was all about The tunes werenr catchy The lyrics werent clever and although Jennifer Hudson was good i thought Betty Buckley sang Memories like no one else It was like the Emperors new clothes No one wants to admit hes naked No on wants to admit that Cats sucks,Negative
Dont waste your time and money I was like yeah i give it a chance and fell asleep Its really boring,Negative
I just dragged my husband to try and see for myself how it could be so bad with that cast but seriously cringeworthy and cant understand how any director or producer could sit watching this back still allowed it to be released ,Negative
Lmao I am not even going to talk about it This movie was so horrible that its giving me nightmares,Negative
A terrible movie Everything is so wrong with the film It is really bad It feels so off and poorly made,Negative
I saw Cats on stage over  years ago and enjoyed the music but thought it was a weird story My expectations were low going into the theater this morning and when it was over my friend and I just laughed at how truly horrid it was The CGI is beyond bad and Taylor Swift needs to NEVER act again Seriously she was the worst her accent was painful to listen to The only redeeming part of the movie was Jennifer Hudson and her big number The ending was laughable to say the least The sad thing is there was so much talent in this movie and it was just wasted on cheesy CGI and painful to watch cat moves Tom Hooper you should ashamed of yourself,Negative
Ok loads of people hate this but there is no CONFLICT,Negative
Fans of the Broadway musical will enjoy the film adaptation of Cats The film is beautifully choreographed well cast and gorgeously set The writers did a better job of explaining the storyline than the stage production If you hate musicals or are just watching Cats to hate on it maybe find something better to do with your time,Negative
