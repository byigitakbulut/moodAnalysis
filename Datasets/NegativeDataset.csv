0,"Saw 'The Emoji Movie' as a big fan of animation, to see whether the concept (which was one that was hard to decide whether it was intriguing or baffling) would work, as someone who has liked the previous work of a lot of the voice actors (i.e. Patrick Stewart) and whether it was as bad as the tsunami of negative publicity before release and when it came out made it out to be.After seeing it, there are worse films out there (animated and otherwise) but 'The Emoji Movie' is a mess, if not quite the recipe/incarnate for cancer that has been described. Regarding the target audience from personal experience (this doesn't mean that it will apply to all audiences or everybody's experiences), 'The Emoji Movie' didn't appeal to either children or adults in my cinema screening. Adults were squirming their way throughout the film and while recognising the things that are referenced were groaning and rolling their eyes at how everything was executed. Children looked like a lot of the ideas were going over their heads and seemed more interested in their bags of sweets and popcorn than what was going on on screen. It was a mix of both with me.The best, or shall we say the least bad, thing about 'The Emoji Movie' is the voice cast. Most of the voice actors gave decent performances (James Corden and Patrick Stewart are the liveliest of the bunch), though a few didn't fit their characters (Maya Rudolph has shown that she can voice act with a lot of bubbly personality but she was just wrong here). They did deserve much better however, and should have known much better, didn't think that Stewart could lose more dignity but he managed it in a embarrassingly misconceived character that he gave much more to than deserved.Everything else comes off badly or worse. There are worse-looking animated films, but the animation never rises above routine, often looking flat and stiff and there is a complete lack of imagination, the colours never popping out at you as they ought like they do from personal experience with ""emojis"". The soundtrack is all noise and no subtlety, and tends to be inappropriate.When it comes to the writing and the story, 'The Emoji Movie' fails. And not just by a little. We are talking hardcore. All the jokes fall flat because of how randomly they tend to be executed and the jokes in quality are juvenile at best and infantile at worst. The script is peppered with dialogue that is overripe and will embarrass even the youngest of cinema goers, when it's not going over their heads. The story, proof that the concept was more of a questionable one than a good one, is not much of one and feels like it was made up as it went along, with the insertion of the likes of Candy Crush, Spotify, Youtube and Facebook being little more than blatant product plugs explored in a mostly throwaway fashion. There are a lot of random and unnecessary scenes and even more so facepalm-worthy moments.Imagination is zero here, with a mishmash of ideas reminiscent of 'Inside Out', 'Wreck It Ralph' and 'The Lego Movie', all three actually being good films (masterpieces in the case of the first two), but without the fun, creativity or emotional investment which are as non-existent as the imagination. The basic theme is a relatable one when done right, but dealt with indifferently. The characters are both bland and annoying, character development is minimal and what there is is rushed.Overall, a mess. While it is a little better than made out, there is the agreement that the film is a disaster that is more poop than it is meh, despite being the general consensus it seems that this review is not going to be popular when it comes to useful votes. Despite being a subjective person, the excessive non-useful votes for the negative reviews and the up-voting of the positive ones are a little suspicious to me. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Negative
1,"'The Emoji Movie"" is a new children's film. One of the posters for it has a picture of whipped poop on the front of it. Was there a focus group done that says kids really want this? This masterpiece takes place inside of some kid's i-phone in a place called Textopolis. Gene is a Meh emoji who just wants to cut loose and show a whole range of emotions, which apparently counts as a malfunction and gets him scheduled for deletion. Now before you think i'm just going to crap on this movie, know that it is kind of fun for a certain age. These killer robots chase Gene and two of his buddies around which always keeps things fast-paced, there's all sorts of promotional tie-ins with Candy Crush, Instagram, and Spotify that while cheap product placement, also are kinda funny and exciting.Like all kids movies nowadays with fairly weak scripts, there's also a soundtrack filled with dance songs that should have kids dancing in the aisles, and guess what, it's not just stuff from your kids generation but some from yours too. Take the stuff that's for you where you can cause a lot of the jokes are either literal bores (Internet trolls are trolls, etc.) or center a lot on cartoons having overly cartoony personalities. There's an overly smiley emoji who borders on the psychotic, joyless Meh emojis. This stuff is kinda funny, but the joke is thin. Then there's the stuff you should expect already going in. Like the jokes centered on the poop emoji, or the Hi-Five emoji saying ""talk to the hand."" Does anyone say this anymore? It's amazing this movie was co-written by Mike White, writer of ""School of Rock"" and Jennifer Aniston's ""The Good Girl"". It's sporadically funny and you can tell it's trying be a kind of ""Wreck It-Ralph"" meets ""Inside Out"" but it's not really inventive enough to be either. The kid whose phone this is never really becomes much of a character and probably the funniest part of this movie is that among a plethora of other scattered and unsubtle messages about including everyone and real friends are better than online ones, this also comes with a message of ""be yourself"" told primarily through emojis who want to be more than themselves. Lastly, and for the love of God I hope this was meant as a joke, there are scenes where the emoji is given way too much credit in the scope of love and life in this film. If this is true then it really does go all the way down from here folks. But that's ""The Emoji Movie"" in a nutshell. You'll laugh in parts, wanna reach over and tell your kids movies used to be so much better than this in others, and finally, just want to weep for the future.If you liked this, please check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.",Negative
2,"The movie is not that bad I don't understand all that hate, I remember watching it in the theaters few years ago and I loved it.The movie is not that bad go and watch if you want to download the found reviews talk to you.",Negative
3,"I hate this movie so much! It wasted such perfectly good voice actors, and it was a waste of product placement! Man, it ripped off Wreck-it Ralph, The Lego Movie, and Inside Out! The jokes are just stupid! Sure, the animation was fine and all, but still!",Negative
4,"The plot is not exactly stellar, however the performances are good and the jokes are funny and smart.
It is relevant to the present, even though not exaclty easy to relate to the characters.
The message of the movie is also a nice one, inspirational and motivational.
In any case the movie does not have any serious flaws rhat would make it a 3.3 stars movie, it hds the storyline together and coherent, as said it is smart and funny.
If you came across on this movie on TV do not chnage the chanel, it is worth the watch.",Negative
5,"Don't watch it, you'll waste your life!!! Watch Spider-verse instead!!!",Negative
6,Is the Emoji Movie the best movie ever made? Yes.I saw this movie in Japanese captions.,Negative
7,"I know it's really fun to bash this movie, but speaking honestly, I have to say this movie was okay. The story is predictable, the twist was not surprising, the romance between Gene and Jailbreak felt forced, and I didn't care for the humans, but the story at least had structure and competency, and was consistent. The majority of the humor is weak and immature, especially with the Poop Emoji. Some of the gags managed to make me chuckle, not laugh but I did find enjoyment. The animation is good, it's colorful and energetic, and there are some creative scenes, even with the product placement scenes. However the designs of the Emojis are really, really simplistic and some are even creepy. The characters are not interesting. Gene is the same old ""I wan't to fit in"" character, and the other characters are also the same old tropes as well. The characters also have their developments presented in the most generic way possible. The characters that stand out for me is the villain and Gene's parents. Mostly because they supply the best comedy and the villain has an this crazy personality that kept me active. The Emoji Movie is a meh film that's suited to entertain kids.",Negative
8,"This film rips off Wreck It Ralph, Inside Out, and The Lego Movie. The story was boring, the jokes were unfunny, HI-5 was more annoying and obnoxious than funny, and it portrays teens as phone addicts who can't go 5 seconds without their phones, even in class. While I may also be a teen who spends a lot of her time online, I get off when I need to. The animation is good, but good animation cannot save a bad film from being bad. ""Oh, but Galán, you're just not part of the film's target audience!"" I know that, but I'm also not part of the target audience for the films it rips off (Well I was when they came out) and I still enjoy them. Sony cancelled the Popeye movie for this, and the Popeye movie looked like it had more effort put into it, it looked more promising. I luckily didn't have to pay to see it, but to the fellows who rated 1 star and had to pay, I'm sorry.So the only things I liked were the animation, and that the teens looked like actual teens rather than twenty-something year olds (while they cast adults to play teens in live-action teen movies, I've seen some animation where the teens still look like adults).",Negative
9,"I doubt anyone expected this movie to be Citizen Kane but I have to say it at least didn't put me to sleep. Unlike Citizen Kane.The premise of creating a film around emojis is extremely thin, however the result is suprisingly fun with some very good casting choices, such as Tim Miller. The moral of the story is a bit of a miss but I doubt this was the reason most people saw this.It also goes to show that Patrick Stewart is up for a laugh by allowing himself to be cast as the poop emoji, by far the most unique role he's ever taken on.Overall it's great mindless fun for people of all ages and well worth at least one viewing.",Negative
10,"This is pure art. I don't need words for context. You can just tell by the beautiful and meaningful title, depicting the innocent and dream-like lives of the Emojis! 10/10",Negative
11,"I am not paid by sony or the producers so this is a real review:
the movie had a good story (like every other movie) the animation was pretty good and the jokes were pretty funny 10/10",Negative
12,"So bad, I can't even find words to describe it... Why????? Funny? Nope. Exciting? Nope? Did we learn something? Yeah, never ever watch The Emoji Movie again! And Hollywood has too much money... And NEVER EVER watch this crap again!",Negative
13,It's hard to overstate how bad this is. A stellar comedic cast and any one of them could have created a better movie if it was just 90 minutes of them reading the phone book.Do not ever watch this!,Negative
14,"Just awful. The jokes didn't land, the animation was dull and uninspired, the characters, when they weren't being incredibly annoying, were one note and clichè. Really, who on earth had the idea to make a movie about emoji? Not only all this, but the film is so much a copy of other kid's films it's not even funny. Half the time I wasn't sure if I wasn't the Emoji Movie, or Wreck-it-Ralph (A far superior film) Don't waste your time on this. The fact that a Popeye movie was canceled for this after the incredible footage released is criminal.",Negative
15,"I feel like this movie had a good message for kids and well, everyone. I don't understand why it was so hated. My family and I were really hoping for a sequel. I think people need to give this another chance.",Negative
16,"I just want to start this by saying I went into this with zero expectations because of all the reviews. I was amazed when I watched it I found myself genuinely loving it. I thought it was a very fun kids movie. I think people sometimes dislike things because they think it is ""cool"" but one thing I was taught from a very young age was to not be too cool to enjoy things. I know it sounds cheesy but I swear some people just dislike because ""everyone"" else dislikes it too. I am not saying that you have to like or that's the reason why everyone say they dislike I'm just saying try not to be negative. It's a great movie that is nothing more than it needs to be. It does have some bad parts like a bit too much consumerism but it is so feel good. This is just my personal opinion but think twice before you decide the movie is going to bad.",Negative
17,"I'm shocked this is rated so poorly. The movie was enjoyable and fun, and great for kids. Was this a dramatic masterpiece sure to win awards? No. Of course not. it was not intended to be that sort of movie. It is the story of a broken emoji's quest to become un-broken. He must journey through different apps on the phone in order to reach the cloud. On this journey we get to see an imaginative view of what different apps could look like if the were ""real"". It is pretty clever, really. The Emoji Movie is full of humor (the joke about the elderly is HILARIOUS) and it has Steven Wright voicing the main character's father. I think this movie is definitely worth watching if you have kids... They'll love it and I would think the parents would enjoy it too.",Negative
18,"Here we go.... The Emoji Movie: basically smash The Lego Movie and Wreck-It Ralph together and get a sentient aubergine to write it and you get the Emoji Movie- which is about Gene (T. J. Miller) a 'Meh' emoji, but Gene has other emotions beyond just meh and is labelled a malfunction so he sets of on a journey through the phone to find himself, while also going through Candy Crush, Just Dance, YouTube, Spotify, Dropbox, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter... USE OUR PRODUCTS. This is a bad movie straight up, but I kinda of wish it was worse. Then it could have turned into 'so bad it's good' kinda film, but sadly this is just a dull, zestless, pointless and oddly confusing movie which is only 1 hour and 31 minutes long but feels like 3 hours staring at a flickering light bulb with this stupid gormless smile. Patrick Stewart voices a poo emoji- do you want a more telling metaphor than that?The thing is for a movie about our emoji culture, it seems to hate its very subject matter, it makes fun of all its app related features but never goes full out on them so it's not even a satire of this culture. And of course the product placement is just the worse. There's literally a 10 minute sequence in the Candy Crush world where they play an actual game of Candy Crush. That said the beat moment in this ""movie"" was the Instagram part: the characters could walk into the photo itself and everything is frozen in place which is kinda nice but I've seen that done better in other movies- Looney Tunes: Back in Action did that with actual works of art, with the style of animation mirroring the style of art which is way more creative. Unsurprisingly this is a bad movie but no where near enough that it's worth any great deal of attention. If you want to see an alright animated movie anytime soon go see Cars 3 it's another Cars movie but that's more entertaining than this 'meh' movie. I give The Emoji Movie a D-.... But this was also my worst cinema going experience to date- never has the audience reflected the movie so well (they also were just the worst) and for that The Emoji Movie gets demoted to an F",Negative
19,"Gene couldn't be meh, but this ""movie"" made me meh. Turned it off after 15 or 20 minutes and I was watching it for free. One of the worst things recorded to film I've ever had the displeasure of letting come into contact with my cornea.",Negative
20,"This is this kind of movie that you think you would love it but when you watch it you realize that its total disaster. This movie doesn't have any story. I expected that this movie will show that having friends and connecting with people in the real world it is more important than texting emojis on your telephone.
In my opinion, this is the worst movie I ever saw.",Negative
21,"You look at this title page and think, Oh, what a cute movie about emojis! You watch the film and think, I want my life back! This movie contains a ridiculous plot that sounds like the creators are just trying to sell about 100000000 emoji pillows. The plot isn't even that clear, and it's hard to understand why anyone's doing anything in the first place. The interactions between characters are weird and unnatural.But let's start from the obvious. This film contained two game tutorials and three demonstrations. You can practically see a little four year old thinking about how great Dropbox is as they watch this excuse for a motion picture.You would assume a movie to be enjoyable, artistic, original, and funny. The Emoji Movie is none of these things. Absolutely unoriginal - a typical story about someone who doesn't fit in. None of the jokes in this entire movie even made me smile. It is an insult to the arts. When you put all that I have said together, you can assume that it was not enjoyable either.I beg you not to pay to have one hour and thirty-one minutes of your life wasted.",Negative
22,"The movie is not terrible at all. The concept is interesting enough and there is a lot to look at which keeps you interested. The story itself was even a good idea and enjoyable. It was pretty cool how they integrated the phone, even if it left some things to be desired. That's about where it stops for the positives though.The execution was poor. Nothing completely makes sense. There are a lot of things that aren't explained. As you watch, you don't really care about any of the characters.Also, it really just felt like a much worse version of inside out. The phone world felt like Riley's brain and the characters like the emotions. But that works in Inside Out and it just does not here. I cared about Riley and the emotions in that movie but I don't care about Alex or these emojis. I think the biggest difference and the biggest problem with this movie is that it lacked build up into the plot that a movie like Inside Out had.Like I said, it is not terrible. I love animated movies and would call this one a movie you show a child. They're all made for children, but only some are so good that even adults will fall in love.",Negative
23,"We live in a society 💔😭
Also the main character, Gene, is hot.",Negative
24,"We have to scoop back to neutrality here. The more reactive takes seem to have kind of missed the plot. You read the title before watching it yes or no ?....In what world was a satirical animation movie based of modern day's overused trash hieroglyphics going to make the top shelves or be a 7 or 8. It was never to be and that's not why anyone would have been inclined towards it in the first place.They pulled it off in my own vested opinion. It was funny - I laughed, satirical, and not too rough on the edges. It was never going to logically make sense in a million years, but that wasn't the point and that's not what got anyone in the studio.Instead the real criticism perhaps can be it's similarity to other animation pieces, however it's best to note where conceptually the assimilations could be placed before saying it's a cop-out. With the ratings alone I never thought I was going to watch it, but it's definitely not a 3/10, it's about a 5/10 and one extra for even pulling it off at all so a 6.If there was ever going to be world where this is a 7 or 8, the age rating would likely have to have been upscaled, and also the originality of this movie undoubted.",Negative
25,"Ever sincethat fateful day on July 28th my life has changed eternally .70% of my time awake is devoted to watching this as everything else I do is immensely boring and sad compared to the genius that is ,Emoji.",Negative
26,Not much else to say. Nothing is good about this movie. I guess the animation was good kinda sad the animators tried.,Negative
27,"The Emoji Movie...okay, I just made a bit of pause because I don't even know how to start this. Let me just start how I usually start. The premise. So in this boy's phone, there's a city called Textopolis where all emojis live (?) and wait to be picked by that boy. And we follow the emoji that has multiple emotions and he's supposed to be ""meh"". So he wants to kinda cure himself on this journey through all kinds of product placements possible.At the same time that boy Alex who owns the phone tries to make her like him with an emoji because I guess emojis and technology are the only way to express your feelings this days, and there's even a quote in this movie about how emojis is the most important form of human communication. I'm not lying, I'm not exaggerating, they said that. It's freaking line from this movie. If you still don't believe me, I don't blame you, just don't try to make sure while seeing it for yourself. You DO NOT need that in your life. You have better things to do with your time. Just imagine something like The Lego Movie, Tron and Inside Out if all of them were one giant cash-grab of a ""movie"". Halfway through, I couldn't even tell if I was watching a movie or a feature-length commercial. With every cliché an animated kids movie could possibly fall into. Lead isn't who everyone wants him to be? Check. ""Funny"" sidekick on a journey? Check. Group arguing before the third act starts? Check. A character supposedly dies? Check. A dance sequence to a pop song (possibly by Pitbull)? Check. Only this one isn't even relevant anymore. Wanna know what it is? Well, even if you don't, I just can't resist. It's FEEL THIS MOMENT? GET IT?! BECAUSE THEY ARE EMOJIS AND THEY FEEL THINGS?! Ha, ain't that clever?!Okay, I don't think I have anything else to say and even if I do, it's probably nothing good. Avoid this and maybe you'll save the movie industry at least a little bit.",Negative
28,"This movie has 1,5 stars because some rewievers find it funny to give this wreck 10 stars. it don't even deserve that much. i knew it would be horrible. it's a movie about emoji's. nothing good can come out from such a bad idea. but it was actually worse than i expected. usually i can laugh about atleast something or find some jokes clever. this movie had none of those moments. and the ""vague"" hints of a femenist message really didn't help. who's brilliant idea was it that the female character should say ""You know, women are always coming up with stuff, that men are taking credit for"" when she didn't even say it. sure it was implied that was her idea but it's so stupid to make it about men taking womens ideas. and it was even more obvious what the movie wanted you to think when yet again the female character says later in the movie ""im not going to be a princess waiting for my prince charming"" overall a horrible movie with alot stolen from other movies and what's originat is unfunny and bad. don't watch it",Negative
29,The movie's message is that communication among people is failing and can only be saved by texting with more emojis.How about face to face conversations?,Negative
30,"The movie starts off with a horrible intro. The whole is just a cliche, and the plot is what you expect, an emoji goes around a lot of apps we use, and they use ""subtle"" hints to women's rights. There's a fine line between a child's movie, and a fake PG movie. This movie crosses it, many time over.",Negative
31,Perfect story telling where you use no original ideas or settings or characters or lines or jokes. So you don't have to use the two Brain cells you have!,Negative
32,Best. mocie. ever. period. no cap. the goat of movies.,Negative
33,"So I've just watched this with my kids and expected to have to claw my eyes out or catch up with some sleep while it was on. But its not that bad.from the reviews I've seen and the universal 1/10 rating i literally expected this to be unwatchable, or extremely poorly made to the point of looking like a mess - spykids 3 or something. Its about the same kind of level as any of a dozen direct to DVD 'specials' I've seen this year.Its basically a budget retread of the lego movie. Emojis try to escape from a smartphone by crossing through apps on the homescreen to get to 'the cloud' which they will access via dropbox. Some of the product placement is fairly crass but no worse than the lego movie and not as bad as many reviews I've read have implied. The characters get trapped in versions of candy crush and lets dance. Quite a lot of it is negative to the apps themselves (ie facebook) and i was surprised a key feature of the story was a 'pirate' app called 'jailbreak'.Its a kids movie, my kids (4 and 7) enjoyed it though one jump scare did get to my 4 year old (a robot unexpectedly grabs a character and snatches them off screen). They enjoyed it, as did the majority of the audience. Only one family left early and thats not unusual in a family screening. I've only ever fallen asleep during one movie in my life (wesley snipes the art of war). This is infinitely better than that movie and that movie gets 5.7? Go figure.",Negative
34,"This movie is aimed at children, and my daughter enjoyed it a lot. While the movie wasn't great or even really good for an adult, it was nowhere close to as bad as Angry Birds or Boss Baby. I expect it to be worse than most of the non-Disney, non-Pixar stuff. I saw one reviewer compare it unfavorably to Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out, but come on, why is that comparison even being made? Those are GREAT movies in their genre. This is a 5. It held my attention without irritating me, while my 4 year old enjoyed herself. Jokes didn't all hit, but the inside the phone software metaphors was more on the mark than the vast majority of live action portrayals of virtual worlds. Frankly I think the script needed maybe a couple more rounds of rewrites and it would have been above average.",Negative
35,"At one point in the movie they were facing the firewall. It was a pit bull song where it says ""Im a fireball"" when it clearly should've been 'Im a firewall'.Overall the movie was 'meh'.",Negative
36,"This film is more than a film. It's art. Out of the many outstanding qualities the themes are the most impressive. It serves as a reflection on our own society, the breaking of norms and the oppressive Orwellian government pushing what's different down. True authenticity is a rarity in our culture, with the transcendent message of the film and the innovative concept and animation. The way this film was done has never been done before. Ever. There is literally nothing like it. Focusing instead on making a masterpiece rather than making money, instead of being an half assed ad like Anomalisa. The Emoji restores my faith in film and in turn restores my faith in humanity. Definitely deserves it's own cinematic universe. 10 out of 10.",Negative
37,"When I first settled down to watch The Emoji Movie, I really didn't think I would enjoy it at all. I just watched it to have a few laughs, at the jokes, and maybe how bad it was; but it's actually pretty damn good.Gene is an emoji that makes more than one expression; a problem, considering he's supposed to be meh. After messing up and having the wrong face when he's scanned, Gene sets out on a mission to become a real emoji, and to only be meh. I personally think that this is a gem of a movie. Of course, it's much less for adults, and any one that's rather anti technology, but this has some serious life lessons in it:1) Friendship is important2) Don't bend to society's rules3) Being you is the best you you can beThere was nothing I really took from it, of course, as I knew these already, but considering this film is aimed at the technology age of children, this is an absolutely brilliant movie to take your kids to see. Maybe you won't enjoy it, but they definitely will, and it will teach them things along the way.Not as good as other movies, such as Inside Out, but this is a gem, and it really does have a lot to it, rather than being an annoying movie marketed on a trend.",Negative
38,"Well maybe this isn't the best animation I have seen, but it has some great moments and the good thing with kids is that they typically transfers their enthusiasm to their surroundings and that makes the experience better :)Location, seating & time: Palads, København, Denmark - Bio 1, row 8 seat 12, 14 & 16 - 03.08.2017 at 14.20",Negative
39,Before seeing this film I had had only 2 girlfriends but now that I can converse about the fine arts I have 28. 10/10 would recommend,Negative
40,This movie is an hour and a half long advertisement. There was no reason or idea behind this movie but rather they needed an excuse to just shamelessly plug things.,Negative
41,"By God, this is a masterpiece. An absolutely gorgeous movie about Gene, an emoji who does not fit in. Join him and his friends as they travel through the phone which does not have obvious distasteful product placements at all! Will he forever be an outsider, or fit in, like what eventually happens in all children's movies? Masterfully executed.This movie only gets 9/10 because it ended. If only it went on evermore, it would get 10/10. Truly, the pinnacle of human civilisation.",Negative
42,"I saw this movie to see how bad it was and it was a terrible, terrible mistake. This movie is basically what would happen if you put Inside Out, Wreck it Ralph, crap, garbage, and an iPhone in a blender, then put it it in the oven, took out the result, nuke it, then put the ashes back in the oven, and the emoji movie comes out. Do not watch this movie! Ever!",Negative
43,"This movie was a mistake in all senses of the word. The animation was pretty good, I'll give it that, but the writing and quality control of the voice acting and screenplay was abysmal. The only benefit to this movie was the reaction of the internet.Sony Pictures Animation has fallen so, very, far.",Negative
44,Trash. That's what this movie is. Don't even bother watching. Save yourself.,Negative
45,"My kids are making me watch this deck on Netfrix as I type this. If the Lord is ready to receive me into His kingdom, I am definitely ready to go.",Negative
46,"This movie is god awful, i don't understand why 6 people rated the movie 10/10 in a row in the 'user reviews', maybe these accounts were created to bump up the ratings of this awful movie, besides, what movie is entertaining with James Cordon in the cast?",Negative
47,Regardless of low rating....it's a very good cartoon with an interesting story and satisfying conclusion,Negative
48,"The Emoji Movie is about the Meh emoji Gene, played by talented actor T.J. Miller. It has everything you'd want out of a movie, conflict, good characters, engaging story and a happy ending. Without spoiling this masterpiece I can tell you that Gene goes through an epic adventure where he grows as an Emoji. I don't have any kids because I hate them, but the kids in the theater seemed to enjoy themselves, even after I ""accidentally"" spilled my soda on them, hahaha. It is definitely worth a watch, if you ask me.-Ya boi Tony",Negative
49,"Even though It has low rating and Is made fun of a lot, It was actually enjoyable! I watched this movie with my friend In theaters and I was thinking It would be an awful movie that I could make fun of but then It was actually pretty enjoyable. There are a few kinda cringy parts such as some of the dancing scenes but it was still an enjoyable movie. My serious rating: 8.5/10",Negative
50,"People, DO NOT listen to the people that gave this film 10/10. It might be obvious that those guys must be paid by Sony to rate this. So try managing your review setting so you can avoid them. But if you want to... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!",Negative
51,Bringin back 2010 in an absolute catastrophy of a movie,Negative
52,"I got so bored while watching it that while it was still playing i made this IMDb account just to rate it 1 star. This movie is the reason why IMDb needs to add a 0 star rating.
There has been an experiment in which a person is shocked when he touches a button, says that he's never going to touch it, then he gets put in a room with the button and they get so bored that they touch the button multiple times just because they have nothing better to do.

57,"The idea of this was great, but by making it the way they did, I will never look at an emoji the same way.In this film, we are treated as if we are brainless drones. Did the makers assume we would not notice that The Emoji Movie is one giant advertisement? Because that is all this movie is. Two tutorials on how to play games, and many demonstrations of how great phone's apps are. I wasted an hour and thirty-one minutes on my life watching this, when I would much rather have been sitting bored at home.The plot was messy and stupid, containing one pathetic joke after the next. The trailer was more entertaining. I will not be surprised if next year, a fidget spinner movie is released.This is also offensive to high-school aged students, as the beginning literally states that as a high-school student, Alex's entire life revolves around his phone. Another thing about that is that all they do 24/7 is text, and all they seem to use are emojis. Are the script-writers saying that all a high-school student does throughout the course of their day is press little icons on his phone to send to others?Why did people fight over creating this monstrosity? People in the year 3017 are going to look back on July 18, 2017 as the year humanity was at its lowest pitfall. Historians will marvel at how a movie that sucked so much managed to sell even one ticket after opening night.I want my life back.",Negative

For weeks, I have been awaiting this gem to arrive at my local theater house. For weeks I have been ranting and raving and just having pure excitement knowing my girl Sophia will be co-starring. The movie is well directed and the score goes right to the heart of my soul. I loved how the movie had credits at the beginning and end. I enjoyed the message and I wasn't let down. I stayed in the theater for 3 consecutive showings until I was removed by the usher. I highly recommend this movie be a part of your legacy.",Negative

I specifically recall the scene where after praising Elliot Rodger as a hero, Gene and Jailbreak tell all LGBT members in the film that they didn't deserve love, then proceed to have a massive orgy with the rest of the characters, which was extremely disturbing and totally inappropriate for children. I can't believe Sony allowed Tony Leondis to get away with this appalling piece of ""cinema"".",Negative

I just feel really bad for all the people who had to suffer watching this movie, I'm just... so sad.Humanity is doomed.Really, humanity is gonna get nowhere with this kind of ""Movie"" (Seriously, how can you even consider this a movie and not just one fat ad?!?)Also, The Emoji Movie's storyboard feels like it was written for 3 minutes until they pitched the idea.

They said ""this is bound to be a meme"" which is a silly word meaning ""the greatest"". My youngest daughter got frightened by the scary viruses, reminiscent of the ones on my Windows Vista. But my other kids ATE IT UP! Very funny plot about the cell phone, also, i love candy crush! They said the day after that Jacksfilms is the movie's biggest fan! But I am reigning supreme!Sincerely,

66,"I went with my 5 year old daughter and we both liked it. It's not excellent but it's an action paced animated movie that feels good.The plot is at least original. Sure it has lots of product placement but it couldn't be otherwise. Actually the movie is all about product placement. But that's OK, that's actually how it relates to the audience that know each app on our smartphone, and you use them everyday. And that's actually what makes it interesting and compelling. How could a movie about your phone be with fake names and fake apps, it wouldn't make sense.However, the action felt like they were just passing each level, from one app to the other until the final destination. And it's not that funny, but it has some nice funny lines that make you smile (but not laugh). My kid laughed a bit with the easy jokes. Positive points for the animation, liked the Instagram bit especially for the really nice 3D feel.Despicable Me 3 is funnier. Cars 3 is more adventurous. But Emoji relates more to the audience and to the real life.",Negative

68,"If you would like to watch an hour and a half long commercial then this is the movie for you. The entire film revolves around these brand deals they were able to acquire such as Candy Crush, Just Dance, and Spotify. Even if it doesn't make sense for the plot and what is happening for these brand deals to be brought in to the movie, they are still included. It's like watching a YouTube video with mid roll ads that interrupt the video.
The plot itself is very common and not nearly as different or interesting enough as many other films with this format. The characters are bland and forgettable since they are literally the same characters as your regular outcast hero characters. If you want to see a good version of this film, watch Wreck It Ralph. While that film isn't the exact same as this, it is quite similar and much more intriguing and interesting. I can't even think of a single thing I liked about this film, that's just how bad it was.",Negative
69,"As you probably know, this movie is notorious for being absolute garbage in every aspect except for the animation, which is literally the only decent thing about this movie. Now, I had been wanting to see this movie for a while now. Not because I actually thought I'd enjoy any of it, but because I wanted to see just how garbage it is for myself. So I turned on the TV, went to Netflix, and put on The Emoji Movie.
And oh BOY does it live up to the level of garbage that everyone says it is.
I can't even say much about the entirety of the movie, because I got literally 14 minutes into the movie and already regretted my decision to watch it. It's so unfunny and the ""plot"" (I use that loosely) just doesn't make sense. Also, it has SO MUCH PRODUCT PLACEMENT, including TWO GAME TUTORIALS. IT'S JUST SO BAD. So, 14 minutes in and I said, ""No. I don't want to sit through this anymore. I can't."", and promptly stopped the movie. It's utter garbage in pretty much every aspect. Please don't waste any of your life watching this cesspool of garbage, you won't enjoy it and the only entertainment you could get out of it is ironic stuff that wasn't meant to be funny in the way it is, and even then it'll only give you a small chuckle.

Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse
Shrek
Shrek 2
The majority of Disney/Pixar Films
Avengers: Endgame

71,I find it strange how most of the 10/10 come from accounts that have only rated this movie.,Negative
72,"Pros:
-The movie, as bad as it is, actually looks pretty great. Shoutout to the animation team for at least trying to make this movie have any redeeming qualities.
-There is like, two or three good ideasCons:
-Even without all of the other cons, this movie would've still been a predictable, unoriginal, cliched, boring, and forgettable piece of (poop emoji)
-The writing is INFURIATINGLY awful. I had to pause the movie so many times to let the stupidity sink in.
-The ""jokes"", if you can call them that, are all either bad visual gags or awful ""puns"" that don't even make sense half of the time. There were a few times when I was a little close to laughing, and two times when I genuinely laughed, but the rest of it is garbage.
-This movie has some of the worst product placement I have ever seen. They weren't trying to be even a little subtle, it just felt like I was watching a big ad for a bunch of apps, with an awful movie in between the ads.
-The characters are bad. Gene is just an uninteresting ""meh"" protagonist. High-five is very annoying, and I don't buy his friendship with Gene at all. He just seemed to tag along on the adventure for his own personal gain that I didn't care about. Jailbreak is a somewhat boring character who randomly spouts out feminist remarks from time to time, and does some EXTREMELY out of character things near the end of the movie. Again, I don't buy her relationship with Gene, but at least it isn't the most forced in relationship I've ever seen.
-This movie doesn't seem to have rules. Here are some examples (minor spoilers):
""He is going to go to the phone store to delete us tomorrow!"" After what seems like a few minutes in the movie's time: ""We only have 4 hours before the phone is deleted!""
""We have to travel to the other side of the phone to get to the trash to save High Five from being deleted!"" Later: ""Here, I can pull up this email you found and left in the trash on my screen.""
Not to mention, a large amount of things that happen in the movie are just not how phones work at all. Also, many plot holes and things that didn't make sense were created just to throw in more ads.
-There were some subplots, but I din't care at all about them. At least they were breaks from the infuriating main plot
-The voice acting is sub-standardI know there are worse movies out there, but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't watch this ad that is calling itself a movie. It is not so bad it's good, it's just infuriating, and it will be forgotten within a year or two.",Negative
73,This movie if great for kids. I enjoy watching it too. The only thing that sort of bothered me is the underlying message. It has a little of the PC feel but doesn't push it too hard. You know the everybody's trying to stay in their expected social cues and anyone that breaks from the patriarch will be hunted down and killed! That PC. But your kids will love it and shouldn't read between the lines. I ask you not to either. Just enjoy the movie for what it is.

78,"""The Emoji Movie"" is notorious for being awful. And, considering I love to occasionally watch an awful film in order to get a good laugh, I decided to finally see this piece of dreck. Overall, it was a terrible movie but perhaps not as terrible as I expected. It ended up being more tedious than painful to watch.So what's wrong with this movie? The writing. Despite the film being all about emojis, the writers managed to hit every possible cliche a kids movie could use. And, considering these are emojis, it just didn't make sense to stick so close to a rather overused formula. Additionally, the film had what seemed like hundreds of jokes relating to computers and social media....and each and every one of them fell flat. And, several of these 'jokes' involved the poop emoji. This is because in none of these was there even a hint of humor or cleverness. I noticed one review where the reviewer gives this one a 10. That's like saying that a velvet Elvis painting belongs in the Louvre!",Negative

It just may not be worth the price of renting lolEnjoy.",Negative
88,"To be honest, I saw The Emoji Movie only to understand why it gets so much hate. As a Redditor I understand why I am supposed to hate this movie (because...emojis?), but why does the normie audience hate it? Isn't this movie supposed to be like, their dream come true? Don't they always keep spamming emojis in all their sentences when writing a message or making a meme? When the movie hadn't come out it was being advertised a lot, so I thought people are supposed to be excited. Even the animation of this movie seemed really good. But I watched it and now I know the problem.The Emoji Movie is very ignorant. It talks about emojis as if it is supposed to be something very cool. In reality only elders, women and children use emojis when they message (because they are the only ones we can't slap some sense into). But then again the target audience here is the children. So considering this movie is from their point of view, emojis are supposed to be shown as though they mean a lot to them. So let's come to the second point. The emojis are shown to have their entire personality revolving around their expression. Why can't they just be doing their job? Also how come so many emojis look similar? Is it like only one of them goes to the emoji keyboard while the others have no business? There are so many questions that the movie doesn't answer.I don't know which problem plagues this movie the most. Is it the product placement? No, it just gives a feeling of adventure. None of the product placement looks as much on the nose as everyone describes. Like in TVF Originals they straight up speak out to advertise the things. Here at least Gene and Hi-5 are going to those places to see what is happening over there. I kinda found the Candy Crush part funny and relaxing at the same time. There was also the Just Dance part, and that was definitely cringy. But that was the only cringy one. Facebook, Skype, Drop Box - everything else was quite decent.The jokes weren't half as bad, considering this is aimed for kids. Even I used to make many poop jokes when I was 13. If there even was anything bad, the animation and music compensated for it. The idea that there are so many emojis that we can establish and entire world using it is actually something I'm guessing everyone must have thought at some point. The one part that I surely felt was cringy was when the kid gets to ask out his crush because he sent her a custom emoji. Only if life functioned that easily. Hi-5 was also pretty disgusting. Every time he kept his hand (thumb) down it used to hurt me. Imagine bending your thumb down that much. Also when he ate the salivated candy I felt like vomiting.The Emoji Movie is a bad movie, yes, but it's still better than many animated movies I have seen. Food Fight, Delhi Safari, Roadside Romeo, Geng: The Adventure Begins, Pangaa Gang, the entire Super Bheem series - there are plenty of examples of animated movies that are even worse than this. It does have redeeming qualities, even if they are not enough to make this a genuinely good movie. I can imagine the animators must have worked hard on this movie even if they didn't agree with the script. And that is the reason why I have massive respect for them.",Negative
89,"To be honest it wasn't so bad, the emojis animation looks good, but the whole thing reminds me about wreck it Ralf, but more lame. Because wreck it Ralf has a whole story line and a lot more memes and wider perspective, while this movie is only a childish entertainment which is really a bad choice. Here's why: who do you think will watch this movie? Sure, adults might understand the jokes inside about internet and stuff but not really, and the whole story line is weird and the love between jailbreak and Jean is awkward, super awkward. If you say this is for kids, no because they can't even understand the memes and jokes about internet and social medias, it's just boring for them. And for teenagers? It's just lame.",Negative

The animation was good the pasting was òke it was very colorful almost neon a clear sign that this movie is for very small children. The story is simple easy to follow for kids.

94,"I watched this movie before I have even heard or read any critic reviews or ratings about it. So I walked into the cinema with an open mind and high expectations.
And wouldn't you know it, I was severely disappointed at this movie. The movie struggled so hard to create funny moments which turned out to be cringy attempts at humor (especially the dance sequence).
Don't get me wrong, I was impressed by the great animation, and that's the only good thing about this movie. I feel sorry for the animators who have put in so much effort into this junk of a movie.
I feel like I shoudn't even call this a movie or a film. The Emoji Movie feels like an 86-minute advertisement with bland, cheesy, cringy dialogue and lazy writing. Other animated movies (for example the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy and the Toy Story trilogy) in comparison have so much more effort put into them.
""But this is made for children! You're over-analysing it!""
So are you saying that we shouldn't judge children films? Are you saying that every single movie made for children is great/perfect? According to this logic, Food Fight and Cool Cat Saves the Kids deserve 10/10, don't they? The target demographic of this movie does not, and will not, affect the fact that this movie is horrible. I'm so tired of hearing this excuse.
By the way, if you say that this is the best movie you have ever watched, you're paid by Sony or the director of this movie to write a positive review, or you're sarcastic, or this is the only film you have ever watched. Go watch the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, Toy Story trilogy and others and see if they change your mind.
Overall, the only positive aspect of this 'movie' is it's animation, but i's quickly overwhelmed by the negative aspects (writing, plot, characters, development, etc.).

I consider myself to be an adult and even I could relate to some of the messages that this film tried to convey and even appreciated their attempts, as cheesy as they may have been, at humour. This film does in no way warrant the hate reviews that it has been receiving as of late.

Oh sure, the FORMULA for a Best Picture winner! I SERIOUSLY wonder just what exactly was going through the minds of the people who worked on this! Let's be honest: among movies considered the worst, there's The Room, which quite frankly puts a smile on my face, and then there's this load'o'crap, a systematic brain-drain!

104,"When I first read the news that there is an animated full-length feature film being developed called ""The Emoji Movie"", I took my hand and forcefully applied it to my forehead. This movie was absolutely uncalled for, yes, we do live in a generation where everyone has a phone or computer and sends each other instant messages, sometimes adding emoticons to reflect their state, but that doesn't justify the need for it. What made sense to pour out $50 million into making this picture? And how come it ended up making over $250 million at the box office? It's beyond comprehension....""The Emoji Movie"" centers on a city called Textopolis, which is basically in everyone's smartphone, and the residents of Textopolis are various emojis that have a daily job of making faces and emotions whenever the phone user selects one of them in a text message.The main character is Gene Meh, a...""Meh"" emoji that doesn't like to stick to the norm of one single emotion and is targeted for deletion due to his multi-expressions. He bands up with other malfunctioned emojis in order to escape from the software agents that are hunting them and find the Code to fix Gene. The adventure takes them through various apps like Just Dance, Candy Crush or Instagram. The film is literally a marketing gimmick for phone apps.
The fact that Sir Patrick Stewart appears in the film as the Poop emoji had me worried for a bit, but fortunately his appearance is short and minor.The animations aren't half-bad, but that's about the only good part of the movie. All the jokes fall flat, there was not a single moment where I actually laughed.
Judging by the targeted audience of teens and pre-teens, I expected to have more triumph over toys and merchandise, but it didn't really pick up.""The Emoji Movie"" is a film that shouldn't have been made and instead should have invested the budget into something else.",Negative
105,"...it still is one of the worst movies of Sony Pictures Animation, along with 'The smurfs: the lost village'.I was very excited when I saw that a movie about emojis was going to come out, because almost my entire generation loves them, including me. And I read the synopsis which promised a nice and funny premise. But then, at its release day here in Mexico, I found out because of a meme (yes, really) something strange about it: its terrible and crappy ratings and reviews at Rotten Tomatoes and also here in IMDb. I mean, I have seen lots of good films that have a 4 or even a 3 as rating, but 1.5 was...a bit too much for me.And well, despite of knowing that I probably was going to see a real piece of sh*t of movie, I took my seat throwing to the trash for a while all the bad things that everyone was saying about 'The emoji movie'. And yes, I saw the probable reasons why to hate this movie, particularly two of them: one, it was at times a bit slow; and two, the jokes were at times silly and unfunny, especially for one of the main audiences this movie was meant to be directed: teens. Because all the things we teens consider funny nowadays contain bad words, and as this movie is meant also for children, that includes the jokes which, at least I as a teenager, felt them a bit old-fashioned.But anyway, I don't really think it deserved such harsh ratings, as there have been worse movies of its type, and, believe it or not, it is funny and entertaining at times, and the emojis made the experience worthwhile for me. In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this one as one of the best animated movies of the year, but anyway, I would suggest you that, if you want to see it, do it, but not with very high expectations, but still, without reading the bad reviews. Thanks for reading!",Negative

The characters are so one dimensional that I only needed to see the extended movie trailer to know the motivations and personalities of each character. There is the main character, going about his life until one day, he messes up his job and needs to climb back up to his position where he could save the day. On the way, he has a love interest with a troubled past, the idiotic sidekick that means well and tries to help the main character but just gets in the way. There is the Den of Deplorables where the scum and the forgotten reside. Then, there is the constant ""threat"" overhanging the world that has the possibility of destroying their community if the character does not hurry up. Then there is an impenetrable obstacle in the way that blocks the character's path of least resistance. Finally, there is the scene where the love interest and main character go through a beautiful scene where they both learn that there is a meaning to life (for example, look at Wall-e.) Finally, the main character gets the girl, solves the problem, and everyone is saved. It is the most carbon copy coming-of-age story imaginable. Don't see this movie. Not even ironically.

I felt bad for the future generations because when you published this movie, you proved that there is no hope left on earth, and you have opened the gates of hell when this movie was published. What is the next movie going to be? The Snapchat Movie: The rise of the Hotdog filter? Also, this movie is the reason why I've lost the will to live. If you have $20 for a ticket for this movie, just spend it to cancer charities, so cancer like this gets cured and nobody has to watch this 💩!!!

The movie is so stunningly bad it will be the major talking point, in hushed and serious tones akin to talking about a new and unstoppable strain of Ebola, across all known and unknown media. It is an extinction level event all by itself. Someone actually sat down and penned this terminal cancer. I had to sit down through the entire sad affair because it was too horrible not to. This movie is the '45 Hiroshima and Nagasaki of your soul.",Negative
111,"The Emoji Movie...boy am I embarrassed to have seen this thing. This movie essentially has an A and B plot that work off each other. The A plot is about a 'meh' emoji named Gene who is able to make multiple other expressions. When working at the cube, he messes up terribly by making a face other than a 'meh'. With his new friend Hi-5 and a hacker named Jailbreak, they must find a way to transform him into a 'normal' emoji by journeying through the smartphone. The B plot revolves around a freshman named Alex who tries to get the attention of Addie McCallister by sending her emojis...When I first found out about this movie I thought it was a joke. I just thought it was an April Fools Day prank pulled by Sony, but when the trailer for this movie arose in December, I feared for the worst...I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with the A plot. You may notice that it sounds really familiar, and it does. It sounds like the plot of Wreck-It Ralph. Just from the second trailer I knew that we would get a Wreck-It Ralph vibe. That's essentially what the concept of the A plot is. It's like they took the concept of warping from world to world presented in that movie and put it in a smartphone. The movie doesn't even go in-depth into what Gene's condition is. It just tells you that Gene can express multiple emotions and expect you to roll with it. All that does is bring analytic viewers to question the ideas of the movie. When it comes to the A plot though, it's just linear, predictable and unpleasant to sit through.Hi-5 is a pointless character. All he does is act as the comic relief, and he even fails at that, as he didn't make me laugh once throughout the picture. The jokes in this movie are all cringeworthy. None of them hit. There were kids in the theater who hardly laughed at all, that's how bad these jokes were. There was only one joke that made me laugh and even that one will eventually become dated.The product placement is incredibly annoying. Throughout the movie we see many different real world apps like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and even Candy Crush. I just felt cheap looking at these and many parts of the movie felt like advertisements for smartphone apps. They even try to be ""cool and hip"" with the kids. There is modern slang usage, movie references and even references to songs that went viral two to three years ago. For example, they play the Nae Nae song by Silento in hopes that kids in the audience can relate. You're not relating to your audience, you're pandering to them. It's not like in Wreck-It Ralph, for instance, where they bring in classic video game icons for viewers to relate to. The difference of bringing these different products in is that the classic video game icons are timeless, while the Nae Nae song became dated.There's also a sub-plot that I won't spoil that feels so pointless, and I say this for two reasons. One, the movie only cuts to that part twice. Second, the characters involved in said plot point don't get anywhere new.As for the B plot, it's probably the best part of this entire film, which isn't saying anything. The characters outside the smartphone are boring, but at least they're not annoying like the emojis. The animation for those scenes looks pretty good for the most part. Even saying that the B plot is the best part isn't saying much. Even the way that plot ends feels predictable.If you are a kid who is really into emojis, chances are that you will enjoy this film. Even at that, I don't think anyone else would enjoy it, just small kids to early teenagers. It's a terrible animated feature that's down there with Norm of the North that's unfunny, linear, empty, full of product placement and is just awful.2/10",Negative

It wasn't the predictable and recycled plot. The worst part about this movie is that at one point, a group of executives sat together in a board room and thought, ""What's something hip and cool that kids like?"" and they all collectively agreed that and EMOJI movie would be the best idea.At one point I was in the middle of watching this and I came to the sad realization that I was watching a movie about EMOJIS.

I found it interesting maybe not really funny but some jokes were dark and not for kids which was kind of creepy but still the plot is nice.

120,"There was no plot, character development was nonexistent. Product placement was everywhere. The romance was also so amazingly disappointing, and probably shouldn't have even been in the movie. I doubt I will ever have children knowing that they will grow up in a world where this is seen as actual entertainment and not a pile of poop emoji. This isn't a 50 million dollar movie, and looked like it had the budget of your average Bollywood film. I doubt I'll ever see an emoji the same way, as this mentally and emotionally scarred me to the point that I feel emotions have become obsolete. Overall, the movie was an utter waste of money. I give it 2 OK hand emojis out of 5.",Negative
121,"The Emoji Movie (2017) 1/2 (out of 4)Gene is a young emoji who is expected to be his ""blah"" self but he doesn't want to do that so he sets out to try and free himself to where he can be whatever emoji he wants.THE EMOJI MOVIE pretty much got a hefty beating even before it got released. The early reviews were beyond awful and many called the film one of the worst ever made. The film would still get a theatrical release but even the normal family friendly folks were pretty harsh on it. Sadly, my 2-year-old daughter loves to watch the film so I've had to sit there and cringe as she laughs.I must admit that I'm going to join the group of people who thinks this is a truly awful movie. One of the worst movies ever made? I wouldn't say that but I will say that it's one of the very worst animated movies ever made and in fact it might be the very worst that I've seen. As of writing this, I can't think one of animated movie that I have hated more than this one.There's no doubt that the biggest issue with this movie is the writing. The screenplay is deadly dull and it pretty much hits every cliche that you'd expect from an animated movie. The animation business is really booming now with some terrific and original films but this here is not it. THE EMOJI MOVIE really comes across as something no one put any effort into because they knew they could release it and the thing would make money.The only good thing that can be said about the picture is that the animation is wonderful. With that said, the rest of the movie is just pure boredom that has one awful joke after another and the characters are beyond lame and boring.",Negative
122,"I honestly can't say that I'm surprised AT ALL by the reactions of this movie, because this was met with almost universal disdain from the pitch alone. This is almost like a parody movie that you'd find in a Family Guy cutaway or something, not an actual product that should exist on this planet. Hey, have you seen Inside Out and/or Wreck-it Ralph? Good, you got yourself a double feature that you can watch instead of paying money to go see $50 MILLION get set on fire and watch it burn to ashes for 85 minutes. This movie has only one of very, very few redeeming traits, and it is this: ANYONE can get their movie in theaters, regardless of talent, quality, or entertainment value for ages 2 and under; if you throw enough money at it, you too can play the same weekend as Atomic Blonde with the smug attitude of ""Yes, people (with common sense) will see this.""",Negative

I always enjoy it when people put easter eggs like that in their movie. So this is my conclusion: if you're ill and too tired to watch more complicated movies, this is kind of nice.

128,"Hoping to see any redeeming qualities of this movie's very negative buzz, can't say I was able to when I did. The animation quality, visual setting, and adding a few real-life app names looks inviting on the outside, but upon entering its world and inner workings, it was a waste and abysmal to take seriously as a ""movie."" As though it poorly replicated Pixar's Inside Out concept crossed with the technological theme of Disney's Wreck-It Ralph.I've seen plenty of animated features as both a kid and as an adult, but this is one you'd probably not want to see at a movie theater. It's pretty much a desperate, by-the-numbers cash grab done by all things Sony Animation, who had produced a few SO much better animated titles in the past.In the city of Textopolis, an emoji called Gene (T.J. Miller) is designed to be like his parents (both ""meh"" icons), but for some reason he has multiple ways of expressing himself in the smartphone of young teen Alex that it confuses those around him and his own user. Hoping to find his place, he goes on an adventure with female emoji hacker Jailbreak (Anna Faris) to have a true purpose in his user's data space.Director Tony Leondis said he was greatly inspired by Toy Story's concept, but his approach in using that for emojis doesn't work if the story squanders it with a predictable ending and difficult-to-like, cardboard characters. Other films that used the concept like say, Wreck-It Ralph and The LEGO Movie had a premise and morals that weren't questionable or inane. No. Instead, those movies emitted both the mythos and pathos in an intriguing and creative way. I don't blame the movie's voice cast at all for this mistake, it's the ""story"" that was unoriginal and a hodgepodge, including jokes that were too juvenile to find as funny.Overall, this'll attract the littler ones, but this flick is best suited as direct-to-DVD, not theater worthy.",Negative
129,"In today's world, the phone isn't used quite as the inventors pictured, with actual calling being replaced by texting and snapchat. But one item has been developed to replace the words that are too difficult to write: Emojis. In desperation, Sony has developed a film about these icons in an attempt to break the bank with another hit animated series. Can they succeed, or will this movie be nothing but a bombardment of sad faced emojis? Robbie K here to answer that question for you with another review. LIKES:The Animation: You can say a lot of negative things about the movie, but one plus for this reviewer is the beautiful display Sony's team has designed. Like many movies, the characters move with fluid grace, transitioning through their adventure with little jumpiness. High Five (James Corden) in particular has impressive moves, as having a hand expand beyond simple hand movements can be tricky business. In addition, I enjoyed the visualization of the world within our phone, finding clever design in the development of the internal universes of each app (primarily Instagram's frozen pictures). I'll admit, the characters aren't realistic like Pixar, or even super creative design, but there is cleverness in the world itself. It's Cute: When it comes to cartoons/animated marvels, the pendulum can swing to either side of the age spectrum. Fear not those with little kids, this movie is certainly geared towards the younger side, filled to the brim with color, simplistic jokes, and over the top slapstick that will make many giggle. Sure, there are a few drier jokes that adults will get, but for the most part this movie goes back to basics for family friendliness. One won't have to worry about inappropriate gestures or innuendos in this film. The Morals: Movies are a powerful tool to teach the lessons we humans are too ignorant to learn from mentors, school, and the quickly fading trend of reading. Emoji's movie solid lesson of being yourself and not conforming to the traditional ways is as good rehash of the traditional lesson. Those who stand out from the norm will find great relevance to Gene (T.J. Miller) and Jailbreak's (Anna Faris) quest and most likely grab on to the characters. It's also always good to see a lesson in friendship as well, quoting the movie as ""Better to have one good friend, than a bunch of fake fans followers"". The strong emphasis on this will hopefully break through the persistent firewalls of your subconscious and get you contacting your buddies. DISLIKES:Story: Despite the morals infused into the story, the overall quality of Gene's tale is very basic at best. The Emoji movie has little sustenance to it, diving more into cramming the jokes in the short run time. After all the world building I had hoped for a little more depth to navigating the apps, facing the dangers of the cyber terror that lurk in our phones. I wanted suspense! I wanted exploration of a selection of apps. I wanted an adventure that had a little more depth behind it. I got very little of that. All the obstacles they faced were fairly easy to circumvent, and often not worth mentioning at how lame they were. Certainly, they did a few things right (Just Dance 4), but for the most part, it was a huge loss of potential at decoding the craziness of our obsession with phones. Humor: Humor can be fun when balanced, but unfortunately Emoji movie lacks that balance, once again swinging the pendulum to the younger audience. Most of the jokes are very simple statements that lack any finesse, or decent delivery to maximize the laughs. Much of the humor is dry, and although has adult components, lacks that clever zing that other films/programs do. James Corden rectifies this a little with High Fives self-absorbed personality, but even his banter gets stale after a while. With all of the comedians in this movie, I really had expected more of this movie, but again missed potential. Boring: If you haven't gleamed it from the first two categories, then this should sum this up, Emoji movie is boring. There is no suspense to the adventure, and let's face it no point, to the challenges at hand. I found myself looking at the clock wondering how much longer I had in the ridiculous presentation of smart phone gimmicks. Cute is always great, but it is better left to YouTube and Kid shows that are in short spans of time. Without the jokes to back it up, nor an impressive voice performance, there is just little to scream entertainment outside of watching a child's smile light up at the colorful presentation. The VERDICT:You've seen the reviews of my colleagues, and they aren't far from the truth Emoji movie was a miss for Sony in terms of quality. The lackluster jokes, lack of challenge, and reserved wit were not the right steps to take in this inconsistent adventure for success. In fact, the best thing of this film is the animated short for Hotel Transylvania that precedes it. Still, if you are looking for a safe, family trip to the movies, you've got the Emoji movie to save your bacon. However, I highly recommend reserving this one for Netflix. My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 4.0 Movie Overall: 2.0",Negative

This is a poor choice for kids, poor choice for adults, and poor choice for everyone in between. The movie simply has no appeal to -anyone-. I'd hold up Emoji Movie as a shining example that a string a cheap Sega Dreamcast game on the big screen.For children, I can't see the appeal. The handful of jokes in the movie are mostly pop-culture references and poop jokes--most of which will probably sail right over kids' heads--and overly predictable gags throughout. Even then, the jokes that do remain aren't particularly funny: a donut's babies parodying that cereal from ""See Spot Run"" and that's it, or one of the characters quotes a line from Pulp Fiction during what's supposed to be a sad moment.For adults, I definitely don't see the appeal. Besides the trite jokes, the plot is so predictable and irritating that it grates on one's nerves. There is a -bit- of redemption with being able to hear Patrick Stewart and James Cordon's voices, but their lines are so awful that it just begs the question of what possessed them to bother with The Emoji Movie in the first place. Beyond that, the characters themselves are very flat, all of which have stock personalities, and there is absolutely zero development of any of them, not even to reflect the 'moral of the story'.There is no highlight to this movie whatsoever. It's not even worth a Netflix rental. Avoid it altogether and save yourself the 85 minutes. KF.",Negative

140,"Boy what a piece of 💩! There is absolutely no reason for this movie to exist - none. To make a movie about Legos or Transformers or My Little Pony is one thing, but making an entire movie about the text app on your phone is the equivalent of making a movie called The Secret Life of Smoke Signals. The fact that the movie centers on the ""😕"" emoji is, in a way, kind of ironic. ""😕,"" is quite literally the best thing you can say about this movie. The worst you can say, is it made this reviewer want to 🤢.The (ugh) Emoji Movie follows a few days in the life of Gene Meh (Miller), an Emoji who for some reason doesn't have the ability to do a ""Meh"" on cue. As a result of a first day screw up, Gene becomes a social pariah and risks deletion unless he can find a code that will change his programming for the better...I guess. Along for the ride is former user favorite High-Five (Corden), and the mysterious Hacker named Jailbreak (Farris) who isn't who she says she is but her big, third act reveal means little, and does little other than prop up a cynical Twitter ad.To the surprise of absolutely no one, The Emoji Movie is chalked full of low-hanging fruit when it comes to jokes and basic story elements. But what is surprising is there's so little of anything actually going on. For real though! In between page long exposition dumps, plot contrivance dumps and forced, cringe-worthy youth-oriented vocab dumps, the jokes seem to be spewing at 30% capacity and the plot seems barely alive. It's essentially a movie of surface level dynamics and empty space.What little we have to grab onto in this godforsaken movie is Meh's ambiguously set up heroes journey. A journey that literally takes him, his friends and his family through Facebook, Youtube, Spotify and Dropbox because, you know, what's a movie like this without cat videos, malware updates, bad pop music and ""thumbs up"" stickers. There's also a trek through Candy Crush which not only feels uninspired but does the unthinkable in taking a beat to actually explain the game lest someone in the audience still holds onto their rotary. It all reaches peak stupidity when Meh manages to travel to ""the cloud"" thanks largely to his ability to make faces and remember the name of the girl the phone's user is obsessed with.The final act makes no sense but trust me, by the point Meh makes his return to Textopolis (no joke, the Emojis live in Textopolis), the movie is so far gone, you'll just be glad it's a few minutes from wrapping up. When it finally does wrap up the only question you'll probably be asking yourself is, ""am I angry that I saw this movie, or am I just angry that it wasted my time?"" With a threadbare story and failing significantly to reach already low expectations, The Emoji Movie is arguably the worst movie of the summer. And this is the same summer that brought us the The Mummy (2017) and that's say something! Everything it does has been done before and better, and what it manages to do differently is so cynically implemented and poorly thought out. This isn't a movie, it's a tweet that's grown sentient.",Negative

Next time, stick with a Popeye movie.Now, this review Is just my rant about how much I wanted it to fail. But if I were to put a REAL review in, it'd be this: This is one of the most cliché movies of all time.

Emoji movie is about the imaginary world inside your phone, so they used several widely-used apps throughout the movie to transport us through this phone world. It's not entirely unclever.

Film ""critics"" are so anti-conventional and anti- pop culture that they're hating for hating's sake, and then you get those pretentious middle-aged people and ""meta"" youngsters to follow them.
Simply put, it's a cliché coming-of-age story about a boy who doesn't fit in and cannot meet the societal expectations. Being a failure & outcast, he manages to befriend a person who accepts him and helps him find a possible solution. Eventually he meets a girl who's also not a social norm and helps him embrace who he is.This movie is not hard to understand, not repulsive or atrocious, and not an abomination; on top of that it has somewhat imaginative visual aspects. There are many worse movies out there (Woody Woodpecker being the most recent one I watched), which may have ACTUAL nonsensical story, worse dialog, really REALLY bad acting, or poke-my-eyes-out special effects. This is not worth the 1 star rating or the 10/100, so quit your whining -_-",Negative
150,"This ""movie"" (if that's what this horrendous animation was) earned a 3.2 and absolutely deserved it in every way. It made me cringe and waste some perfect money to see this glob of trash. If this movie deserves a 10, then I dive off of a cliff. I would never give this a great review, not even for all the cash in the world.",Negative
151,"Yeah, that's about it. The animation looks like some effort went into it. But other than that, it is effectively one of the worst animated movies of all time. Heck, it's one of the worst movies of all time. It will be remembered for how bad it is in future years, so there's that.But 1 year later, Sony produced SpiderMan: Into the Spiderverse. Literally 0-100 in just one year. Damn Sony pictures animation......",Negative
152,"I'm only here to stretch the fact that although the movie has a bunch of production flaws including, wrong timed lines where pauses were needed, predictable story, empty characters and all and all a movie that's constantly on the verge of being boring, it has its pros too.I felt the animation, soundtrack and voices were really good and there was certainly a great deal of talent behind them. The movie on its own will likely be amusing to most young children (which i hope was the target audience) but other than that, i don't believe an older teen or adult would find this as enjoyable as the other animations available. The movie has been slandered and insulted in many ways and at this point I'm referring back to my Summary Title:Bad, but not the worst.",Negative
153,"People that are like: ""The Emoji movie is better then Inside out"" are brainwashed, and should stop supporting movies that copy-and-paste original movies like Lego movie.Sony, if your reading this, Please stick to being a video game company.",Negative
154,The movie business is over now. The emoji movie has made every other movie obsolete. I bet that even Scorsese changed the meaning of 'cinema' films after watching this movie. We have reached the epitome of cinema.The emoji movie is 10/10 true kino.,Negative
155,"First of all this is a good movie! When i saw the trailer for this the first time, it gave me a warm feeling and it felt like this movie is something special. After it came out in the theaters, it started to get awful reviews saying it's the worst movie of all time. So i starting to second guess my gut reaction from the trailer. I however said NO, i won't believe the movie is that bad, so i went to see it anyway.It's a movie about a Emoji that is not like everyone else but wants to fit in so badly(kind of remind me of The Lego Movie). When he messes up the the chat with the wrong emoji all hell breaks loose. There is a lot of fun moments and uses the actual apps, that many know an love. If you have any know how on the net you know characters like trolls and alike. It even have a great message for us and the kids(unlike Planes...).I can't see how this movie is in the garbage bin, and maybe it's the message of the movie that people lost. Don't be sheeple make up your own mind. I've seen so much worst movies(even though this is a good one) that i fail to see the hate for this. But haters will be haters.",Negative
156,"Saw it on July 28 midnight premiere. In film industry, marketing is notorious, there are times that it works, and sometimes you are hoping to die while seeing the film. The LEGO movie did an amazing job promoting a product but Emojis aren't even a product, there are only faces that actually doesn't have a story, they are only representing emotions, so this could have been the big problem to this movie being a piece of s***. The characters in this movie are stereotyped and don't make any sense for example the main character is the one that is consent of what they are doing and have some moral, then there is a friend of the main character is the typical stupid that doesn't help with anything. The story is the worst, seriously WTF, is an story that we saw a lot of times, the typical things that you use every day have a secret life OMG i never saw that premise (Toy Story, A bugs life, Secret life of pets). But the worst of this film are the jokes, is the wanna be bizarre we saw in LEGO movie but bad executed. Conclussion: Don't give money to this piece of s***, if you want to see it download it by torrent. But even if this movie was free i wouldn't watch it mother of god what a bad experience.",Negative
157,"I was fortunate enough (and by that I mean unfortunate enough) to see The Emoji Movie before it's official release date. It was awful. I do not recommend this movie AT ALL. Its morals are forced, most of the jokes are terrible, and it's completely cliché. I didn't expect it to be good, and I was right. Don't see this movie.",Negative
158,"After reading these reviews, I came to the conclusion that 99% of the 201 reviewers so far did not actually see the movie.What they actually did was wait for the movie's release, then they RAN to their computers to write bad reviews about Why They Hate Sony Pictures and Why They Hate The Idea Of The Movie ... without having seen it at all.So, don't waste your time reading reviews... yet. I'm going to go watch it anyway. I don't expect a major blockbuster mega billions hit, why should I? Do you?",Negative
159,"When I first saw the trailer in May, I instantly knew the creation of this garbage was a mistake. Now I know I was correct. The characters are bland, the story is cliché, and the villain is basically like every other cliché villain. The entire movie just felt like a Wreck It Ralph rip off with emojis instead of popular video game characters. The jokes were not funny at all and there was WAY to much toilet humor in this that even a 7 year old kid who likes toilet humor would be annoyed by it. They listed this movie as ""comedy"" even though literally nobody laughed in the theater I was watching it in, not even some kids. Parents, spare your children from wasting 86 minutes of their life and go do something else with that time. This movie deserves to become a box office bomb and is not worth watching.",Negative
160,"💩Just by writing this review, I probably spent more time on The Emoji Movie than anyone involved with the script. I'm concerned that by calling this a garbage fire, I'll be doing an injustice to garbage fires. This movie sounded like an inane idea when announced, looked terrible in the trailers, nonetheless surprised me by being worse than I expected. If you can envision a place where creativity goes to die this is it. It represents all the worst elements of Sony as a studio and of Hollywood in general.Remember ""Inside Out"" from a couple of years ago? Did you ever imagine what it would be like if that movie replaced all it's imagination with product placement? That's ""The Emoji Movie"" in a nutshell: ""Inside Out"" sans soul.Our main character, Gene (T.J. Miller),is the son of two ""meh"" emojis (Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge) and he too is meant to be a ""meh"". Sadly,if this movie were ""meh"" it would be a vast improvement. He's not a very good ""meh"" and expresses pretty much every emotion except ""meh"". Because of this, the smiley in charge decides he should be deleted. To escape, he runs off into other phone apps. Remember all the interesting locations the character went through in ""Inside Out"", well here each of those locations is nothing more than a product placement. Gene and Hi-5 (James Corden), who gets caught up in the ""adventure"", go to Let's Dance, Candy Crush, Spotify, YouTube, all in an attempt to get to the cloud aka Dropbox. These side quests exist solely to sell products. Sony outpaces other studios in its use of product placement and cross promotion. Thus, ""The Emoji Movie"" serves as a vehicle for Sony Products and nothing more. Honestly, with all the advertisers featured in this movie it probably paid for itself before one film cell existed.I would say the story is bland and predictable, but in truth it's borderline nonexistent. I wouldn't say it's predictable because that would require an interest in the story's future events when I had none. Literally, I could find nothing to praiseworthy about this movie. Even Patrick Stewart as the Poop emoji never had a chance. What was supposed to pass as humor fell flat. Even when journeying to the separate app, the film's lack of creativity overwhelms everything else. To date, ""The Emoji Movie"" is the frontrunner for worst movie of the year.",Negative
161,"It was a cute, quirky movie. Most definitely not the worst movie out there, but definitely a kids movie. My daughter and I watched it and she laughed the whole time.",Negative
162,Oh boy what do i even say...i knew this movie would be like every other movie but my god i didn't think it would be so bad from immature jokes to just plain aggravation this movie is everything bad that it could have possibly been. If you are somebody who likes animation but doesn't care about 1:Story 2:Character 3:Entertaining and pretty much anything else than this movie is for you. Overall this movie is bad and should have never been created.,Negative
163,Seriously this movie is one of my favourite movie of all time. go watch it,Negative
164,"I finally watched this solely because of the bad reviews and because it's on Netflix and I don't understand what's so bad about it.It wasn't a great movie, but really wasn't that bad. It had an actual plot, a decent enough script, and there was character growth. I'd rank it significantly higher than the 2024 animated disasters Despicable Me 4 and The Garfield Movie(both which were unwatchable). The Emoji Movie had its cringe moments, especially when out-of-touch Hollywood decided again to play 80s music for children, but overall was an okay movie.My main issue is that they targetted the wrong audience. Children aren't really texting, and there would've just been more opportunity if they had made this an adult cartoon. Emojis are used a lot on dating apps and texting apps, but not so much on Spotify and Just Dance.",Negative
165,"""The Emoji Movie"" is Hollywood's next attempt to make anything a ""thing."" The Emoji movie is about a meh emoji who may have a malfunction and some other stuff happens along the way. I don't really know. And I don't really care.The thing with animated movies is that you have to make them appealing to both kids and adults. This was neither. Adults will be bored with it, but at least kids will have fun right? Wrong. When the kid next to me is asleep a half hour into the movie and the girl in front of me leans over to her mother and asks ""Mom is the movie over yet,"" that is a problem within itself. There are so many bad attempts at humor in this film. The ""poop emoji"" is there for the poop jokes and there are other characters that have bad puns. Apparently this is what quailifies as humor now. It wasn't funny. I didn't laugh once throughout the entirety of the runtime. And the second half of this film is just a music video. Song after song plays, you see emojis dancing, and the movie stops taking itself seriously. Not like it ever did in the first place anyways. I just never thought a movie would be dumb enough to make it self a music video again after Suicide Squad did that.This movie loses your interest almost immediately. Movies like this have to be fun, entertaining, and interesting. There were so many scenes in this film where I was drifting off thinking about my next day's activities.This is worse than Transformers 5. Sadly almost as bad as Fifty Shades Darker.I am going to give ""The Emoji Movie"" a fat F, which is equivalent to the Poop emoji.Check out my review here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXA2cj6_bnw&t=1s",Negative
166,What the actual hell. This is only gonna be targeted for younger audience. This is the worst movie of all time. No joking. Cringe. Cringe. Cringe. I don't care what anyone thinks. This movie is as bad as drinking while driving.,Negative
167,"Wow, just from seeing the trailers of this ""thing"", I instantly want to vomit. IMDb should really allow 0 star and negative star ratings so I can go lower than a 1. Honestly Sony, what were you thinking when choosing this over the Popeye movie? We all knew this film would be a failure, if you look on Rotten Tomatoes you see it has FREAKING 0%! And I also think this is the reason why North Korea wants to nuke all of America, and I don't blame them. This movie made me lose all my faith in humanity. Whatever you do, DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP. You could be doing much better things with your life than paying to go see this pile of crap. And not to mention this is a rip off of Inside Out.",Negative

It all goes nowhere yet is still totally predictable. What is this garbage!?
It's not even bad in a good way i.e you can laugh at how bad it is. It's a zero effort cash grab that proves holleywood can spit in our faces, laugh, take our money and suffer zero consiquence.

I will excuse them if the movies at that time were very bad and they were waiting for something great or if they were very great and they were disappointed in it, although it is not something you expect a lot for.

The Hotel Transylvania short was 100% better than the movie itself.",Negative
178,"When it was first announced, I thought that the emoji movie was just some elaborate April fools prank. Clearly, I was wrong. This film was a steaming pile of human waste. It was a pandering, cliché mess of a movie that makes ""The Room"" look like a masterpiece. To be frank, I only watched the emoji movie because I was expecting it to be so bad that it was actually comical. Unfortunately, this movie's horrific nature is due to the immense blandness of the plot, the characters, the visuals. The plot is full of clichés, as are the characters. Each character is one dimensional and lacks nuance. Even the main character, Gene, is made to be a nuanced character who breaks the mold. However, he ends up being a one dimensional rest like everyone else. The visuals are uninspired. Every frame is full of colors, but frankly, the vibrancy just makes everything look like a can of children's medicines. Now would be an appropriate time to to make an analogy: Assume the Emoji Movie is a blank canvas, it is basic, pandering and cliché. Assume the Room is a child's drawing. A child's drawing, although inherently bad, is still more valuable than a blank canvas. The former is personal and is something that the child worked hard to make. The latter can be bought at a store and was built by a machine. In essence, the Emoji movie was made by a machine, made in a formulaic way. It lacks emotion, subtlety, or nuance. If you have a few hours on your hands, don't watch this film, watch something that was made by an artist, or even a generic human. Or even something made by yourself.",Negative
179,"The crappy trailers sum of this garbage piece of crap movie, Don't watch it, Don't Waste your hard earned money! The freaking BOSS BABY was more entertaining than this garbage!

Absolute Cancer...",Negative
180,"While the idea of an emoji movie is pretty silly, the introduction with the introduction of the characters is still interesting. Associating a lot of images with something that is nothing more than a series of jokes requires a certain intelligence and ingenuity. A emoji with greater capacity than the rest must face the challenge of discovering himself while joining other emojis that have certain interests. Finally, an evil corporation that directs the destiny of emojis is challenged to put control of the situation lest something finally get out of control. There are references to multiple applications and programs which would charm someone born in this century. There are a couple of great moments (dancing is one of them) and the movie, whether the perfectionists like it or not, isn't that bad.",Negative
181,Guys do not follow the other reviewer just watch your self the movie and decide it. I watched it today and well it was worth watching if I may told you that it was like a Wreck It Ralph movie the difference is that Wreck movie based on the inner world of games and these emoji movie it was based on Chatting Apps where we find ourselves many characters to send to communicate with others without wasting on writing. well this is all I have to say.don't ignore it watch and enjoy. Thanks guys,Negative

184,"Most people would be surprised to learn how much more there is to the emoji phenomenon than little digital icons which we use to express emotion or represent activities or locations in our text messages. For instance, did you know that the word emoji has nothing to do with the words emotion or emoticon? Emoji is a combination of the Japanese words for ""picture"" and ""character"". Emojis started appearing on Japanese cell phones in the late 1990s. When they began showing up in the U.S. on the Apple iPhone in 2011, soon followed by other smart phones, emojis truly became a global phenomenon. So much so that there's even an annual World Emoji Day – and an international organization which regulates emojis!July 17th is World Emoji Day because that's the date the calendar emoji shows, but every day is emoji day for the non-profit Unicode Consortium. According to a July 16, 2017 ""USA Today"" article, ""The Unicode Emoji Subcommittee determines which characters will become part of the official emoji lexicon, creating a uniform code that can be used across platforms."" The article also says that the consortium, which has been around since 1988, is striving to be more inclusive and representative when it comes to race, gender and sexual orientation, pointing out that, at press time, there were 2,666 approved emojis.Of course, the business and regulatory aspects of emojis don't matter to the people who send the 6 billion emoji-enhanced text messages worldwide every single day. They're just looking for a more complete way to express themselves digitally, to add a little emotional context to their messages. More than just being ""cute"", emojis help us communicate more effectively in our increasingly digital world. And with emojis increasingly prevalent in our daily text messages and Emails, is it any wonder that they would make their way onto movie screens too? And we get just that with the animated adventure comedy ""The Emoji Movie"" (PG, 1:26) bringing to ""life"" those little yellow faces and other digitized objects in the summer of 2017, less than two weeks after the 4th (yes, 4th) annual World Emoji Day.Alex (voiced by Jake T. Austin from the Disney Channel's ""Wizards of Waverly Place"") is a typical teenager. He doesn't like school, but he does like a girl in his school, a pretty young lady named Addie (Tati Gabrielle). Of course, he tries to communicate with her through his smart phone, but he finds it difficult – because he's shy, but also because his phone seems to have a mind of its own these days. Little does Alex know, but inside his phone is a virtual city called Textopolis, which is where emojis live and work. The job of all the emojis is to stand by for Alex to call upon them in a text message and, when chosen, to present their best individual image as he or she is scanned for a digital text transmission.Gene (T.J. Miller) is excited and nervous because this is his first day on the job as an emoji – the ""meh"" emoji. His parents, Mr. & Mrs. Meh (Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge), aren't sure he's ready, but he assures them that he is and he takes his position in his cube, waiting to be chosen to appear in a text message. When Alex chooses the meh emoji for a text to Addie, Gene freaks out during his scan, causing Alex to embarrass himself by sending Addie a very odd-looking emoji that she doesn't understand. Gene's mistake causes Smiler (Maya Rudolph), the head emoji, to label Gene a ""malfunction"" and order that he be deleted. Gene makes a run for it and Smiler sends menacing black bots after him.Gene's ""problem"" is that he feels and expresses more emotions than meh. Now, besides being frustrated that he can't just be the meh that he was born to be, he has endangered the entire emoji community. If Alex thinks there's something wrong with his phone, he may just have it wiped clean. Hoping to get ""fixed"", Gene teams up with the hand emoji Hi-5 (James Corden), who is upset that he's no longer in the Favorites Lounge, and the two of them go in search of a hacker named Jailbreak (Anna Faris). Jailbreak is uninterested in helping them until she sees that Gene can show multiple emotions. She decides to help them get to a magical place called The Cloud where all of them may find the solutions to their problems. As the three emojis work their way through Alex's phone (while trying to steer clear of the bots), they cause various apps to malfunction, making even more problems for Alex.""The Emoji Movie"" is derivative and not very enjoyable. The story, directed and co-written by Tony Leondis (""Lilo & Stitch: Stitch Has a Glitch"") is a combination of ""Inside Out"", ""Toy Story"", ""Divergent"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"", but not nearly as good as any of them. The script finds many opportunities for humor in actual cell phone usage and the emojis that ""live"" in them, but the movie just isn't all that funny. There are positive lessons about the bonds of friendship and being the best version of yourself regardless of what others think, but those ideas have been portrayed more effectively by countless other movies before this one. ""The Emoji Movie"" is clever enough, but entertaining? Not enough. ""C""",Negative
185,"Sony, stick to phones and video games. I can't help but feel like this is to sabotage Apple with a terrible movie. Sony made 3 good movies. Spider Man 1 and 2, and Spider Man homecoming. This one is the worst one. Even illumination animation is better, because though the don't make the best movies, you can somewhat know what they are just by looking at them. Sony's single digit IQ doesn't allow them to do this, so make a movie, where the characters are emotions. At least inside out does things to make them more complex than ""He's happy, make him a happy emoji."" Even Foodfight, the terrible movie, has characters creative ideas. No animated movie is worse than this, and this definitely made Steve Jobs roll over in his grave. Don't see this movie, unless you get to see it for free.",Negative

189,"Ok people are gonna not like me for this, but I kinda like this movie. The movie is not like the worst thing ever compare to other terrible movies like Norm Of The North or Where The Dead Go To Die. A 3.3 isn't really the rating this movie deserves.",Negative

Yes the animation is ""emoji"" (average) style but then again it kind of adds to the feeling of the movie. 
Pros - short and fast paced (not a minute dragged), quite original concept of the ""phone world"", has the expected friends&family values you expect from a teenage oriented movie, AND you'll have a constant smile on your face.
Cons - may be a bit predictable (yet not boring), some parts sound like a commercial indeed and aimed at teenagers (pro or con, depending on your age).

This movie is a piece of trash and deserves every single piece of criticism coming its way. This movie is a huge disgrace to what animation stands for.

Yeah, the plots is a bit predictable and borrows heavily from other kids CGI movies like Wreck it Ralph and other kids fare. It has its moments and had me chuckling from time to time with its somewhat dry humor which is my kind of humor. All the product placement didn't bother me (which is what I think a lot of people really don't like) but I'm fine with it since it tends to bring us closer with the real world.

With the Emoji Movie, there's nothing enjoyable about this, all it shows is that it's ripped from films like Wreck-It-Ralph, Inside Out, The Smurfs, The Lego Movie, etc.All the amount of product placement in this is amazing.Its incredible of how much that I didn't laugh once during this movie. The jokes are shocking, the characters are either bland or mean-spirited, the animation is so poor, the voice work is sluggish and dull, the character designs are lazy, the story and its sub-plots are lazily stolen from other movies, and worst of all... they sacrificed so many good movie ideas to make this shameless money-grabbing ploy.I do not recommend this movie at all, your kids deserve better than a movie like this, even if you rent it, its not worth wasting your money, I wouldn't even take it if it was free. Kids deserve better than this trash...I wanted to give it a lower score, but sadly it only goes down to ""one"", but trust me, it deserves a much lower score...",Negative
203,"You know a movie's horrible if viewing it makes you re-evaluate your life. I was tempted to run a psychological evaluation immediately after deciding to watch. Normally when you take a bathroom break you would want to go back as soon as possible. This was NOT the case. In fact, you'd gladly take as much time as possible away from the theater just to escape the soul-crushing horror that is the Emoji Movie.The audio and visuals that this film emits radiates worse than than that of the 1986 Chernobyl Disaster. Long-lasting side effects include mental breakdowns, night terrors and clinical depression. Overall, this ""movie"" is not for the faint of heart. Watch with caution.",Negative

But since this movie was so bad, so terrible, so fundamentally flawed that it offended me to the very core of my soul and has left an irremovable blotch upon it, I felt obligated to give this movie the worse possible rating I could on the first movie-rating website that I could find. I awoke this morning, screaming (from nightmares), frantic to help the cause in making this ""movie"" the most infamous in all the four corners of the omniverse, due to the great injustice to the sense that this abomination has scarred me with.

206,"After I finished streaming the emoji movie on Netflix yesterday, I guess It's not bad, nor good. I don't know why people criticize the movie before it is even released in theatersd I seen people in the comments say that they are not gonna watch it because it is going to be ""cringey"" or ""bad"" or ""that no one would want to watch it but young kids who actually want to see the movie."" etc etc. I had to agree with everyone else here because of their non constructive criticism. At school everyone was talking about how trash it is and stuff. Well, that is what 2 of my friends say anyways. And for the whole school days we sometimes talk about why the movie is garbage and how the characters too atrocious (referring to the 3rd Dimensional smileys with arms and legs.) I said that I was gonna watch it after it's launch. and never did. For 3 years. Till in 2020, I thought that I was going to watch said movie title on Netflix. My sister has her subscription of Netflix for the both of us so it would be very easy to get ahold with the movie. So I actually watched it. At first I thought it was going to be worse just like the Internet thought but... In my opinion AGAIN, I don't love it... I don't hate it either... It's just In... The middle. Ok done.",Negative

It's hard to imagine a movie this bad coming out at this point of time. I can see how this would be OK if a group of college students made it, but this is by Sony Pictures. I hold those guys to higher standards and they failed us. They failed us so bad, they should refund me my money.",Negative
208,The emoji movie is amazing but you're all just bullies. It teaches children love and compassion and that you can be a princess and a rebel at the same time. This movie should go on to make 26842651 sequels because this is what the children of this world need. #emojimovieforever,Negative
209,"I don't understand why the score is so low. Yes, it's not the movie of the century and yes there's advertising in it but the animation is good and the main character is likable. The plot is pretty straight forward, in the emoji world every emoji have to keep his one face on at all times but one emoji just can do it and he goes on a quest to fix himself so he can be like everybody else.
I think it is mostly for kids but I don't see a reason why the whole family couldn't watch it together.
I guess, if you're looking for something extraordinary or super clever, then it's probably not for you but if you just want to watch a fun animated movie with your kids, there's no reason not to enjoy it.",Negative
210,"I was forced to watch it with my siblings and I hated every minute of it, I came out of the cinema just to realize that I wasted 1hr 30 minutes of my life watching this garbage.It is one of the most unoriginal movies I have ever seen in my entire life, its setting and theme are literally derived from films like Wreck-It Ralph, Inside Out and The Lego Movie.I mean Jailbreak, is literally a copy-paste of Lucy from the lego movie, and Gene is derived from Ralph in Wreck-It Ralph and Emmet from the Lego Movie, and HI-5 who is meant to be funny sidekick is more obnoxious than funny, I mean come on, his jokes are literally the most unfunniest anyone would ever think of, even children would not laugh at.Even the animation is the laziest I have seen especially considering that this was released in 2017, I mean Pixar films of the 1990s (Toy Story, A Bug's Life & Toy Story 2) were better animated than this piece of trash.One last thing, I still do not understand how can a loving God give people such a horrendous idea for a film and the ability to even make and release it.Please, for the love of all that is holy, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM, I literally lost 10% of my braincells this watching and wasted 1hr 30min of my life and even questioned the existence of God after realising that he would let a film this bad go into theaters.",Negative

212,"This movie was as expected. Bad. If done differently, they had a chance of making this an enjoyable movie. But they only made this for money. So they didn't care weather it was good or not.

It keeps a good pace. It held the attention of my four year old for the entire length and that alone makes it worth it.",Negative
216,"Let's get this out of the way: The Emoji Movie is by no means a good movie. In many ways, it suffers from the same problem as the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels. The graphics are beautiful, and the voice acting is spectacular. The music isn't the best, but it's still decent. They got great animators, actors, and composers to make this movie. So why was it so bad? In a word, the writers. I don't know what the people who scripted this thing were thinking. The plot is just so terrible, there are no words. The main issue with the plot is how utterly cliche it is. If you think about it, this movie is basically the Lego Movie, but with all the minifigures replaced by emojis. The Lego movie really was a good movie, but this movie stole it's plot, removed all the exciting scenes, severely diluted the antagonist, and basically turned it into garbage.Occasionally, the movie will throw in a good joke. Some of them are actually pretty funny and witty. That's the main upside. If nothing else, it will occasionally make you laugh.But all of that aside, as a hardcore fan of Michael Jackson, there is one element of this movie that I do find offensive: Hi-Five claiming he can dance as good as ""Michael"" and putting on a Smooth Criminal Style fedora, then immediately proceeding to dance terribly. As a fan of Michael Jackson, I hate this scene for that one reason.",Negative

223,"Contrary to many unbelievable online reviews, this movie is quite trash. If, in the future, the human race were to look back at our past achievements and judge whether or not we were on the right track, they'd most likely assume we were in the dark ages again, only this time with emojis.
This movie has no merit, no redeeming qualities and no enjoyment to be had while watching it. This 90 minute endurance test serves only as product placement and an advertisement. If you went to the theatre to watch this movie, you'd probably have a hard time telling the difference between the pre-movie ads and the movie itself. That would also mean that you paid for that experience, and for that you have my sympathy. 
They actually somehow got Sir Patrick Stewart to voice a role in this movie, and his character was, quite literally, poop. Delivering some of the laziest poop jokes that Hollywood has ever written, I guess even Picard needs the money. This movie is absolute trash, not even worthy of being taken into a tip or a landfill, just atomically disassemble the entire thing and launch it into space where some alien colony will find it and eradicate it with lasers. 
The Emoji Movie made 217.8 Million dollars at the box office with a budget of 50 million dollars. Economists suspect that this movie will serve as a catalyst for another worldwide economic crash, and I for one welcome it.
This movie actually won awards and were nominated for some others, some of which were more deserving. It won worst picture, worst director, worst screen combo and worst screenplay. It was also nominated for the Black Reel Awards, Movieguide Awards and Kids' Choice Awards, for whatever value that's worth. 
I don't think I can actually get away with simply saying that this movie is bad, everyone knows it. You know it, I know it, the people that made this movie know it and even the people that were paid to give these movies good reviews especially know it. Things need to change. We need to riot. We need to start a new Hollywood revolution. Anyone that is listening needs to heed my call. We need to tell people that we will not stand for this anymore. WE. WANT. FREEDOM.",Negative
224,"Everyone keeps saying this movie is terrible but it's not that bad. Certainly it is not the 41st worst movie ever...I think anyone will admit that it's not exactly polished; a lot of the jokes are too in-your-face, there's an over abundance of puns and a lot of the dialogue is heavy and awkward but that doesn't mean it isn't fun.The inspiration apparently came from toy story and continues a tradition of compiling real pop culture references that we saw in Roger Rabbit, Food Fight and Wreck It Ralph though the movies actual narrative seems most indebted to the Lego movie with its themes of conformism and creativity of expression.I like the message even if it is kind of ham fisted, both our protagonist Gene and the female lead Jailbreak are likeable even if JailBreak is blatantly just Wyldestyle from the Lego Movie and James Cordon's High comic relief as High Five is maybe kind of annoying but that's more due to lame jokes than any intrinsic problem. I found the antagonist actually pretty creepy, as are all perpetually happy people.Ultimately I came away feeling warmly about the movie for it's rich, distinctive world, positive message and how it embodies an aspect of its time while tying it to a universal them even if it's not exactly subtle about it.",Negative
225,"Honestly, this movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. The whole idea is creative and could've been such an amazing movie but it was lacking a lot of things, like the plot and dialogue. The visuals, characters and setting was terrific. It was visually appealing and all the apps and emojis were very imaginative and well done, but the dialogue was cringe and the plot was confusing. A lot of it didn't make sense, and the good parts of the movie sadly don't make up for the bad. I don't think this is a suitable movie for young kids as it involves social media and a lot of other things that only teens would understand but it is a pretty lame movie for older kids and adults. Don't waste your time and money on it!",Negative
226,"If you want to see an amazing crime-drama, ""The Emoji Movie"" is for you. It contains a dazzling story, a insanely beautiful musical score, and well developed characters.

I would show it to my kids if I had some.",Negative
227,"0.5/4...And yes I saw it...well, kind of. Half of it at least. This could very well be the worst movie of 2017. It is a movie that only exists due to being in a state of obvious parody. It possesses no merit of its own, it's highly chichéd, and it lacks any kind of originality.The flaws of this movie are so incredibly abundant, that it would take forever to jot them all down. Among the first that come to mind: the bad apple is obvious from the start. It feels political (just look at the emojis confirmed to their communist-like society). There is no emotional connection to any character whatsoever...only whimsical spikes of interest here and there. The script is bland and at times cringy. There is no emotional connection BETWEEN the characters (this is a problem because emojis represent...ah-hem...emotions) and to top it off, it feels second-hand in a very sour way.This movie is a BOMB as far as quality, but I think a 0.5/4 will suffice due to the fun I had laughing at it. It really makes you wonder how stinkers like this makes it past the drawing board.",Negative

The humor is about as entertaining as watching cement dry,the characters are 1 dimensional and annoying,and the plot is from the STONE AGE.The target audience is kids such as myself but I don't see how even the youngest of the young could enjoy this potty/gross out humor infested rat nest. Not worth anything,let alone your money. Go buy a Pixar film and have actual JOY in watching it.",Negative
229,"the emoji movie is a piece of poop emoji. i do not like. i went to take my children the amount of time they said the word poop surprised me. i have young children, and they cannot be hearing this type of poop. the amount of poop jokes is off the charts. one time, they even say, ""we're number 2!"" instead of number 1. this absolutely disgusts me. do not watch this if your want to keep your children from doing drugs, smoking, and browsing the Internet. this movie turns innocent children into homosexuals. how dare you, Sony! i am a single mother of 4, and have a very high belief of Jesus. this movie goes against all of my and my children's beliefs. please understand that this movie is not for anyone except for adults and should be rated AC for adult content.

I will never emotionally recover, nothing about this movie is good an any one, I watched (part) of this nightmare so you don't have to.

237,"This movie provides no hope for a bright future and is a disaster to humanity.There is absolutely no creativity and the lack of purpose and passion in life is prominent through the plot line and the characters. Producers have clearly become so dreadfully boring that they had to capture the joy and excitement of communication through technology, and turn it into a complete disappointment.The characters are completely unrealistic and have no real humour or personality. If you want to produce a movie based on emoji's every day lives, at least make it a little interesting, a movie is to be enjoyed, not to be dreaded. The main character Gene, is frankly pathetic! What do you mean he can't pull a 'meh' facial expression, that's why he exists? And that's his parent's function too. Also the main antagonist?! Explain to me, WHY is she a 'smiley face' emoji but the villain? This completely changes humanities perspective, how are we expected to go on and use this emoji when this awful movie has shaped the smiley face as a negative image? I will never use it again. No one should honour this disgrace of filmography.My friend recommended this to me and whilst I displayed my hatred, he told me to trust the process... But I will never trust him again.This movie is an utter nightmare, I may need to dispose of all technology after this chaotic kerfuffle! When I sleep, emoji shaped demons form in my head due to the nonsense I have witnessed!I would not recommend this shallow and meaningless movie to anyone, not even innocent children. Absolutely nobody would find this exciting.This movie was a reality check for me, I know now to research beforehand and know my self-worth before watching mere junk. Please do not waste time on this piece of rubbish.This movie is not art, but it is a lifeless void.If this movie were to be wiped off the face of the earth... I concur!",Negative
238,"The universal panning of The Emoji Movie (2017) is not deserved nor is it the worst movie of the year. It is easy to dismiss an animated film that satirises how humans communicate. However, it does raise serious issues; so if you are not interested in hearing a defence of the film, stop reading now.There are a number of levels at which The Emoji Movie can be read. If you expect conventional narrative logic, characterisation, emotional impact, clever script or technical originality, you will inevitably be disappointed. But if you are looking for an imaginative take on today's mass communication culture, it is an interesting film. The animated story unfolds inside the nano-world of a smartphone, amongst the apps populated by emoji. We see 'life' from the viewpoint of Gene who, on his first day in the emoji directory, is deemed dysfunctional because he shows more expression than allowed by his single-dimension 'meh' persona. When the phone-owning teenager selects Gene to send to his girlfriend it causes communication chaos in both human and smartphone worlds. Gene becomes a doomed emoji and must flee Textopolis in search of reprogramming, passing through firewalls and big-name apps like Instagram, Spotify and Twitter. He teams up with another obsolete emoji called Hi 5 and a love interest named Jailbreak, all with deadly bots in hot pursuit while the trio flee for safety in the Cloud. Doomsday approaches when the teenager decides to wipe his phone.OK, OK; you were warned that it is not a conventional film. So, what's the point? One clue is the classroom teacher who explains to cell phone-dependent students that human communication was first recorded using ancient hieroglyphics, a pictographic language similar to an emoji directory. Despite the evolution of written communication over millennia, the use of single-meaning pictographic symbols has exploded. Is this the way of the future? While the film does not answer this question, it does offer an imaginative look into the world of smartphone communication. There is a social class system that groups emoji into favourites, ordinary, and rarely used, and the favourites rule the world with popular one-dimensional messages. Ambivalent or unpopular emoji are publicly persecuted and the trash is the ghetto of the unwanted. The Smiley emoji was the first ever made and it now exerts totalitarian control through a smile that appears happy but can also mask sinister intent. Gender politics rules the emoji and tomboy Jailbreak is really a princess in disguise who is desperately trying to avoid being treated like a girl. In other words, the emoji domain is a perfect mirror of the human world.Nobody is arguing that this is a great film, but it is not a disaster. Decades from now it will be dug up and studied as a whimsical cultural artefact that portrays the imagined relationship between humanity and digital communication. Researchers will ask why hieroglyphics returned as a universal language and why humans came to rely on homogenised icons to convey meaning. If a movie can change the way you see things then it is worthwhile. This writer will never look at emoji in the same way again.",Negative
239,"This movie had everything wrong. The story was awful, the characters were awful, and the concept completely is stupid. The movie shouldn't exist and the film felt like it led to nowhere. The ending was also unsatisfying. The jokes were corny and the character development leads to nowhere. This film is a monstrosity and can possibly be considered as the worst film in cinema history. The story was very unoriginal and the main villain had literally zero good motives become a villain in the first place. The plot-twist was awful as it led to nowhere. And there were some characters I wish I never met in my life.",Negative
240,"We enjoyed watching this with the kids. My kids do love this movie and just keep watching it again and again. I'm shocked to learn it has so many awful reviews.
I cannot tell how good or bad the director of the movie is. But as a regular viewer who has small kids I can say it is quite entertaining and has some good things for little kids to learn, e.g. the main character, Gene, never leaves his friends behind and treats other members of his little emoji world with kindness no matter where they are in their social hierarchy. There are some interesting parallels with the real world as well: Gene has to be ""meh"" just like his parents who are ""real pros"". But instead he has a special ability to express many feelings at once which is treated as a ""malfunction"". One real story I can recall was about a kid who was incredibly talented dancer but could not focus in class and was nearly diagnosed with ADHD. We force kids and people in general into some sort of boxes and if they don't fit we consider it a disorder, a ""malfunction"", something that is not cool and should be fixed. This animation movie teaches little kids to be themselves and freely express themselves. Old idea but good nonetheless. This is great.
Whoever left extremely low ratings are probably sad people who cannot see anything good in life. Maybe the storyline wasn't great and the director wasn't good but there are good things about this anination and you cannot seriously be that displeased with just about everything.",Negative

244,"The Emoji Movie 3 out of 10.
On all levels, it is a derivative of Wreck it Ralph and similar movies, replicating its premise, characters and themes, but executed without any nuance, design, substance or purpose. Where Wreck it Ralph is built on easy nostalgia-bait, the Emoji Movie seems to be a series of advertisements and product placements for Just Dance, Candy Crush and other apps. The Emoji Movie goes so far as to copy the twist regarding the female lead.The viewing experience is tiring as the comedy the movie strings its plot points together with is either knowingly lazy, or arrogantly naive. Humour in this movie is supposedly evident when high five throws up candy, monkeys say they are off to do ""monkey business"", or when Sir Patrick Stewart, the poop emoji says the words ""stink"", ""duty"", and -
Emoji 1: ""Poop, youre so soft""
Sir Patrick Stewart as the poop emoji: ""Not too soft I hope""The animation was basic, but not poor and distracting, so I guess that makes it boring. The world of 'Textopolis' and the phone was very basic and bare, even with all the bright colours on the screen. The music in this movie is played very obnoxiously, with half relevant dance songs such as, wake me up before you go-go, feel this moment and cheerleader to name a few. The icing on the cake to this movie is when it ends on an impromptu dance party, where everyone comes to accept the main character instantly, kinda like, but worse than, Despicable Me, Megamind and The LEGO Movie.
The relationships between the main three characters, the high five, the meh and jailbreak was more like 3 people hanging around each other, going to the same place, than high five and meh being friends and jailbreak any sort of love interest.
The slang made to relate to kids was also outdated by the time this movie came out. Having James Corden say shade, #blessed, lit and slay was really forced and unnecessary. I would also rather leave out the references in this movie that do not appeal to kids and are not enough to appeal to adults. The poop emoji pretending to be in star trek, the culture of internet trolls and the Trojan horse virus.
Kids deserve better than a cheap 86 minute distraction - see The Lego Movie or Wreck it Ralph instead, which both executed an 'it's okay to be yourself/different' story on a far greater level.",Negative

250,"I don't know where to start with this, except that 2017 The Emoji Movie by Sony pictures is probably one of the most beautiful, inspirational movies of its time. The animation is so fantastic, so clean and so fluid it surpasses any Pixar movie. The plot and story is written marvelously, the express and work gone into this movie is amazing. There is so much emotion that it brought tears to my eyes. I have never in my life watched a movie, so perfect. There is no other movie that can challenge it.",Negative
251,"This wasn't the best kids movie I've ever seen but it was entertaining and funny for the kids and adults alike. I've given it 6 stars, would've been 6.5 but IMDB doesn't go halves. Worth a watch if you need something easy :)",Negative
252,"The IMDb user review guidelines suggests the use of English in expressing one own's thoughts and sentiments regarding the films/movies they have just seen is very much preferred in the reviews, although I've encountered some instances where people have kind of reverted back to speaking (or writing) in what is perhaps their own language, encountering phrases other than English every now and then is really no biggie. But now I have started to see that the cute innovation in e-communication, those emojis, have already crept into some submitted user reviews now (and I would state that I'm guilty of dropping ASCII ideograms/emoticons in reviews;) so I have no complaints there, that made me actually quite glad, but I'm kind of bothered about that at the same time. I find those things cute and consider it useful in spicing up whatever thought I'm trying to express, or lines of emojis such as this:🍴🙏😍👍🎯🎥is kind of struggle in squeezing enough brain juice to assemble that. A different language altogether. Perhaps I'm already to just too old for head to rewire new neural connections to be just as quick on my feet as the kids nowadays when it comes to those things. Talk about generational gap. Or I better leave such things for emojilogists to decipher. But using such for adornment, I find it quite fun, which kind of made me think of a modest proposal that maybe the IMDb crowd might one day consider. Perhaps by alloting a separate space in their website, or one could call it a shrine a corner in the webpage where people can sort of attribute what emoji would most describe their experience in having watched the film/movie in a more playful and colorful manner to complement the existing numeric rating (which is useful in sorting, or in giving a perspective of how a film stacks up against other films/movie made), those smiley face, crying face or poop emoji (that is if that would not be regarded as an unaccepable) will kind of give audience a chance to express their feelings or warning people of what they could expect about the film/movie. But perhaps imposing a three-emoji maximum would do for such a thing, which will then be displayed in a part of a the webpage, or a separate page with the frequently used ones ending up bigger than the lesser-used emojis, the same way some websites highlight the frequently used keywords by presenting them in bigger or slightly bigger fonts than the other lesser used ones. And those people who have difficulty in filling up the 50-character minimum requirement for posting reviews could knock themselves out in such a space, a place that will perhaps give a glance of what would turn out to be like one of those mini-Bruegel painting made of different emojis.I am aware that the GetSatisafaction message site is the more appropriate place for leaving such suggestions, but mine is not really a pressing matter. I'm just rambling and just compensating for having not much good to say about this movie.For a film that professes a moral that one should embrace their multidimentionality instead of hiding it, which is always a good thing, they sure used the wrong subject to proclaim that. Even though what ends up becoming as a well-intentioned, satisfactory CG-animated movie that's overflowing with kawaii appeal, and gives one a snapshot of tech/cyber landscape nowadays that perhaps in a few years time reach its obselescence, and a public bathroom scene with Gene and his parents which I find quite hysterical (one-layered humor where one doesn't need to wear a thinking caps to process it), and the variety of outstanding voice talents asked to participate in the film that includes comedian Steven Wright, a spot-on on being cast as Gene Meh's dad, all of that really was not enough to really redeem this movie. And I know it's easy to pick on an criticize a Razzie-awarded flick, but I just have to agree with them on that, because using a story of a rogue emoji, programmed to do a certain task and does something else, really just makes the main protagonist look more like an aberration.My rating: 🦊-trot.",Negative
253,"I've noticed this movie is getting a lot of hate ratings, and I wonder how many of the people that have rated it 1 have actually seen the movie. I have seen some movies that are worth rating a 1 before, but The Emoji Movie isn't quite that bad. This was the perfect movie for my 11 year old son, as he LOVED It! I was mildly amused. The movie wasn't awful, and it wasn't great.The movie is about a ""meh"" emoticon that gets sent (by the user) while making a different face. Apparently, it is unheard of to make the wrong face, so that gets him into a lot of trouble. He befriends an emoticon that used to be popular, but is hardly ever used now, and they seek out a emoticon defector/hacker to help Gene (Meh), become the meh he thinks he is supposed to be. I felt the movie had a good message about being yourself, although the character's aren't given much depth in the film.If you are considering taking your kids to this because you want something to do, but are unsure because of your reviews, you could take a chance on it. If you are broke and don't go to the movies very often, however, wait for video or streaming. Overall, it is a light, cheesy watch if there isn't anything else to see with the kids.",Negative

256,an hour and a half boring fest is the emoji movie! I was so board of this disaster of a flick that I saw it in a drive in just wanting to see spider man homecoming which was up next! the story starts with gene the what the heck kind of an emoji he is narrating about their world inside a phone. I was surprised that the poop emoji wasn't a main character and I'm glad he wasn't. the jokes are god awful and the characters are terrible but the animation was cool. the boy who's phone the emoji lives in is a god awful character he is. the actor who plays him us someone who I wouldn't want to be in my movie. The emoji movie is the 1# most hates movie in the whole wide world and is recommended for little kids! TERRIBLE MOVIE!,Negative

It's an average children's animated movie which adults can also vaguely enjoy.",Negative
259,"This movie is a sad defecation on Sony Pictures. It is not just a sad defecation, it is a cashgrabbing dump on modern society. The Popeye Movie idea was cleverly put up, with great wordplay. But this... copypaste thing that copies Wreck-It Ralph and Lego Movie does not deserve to be reviewed, but I had to reluctantly do so. Gene is a meh emoji who does not have a filter, and he would make the wrong face. Gene = Emmet. One scene references Wreck-It Ralph. Hi-5 is the worst comic relief I've ever seen. Scrappy Doo? PFFT! What does he have against the Hi-5 Emoji? Jailbreak is Wyldstyle, and Smiley is Candy King or Lord Business. This film was so predictable and rotten, that it got a 1.4 on IMDb. This overtakes Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill as the 3rd worst movie in my Worst Movies List. On the plus side... The voice acting and animation is well done, but did they really have to make this bad?",Negative
260,"I seriously do not understand all of these reviews that are giving this movie such a low rating. I'm not a kid, nor do I have children of my own. I'm 36yrs old and usually don't watch animated films, but I love this movie!! This movie is truly great for all ages. As far as emojis go, they nailed it with how technology is today. This is one of those movies that just puts you in a positive fun mood every time you watch it.. If your looking for a movie that is fun and cute - then I highly recommend. Watch a scary movie and then double feature this afterwards so you have sweet dreams and its perfect. :-)",Negative
261,"""The Emoji Movie"" (2017) by Tony Leondis, while often criticized, holds a special place for many, including my daughters who genuinely enjoyed it! It's a vibrant, fast-paced adventure that brings the digital world to life with colorful animation and a positive message about embracing your true self, even if you're a ""meh"" emoji. The film's energy and simple humor resonated well, providing a fun and engaging experience for younger audiences. It's a lighthearted escape that proves entertainment can sometimes be found in the most unexpected places.",Negative
262,"I can't believe Sony cancelled one of the most classic cartoons of all time just for this, EMOJIS! Popeye is considered a classic among kids and adults alike, but no, instead we got a ripoff of Wreck-It Ralph, Lego Movie, and Inside Out combined, 3 superior movies; Wreck-It Ralph being my favorite. Unoriginal concept, and clichéd/annoying (not as annoying as the minions from the Despicable Me series) characters sums up the movie's rating/reviews. If you want to find a better movie, I recommend either the 3 movies I've mentioned or the new 2017 releases. Otherwise, do not take anyone here or ask them to go to this movie!",Negative
263,"this movie doesn't count as a movie, it's an Advertisement its advertised garbage meant to sell products. anybody working on this movie besides the animation team that made this not only look good but also interesting and doesn't give off a cheap vibe like the boss baby. all the jokes and dialogue was uninteresting and forced and was most likely written by executives in an hour with there out of touch delusions of what a teenager, in fact, treating them as a demographic, not people. the voice acting was dull and uninteresting. the cast was brought in to get names on the IMDb page the acting is passable at best but what annoys me is how many traits were stolen from CGI kids movies from the past 5 years ranging from wreck it Ralph to the Lego movie but two things these movies did better than the emoji movie is integrity and understanding of their audience a great example is the Lego movie, the movie's substance was studied heavily down to the movement of the characters and the movie could stand on its own as a refreshing, creative and entertaining movie. there was so much more I could have talked about but I'm going to leave this review but I'm going to leave this review with a score of 100 dead writers that wrote this movie. this movie doesn't deserve a real score.",Negative

265,Please do not make the mistake of watching this movie. Odds are the creators think the target crowd is either small children or people who like movies who are 'so bad they're good' which means the movie is probably made 💩 on purpose so people will watch it due to curiosity (And masochism),Negative
266,"After seeing 'The Emoji Movie' I can effectively say that our veterans have it easy when it comes to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and yes that is a joke. If you think that joke is bad then you'd be right in thinking that I have about as much talent as everyone that worked on this movie. If your child comes and asks you to see this movie don't panic, just follow these simple steps: 1. Retrieve your shotgun 2. Put your child down. There's nothing else that can be done for them. I'm not going to write a real in depth review because this movie does not deserve it, so I'll just paste my notes here: The Good: nothing. Im serious, nothing is good in this movie. Some things are average or done somewhat-competently, like the overall animation, but nothing is actually above average or good.The Bad:-It's soulless -Has no pacing -Has no character development but still tries to force some anyways-Hates millennials, thinks we are dumb and self centered and callous. It also stereotypes us while preaching about not stereotyping women-literally forces feminism into the plot worse than any other film I have ever seen and tries to make princess emojis seem anti-women ""I don't need a man to save me""a character says #truth literally beats you over the f*cking head about any and everything the boy wins the girl in the end by sending an emoji. This is not a joke or over simplification. This movie literally thinks we communicate solely through emojis -dialogue breaks down into 4 very obvious categories: 1. Sh*tty jokes 2. Forced social commentary 3. Forced and obvious character development 4. Forced and obvious statements meant to move the plot forward it plays the joke about the 'meh emojis saying emotional dialogue without emotions' throughout the whole f*cking film there is seriously no pacing in this film. Scenes just randomly end and go to other scenes for no rhyme or reason. This film basically has the bare minimum when it comes to plot, characters, and jokes This movie was made just for product placement and nothing else-THE BOY LITERALLY WRITES THE LYRICS TO ""shine bright like a diamond"" AS A LOVE NOTE CAUSE DON'T F*CKING FORGET US MILLENNIALS ARE ACTUALLY MENTALLY IMPAIRED they go into Spotify just to plug in certain songs into the f*cking movie. There's absolutely no reason it needed to be in the movie other than that btw guess what the hacker is actually the princess WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED? ITS LITERALLY THE PLOT TO WRECK-IT-RALPH I actually empathized with the villain. Not because I was supposed to, cause you're not, but because the other characters are just so awful. The villain was almost kind of funny at moments, and in truth killing our main emoji dude would have been the only way to save the phone world. Overall she has more of a purpose and more defined goals than any other character in this film. also can we talk about the mid-credits scene. Cause yeah I was so disturbed by what I had seen that I couldn't move from my chair so I sat there until this scene rolled up wait first let me say that Anna Faris or whatever her name is might be the worst voice actress I've ever heard. And by might be, I mean it's not even close OK so the end credits scene directly contradicts the end of the movie. The movie ending has all the characters being accepted into the COOL EMOJIS CLUB I HONESTLY WISH I WAS MAKING THIS SH*T UP. But in the credits scene we see a bunch of the lame emojis and the evil smiley lady in the basement for loser emojis. Like the emoji movie even failed at its message that everyone should be liked/equal or some corny sh*t like that.FINAL MESSAGE: this movie makes the angry birds movie look like a masterpiece. If this movie came out during the cold war, the USSR would show it to its civilians as anti-American propaganda to show how stupid and consumer obsessed we are. If an alien race was to decide the fate of this planet based solely on watching this film, they would no doubt decide to exterminate humanity.",Negative
267,"Ever since The Lego Movie was made, I've taken it upon myself to be open to more ideas that sound like cash grabs, but could also be more. The Lego Movie sounded like a giant commercial for the toy company. Instead, it was smart tribute to the creativity it inspires and was very funny. That has made me realize that out of everything, storytelling can allow anything to be engaging if people can emotionally connect with it enough. If people could find that connection with a bunch of toys and bricks, whose to say that the same thing could be found with emojis?Most people with smartphones have used an emoji at some point. I myself like the ones that either engage laughter or show off that I'm trying to convey something smooth. While I have no problem using it every once and a while, I dislike it when it becomes the prominent way of communication. I haven't asked any teenagers about that, but I'm sure that most of them still need text to order specific food or to tell their parents that their out until midnight. I like the think that all teens are smart, but The Emoji Movie makes them an unsalable group. In the smartphone of high schooler Alex (played by Jake T. Austin), is where all the emojis live where they live and work a part of the texting app. Meh emojis Mel (played by Steven Wright) and Mary (played by Jennifer Coolidge) are about their see their son Gene (played by T.J. Miller) go off to be used in his first text. Gene seems to have the ability to show other expressions and that happens when his text goes wrong. The leader of the emojis Smiler (played by Maya Rudolph) talks with other emojis like the Devil Emoji (played by Sean Hayes), dancer emoji (played by Sofia Vergara) and Poop emoji (played by Patrick Stewart) about what to do.When Gene gets word that he is likely to be deleted, he escapes with the hand emoji, HI-5 (played by James Cordon). Upon leaving the texting app, he finds a jailbreak emoji (played by Anna Faris) who tells him that if they can get to the Icloud, then his source code can be fixed. From there, they go through several apps including Candy Crush, Instagram, Just Dance, and more while everybody learns about being themselves...or something like that.Sony pictures should be ashamed. The Emoji Movie has to be one of the most obvious product plug movies ever made. I thought The Internship (the movie about Google) was bad, but this sets a new record. Not only do the story rip off Wreck it Ralph, Inside Out and The Lego Movie, but several times, the plot just stops to make another advertisement. If anything, I felt like I just sat through an introduction for a cult; a cult that clearly does not understand how teenagers, computers, programs, apps, games, and emotional storytelling work. Even for it's obnoxious tie ins, how are the characters? As hard as the majority of these actors try, this script does everything to suck out anything funny or interesting. This is more then a bad movie; this is a black mark on a resume that is likely to hurt every single person involved. I cannot remember anytime that I laughed, nor even heard a chuckle from the kids in my theater. I can only imagine that the parents that took their kids to this were punishing them. I wouldn't have been that cruel to my own. This is a movie that simply appeals to no one (it's too adult for kids and too stupid for the teenage audience they would have been the better targeted crowd).Is the animation even worth noting? Even that suffers from the story. Because the majority of the emojis are necessarily bright for their use, this doesn't allow them to pop out. It's just a mess of pixilation and phone advertisements. This kind of movie makes me mad that millions of dollars are spent making this garbage over original stories that aspiring artists are trying to pitch.I'll give this one poop emojis out of five. This movie doesn't even deserve a formal ending, so I'll end it on this: Shame on you Sony Shame on you Sony Shame on you Sony Shame on you Sony",Negative

Here is what I think, first off its a kids movie so yes the plot wasn't made to be complex its made for kids. The only reason I took a star or two off is because it's not the first movie to do this. This is a mesh of Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out. (both have decent ratings) if you have kids its worth at least watching.",Negative

273,"This is considered the worst movie of 2017 and the worst animated feature to date. This movie maybe fun and colorful thanks to the computer animations but don't be fooled, it's really bad! I feel bad that Sir Patrick Stewart has been wasted in this ridiculous film as he is one of the most respected actors, those this not the first in which any acclaimed actor has degraded themselves to be part of any nonsense movie like Al Pacino in Jack and Jack back in 2011 which the worst of all.No words can i describe in this movie but it's all completely candy-and-digital garbage, and Sony is wasting their money on producing this piece of filthy and colorful bloody trash! It's so boring, absurd and horrendous! Recommend to families even children not to watch this insidious piece of garbage for their sake of their morality and their innocence.One simple word to tear it apart: MEH!",Negative

The plot is one of the most overused, and the jokes sub-par, but the characters were quite likable and the animation style was colourful and energetic, which Sony is known to be, like on Hotel Transylvania & Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs.Would be enjoyed more by younger children.Overall, I'd give it a 5/10.",Negative
277,"I can't believe how people are giving this such terrible reviews. It's a cartoon. It was not supposed to be a highly acclaimed film or some great hit.It's fun to watch and has a good story line and great visuals! Sure, besides using emojis, the plot may be less unique, but it was still a fun watch for day when you have nothing else to do. Most people giving this a 1 star review are being dramatic and overcritical, especially given that I've seen much worse movies in the theaters that ended up with 5 or 6 stars on IMBD. Also please ignore the 10-star reviews from trolls who are trying to be funny.Bottom line: Don't expect an instant classic and you will enjoy this! Give it a shot!",Negative
278,"Hated it. Here is why:
-As broken and cringe as humanly possible. I felt myself shiver during some scenes. I was just cheated out of 2 precious hours of my life.
-It was filled with product placements so blatantly pointless and awful I was hard pressed to not bury myself in a deep, deep hole in the ground with a ticking time bomb. A character even goes as far to say ""We have to make it to Dropbox!""
-It was boring. I expected at least a little bit of decent action. None.
-It is a rip off of a lot of animated miracles of the decade. Like Inside Out or The Lego Movie. Or Wreck it Ralph. It explores characters trying to express themselves (Inside Out), Crazy haired feminists (The Lego Movie's Wildstyle, except the ""feminist"" in The Emoji Movie was kind of a vehicle to propel what is right nowadays), and going to different apps (Wreck it Ralph, apps instead of video games).
-The ""jokes"" were so unoriginal and predictable and unfunny I had to have a cold water bottle next to me so I could douse myself to stop my brain from overheating.
-The ending of this abomination should have made me happy. You know, the movie is over, I can go back to living a regular life, but it didn't. It was so infuriatingly out of touch about how kids act nowadays that I was considering tearing out my brain and selling it for export so I wouldn't have to remember it. In fact, this whole movie was out of touch with what will make an audience happy. It only exists to capitalize on the popularity of emojis. I could shun this movie even more, but won't. Just, ignore it. Okay guys?
Thanks.",Negative

I think Patrick Stewart is a absolute brilliant actor and I'm so sad he was wasted on this epically terrible film!.The 10/10 views are fake as no normal person in their right mind would give that maybe being really generous 5/10.Anyway don't say I didn't warn you",Negative
280,"'THE EMOJI MOVIE': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A computer animated kids movie about a world of living emoji symbols, where a 'meh symbol' malfunctions and is hunted down to be deleted. The film stars the voices of T.J. Miller, James Corden, Anna Faris, Maya Rudolph, Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge. It was directed by Tony Leondis, and it was written by Leondis, Eric Siegel and Mike White. The movie has received almost unanimously negative reviews from critics and film fans alike (on IMDb at least), but it did do well at the Box Office still (kids seem to like it). I found it to be pretty pointless, and not really humorous at all, but it's not as bad as the reviews make it out to be either.The story is set in Textopolis; a digital city of emojis that all live inside the phone of a teenager named Alex (Jake T. Austin). Gene (Miller) is a meh symbol, who has the special ability to make many different expressions. On his first day of work, Gene panics and makes the wrong expression. This causes Alex to lose faith in his phone, and it puts all of Textopolis in danger. The leader of the text center, a smiley named Smiler (Rudolph), decides that Gene is a malfunction and she orders him to be deleted. Gene flees, with the help of a once popular emoji named Hi-5 (Corden), who's now lost his fame, and a hacker named Jailbreak (Faris). Smiler sends bots after them to delete Gene.The movie seems like a decent enough kids' flick; it's colorful, adventuresome and mildly amusing (the voice cast does decent enough work too). I of course wasn't entertained by it, but of course the movie wasn't made for me obviously. Kids seem to like it, so it's hard to claim that it's a horrible film. There's not much of anything in there for adults though, and it definitely doesn't have anything of substantial value to teach children. So I'd say it's an OK kids flick at best, that's definitely nothing special (that's for sure).",Negative
281,"Worst movie of 2017, by far. Full of cringy jokes, horrible story line, why was this movie created?",Negative
282,"i don't think i even need to describe this to you. no one expected this to be the least bit good. it's copying the whole idea for a movie from Wreck-it-Ralph and is using a concept or genre that is questionable within it's existence in the first place. Emoji's. However, it could have been something, SOMETHING, at least more than a complete waste of everyone's time. but it's not. there's no effort here. there's clearly no soul or dedication here either. if there was, not only would it not be a rip off Wreck-it-Ralph, but it flat out wouldn't exist in the first place, because no one wanted a movie about emoji's. you can ask people in the street and they'll either be offended that you even thought people wanted the emoji movie or not know what it is. some middle aged men wanted to make bank and thought that since the children these days use Emoji's practically everywhere they'd make money from every demographic. the only thing i want to know is how much they payed Patrick Stewart to be in this 2 hour long coma dream.",Negative
283,"(Warning: Contains Minor Spoilers) One does not watch a film like The Emoji Movie expecting anything but corporate pandering from a company as vile as Sony. However the film somehow managed to be worst than my expectations. Considering I have seen both The Nut Job and Minions in theaters, saying The Emoji Movie is the worst animated film I have ever seen, and one of the worst films I have ever seen, shows that the true quality of this film. What's the plot? Gene the emoji wants to become ""meh,"" as he is a malfunction. After destroying the emoji center, Smiler, who is simply annoying, wants to kill Gene. Gene finds a useless comic relief named Hi-Five, who leads him Jailbreak, a hacker emoji that has extremely forced character traits. You can assume that along the way there will be poop jokes, jokes that are so bad you don't even know they're jokes, bad outdated references, a void of likable characters and emotion (ironic for a film centered around emojis), forced feminism, a romance between meh and female meh that is focused on for around 20 minutes,and scenes, like the one centered in Just Dance, that are so blatantly awful and go on for so long, you will want to bludgeon yourself multiple times. Whenever you think the film can't get worse it does, and by the third act, my friends and I laughed so hard, since the ending was so nonsensical, pandering, and followed every cliché you've seen in other awful kids movies, like the ending dance sequence, except they are executed worse. One may say there are worse films than The Emoji Movie, and there probably are. And by that I mean there may be a few films worse than it. But the mentality behind this film, created from a greedy company that wants to create low-effort garbage to exploit a young audience while having the audacity to also make fun of that audience, as lazily as one could. This company pushes back reviews to allow films like this to do well, and says that the film isn't bad because it is made for a certain age group. This company has no purpose, other than to leech off of your money, and to continue releasing mass quantities of terrible films, like The Star, and potentially Peter Rabbit. The day Sony goes bankrupt will be happy day for all of humanity. Let's hope that day is sooner rather than later.",Negative
284,"Since ""Toy Story"" became an enormous box- office hit and a beloved modern masterpiece by giving audiences an inspired look at what ordinary toys do when their owners aren't around, Hollywood has been striving to repeat that seemingly simple formula with a number of animated films that have offered viewers a privileged glimpse at the heretofore unseen existence of everything from the shelves of a grocery store (the execrable ""Foodfight!"") to the psyche of a young girl (the stunning ""Inside Out""). Now comes ""The Emoji Movie,"" a film that dares to ask ""What goes on in the magical worlds contained within our cell phones?,"" a notion that I do not think that anyone has ever pondered for any amount of time outside of those stuck in a focus group at Sony Animation. That is only the first of many problems with this film, a work so completely devoid of wit, style, intelligence or basic entertainment value that it makes that movie based on the Angry Birds app seem like a pure artistic statement by comparison.The extremely dubious conceit of ""The Emoji Movie"" is that hidden within the messaging app in our phones is a teeming metropolis known as Textopolis, where all of the emojis live and wait to be called upon by their owners to say what mere words cannot. All emojis are supposed to have only one facial expression but Gene (T.J. Miller), who is supposed to be a ""meh"" like his parents (Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge), is just so darn exuberant that he is unable to stick with just one expression. This becomes a problem when his phone's owner, a 14-year-old boy named Alex struggling to reach out to the girl that he likes, selects Gene for a text he is sending to her—Gene chokes at the last second and coughs up so many expressions that it is impossible to understand what he is supposed to represent. Discovering his secret and fearing what it could mean for everyone if one emoji seems to be malfunctioning, Smiler (Maya Rudolph), the always-grinning leader of Textopolis, decides to have Gene wiped out for good. Gene manages to escape Smiler's clutches and with the help of another outcast emoji, the once-popular Hi-5 (James Corden), he hits upon a plan to have himself reprogrammed to show only one expression so that he can finally fit in. The only emoji who can do this for him is master hacker Jailbreak (Anna Faris), who agrees to help him if he will come with her on a journey to the fabled Cloud, where his ability to change expressions could help her get past the impenetrable firewall protecting it. Their journey across the phone takes the three to a number of different apps and along the way, they learn valuable lessons about Being Yourself and Friendship and the like while being pursued by Smiler's troops, who have all been outfitted with illegal upgrades to make them extra-powerful. To make matters worse, Alex, having grown increasingly annoyed by the glitches inadvertently caused by Gene's journey, has made an appointment to have his phone and everything contained within completely erased.So what wonders lie just beneath our touch screens, anyway? Based on the evidence put forth by ""The Emoji Movie,"" it is a combination of product placement and corporate synergy. Textopolis itself is an indifferently conceived and executed cityscape populated by any number of familiar emojis, the most famous of which is presumably Poop, who is voiced by none other than Sir Patrick Stewart in one of his less dignified gigs. Once we get outside the walls of Textopolis, we are essentially placed into a series of mini-ads for well- known apps that range from brief detours to the lands of Facebook and YouTube to extended commercials for the Candy Crush and Just Dance games. Since nothing of import goes on during these scenes (or any others, for that matter), I found myself speculating on which ones spent the most money to appear in the film based on the length of their exposure and the praise that they receive from the characters. Based on the available evidence, Dropbox must have been the big spender here—not only is it the all-important gateway to the Cloud but the characters manage to safely hide out from the bad guys there because, and I quote, ""they are illegal malware and this app is secure."" Then again, my guess is that the film could have gone into profit solely from taking money from companies eager to keep their apps as far away from this as possible.",Negative
285,"My 3 1/2 yr old niece & I came across this movie on Netflix!! She laid down and watched the whole movie with me, & we continuously laughed!!This was a very cute movie & one that as a Mom of a toddler, I was able to enjoy very much as well .

286,"I hate this movie. I mean, a movie about emojis? What the hell were these people thinking?!? First off, the plot. If you seen the endless spiral of cheesy ""Be YOURSELF"" kids movies, you seen the plot of this. Okay, it's this, an emoji has more than one emotion (gee, where have I've seen THIS before?), and the phone is getting deleted, IDK what else the plot is but product placement or ads. Second of all, the characters. They're the blandest characters I've seen all year. Gene is the generic ""guy who is different than the rest who is accepted in the end"", Hi-5 (who's idea of a name is this?), ""the comedy relief who is annoying and as hyperactive as a 3 year on sugar"", and Jailbreak, the ""hardened chick who is kinda of a feminist that would fit in well with the Tumblr crowd of edgy 20 somethings"" Also, there are other characters who are completely one dimensional and only used for ""teh plot"" and/or comedy. Finally, this movie sucked big time. The only positive thing is that most people hate it, including children. That restored some of my faith in humanity. Anyways, this is Princess Radar signing out.",Negative

289,"I only decided to watch this garbage because of its horrible rating. Wanted to see what the fuss was all about. Aside from the typical ""hero's adventure"" that has been played out in films over a thousand times, this movie in itself is basically one big commercial to sell apple, samsung phones and other products to kids. This is the end result when you have a generation of kids addicted to smart phones, you get bad movies designed purely to promote products, and not focus on actual original plot, dialogue, characters, etc. Waste of money, should've never bought that ticket. If you're reading this, don't buy their merchandise, or the tickets to movies like these. It only further promotes the production of garbage movies like this one.",Negative

In this movie all the kewl kids use the cellular devices to communicate with their peers. One young man starts telegramming his crush with these mobile phone hieroglyphics that the youths refer to as ""emojis"". Suddenly, we all get to learn how that technology really works. In my day, we had a rotary phone that took 2 minutes just to dial, AND WE LIKED IT. But these days the children's have an entire city called Textopolis in those dang devices. Sony seems to really be in touch with the youths of today with all the #edgyyy #relatable jokes and puns in this movie.",Negative

It's good one .By the end of the movie i wished there were some cooperation in some kind to make the emojis on the phone animated , better yet to have that surprising emoji
In conclusion,. It's not the best if you are looking for one ,but still deserve a chance and worth to watch so thumbs up 👍🏻",Negative

You can also expect an unhealthy dosage of terrible social commentary in this action packed meme.Us humans made a lot of mistakes, started wars, mistreated other creatures and made the emoji movie.

300,"The Emoji Movie is not the worst movie ever. Yes this movies has its limitations in a lot of places, and honestly, I can't think of another movie made blatantly based on the assumption, ""KIDS WILL WATCH ANYTHING!"" mentality but it's not the worst. I've heard people say, ""It's just a kids movie! Were you really expecting a masterpiece out of an emoji?""First off, animated movies have broken our expectations before. If you can make a masterpiece out of; a rat who wants to be a chef (Ratatouille), a penguin who can surf (Surf's up), oh and A PANDA WHO WANTS TO DO MARTIAL ARTS (Kung Fu Panda), you can make a good movie out of just about anything, regardless of who made it. Also, the ""It's just a kids movie"" is just the laziest excuse ever. I personally think that children deserve good movies too, and not just a distraction to gawk and laugh at. The movies I mentioned above can actually be enjoyable for people other than 5 year old's. And no, lovely animation and a 'good message' isn't enough anymore.I will say a few positives, like the animation is amazing, a few jokes got a guilty smile out of me, and I admire Jailbreak's line: ""How can you be number one, if there are no other numbers?"" So, one or two things to enjoy, but just skip it, and show your kids a better movie.",Negative
301,"I've been on record saying that I hate it when films, TV shows and content in general is released intending to appeal the younger demographic containing nothing to challenge them and just sticks to the safe route.What we're presented with here pretty much falls under that bracket as Sony farts out this abomination of a film which really just exists to sell advertising. How much of a base level have we sank to where we've gotten to the stage where Sony thinks we can be entertained by something so basic and pandering.The plot is essentially a rip off of Wreck it Ralph where TJ Miller emoji, Anna Faris emoji and James Corden emoji go off the rails trying to find sanctuary as opposed to their dull existence serving the phone user. The conundrum in the human world is just the phone user stressing out over what emoji to send his crush to win her affections. I'm just there thinking, ""are you actually kidding me?"" How out of touch are these mid-life crisis suffering writers, that they think that the youth of today will relate to something so insultingly simplistic?The product placement of the phone apps such as Twitter, Instagram, Candy Crush, etc. are incredibly on the nose too. It's pandering to the extent that you will almost be offended by it.Avoid this film at all costs. They cast Patrick Stewart as the poop emoji! How much of a deterrent do you need?!",Negative

Hi-5 joins him in escaping into the world of the phone. Hi-5 leads them into a pirate app to find hacker Jailbreak to fix Gene.The start is good. I like the old emoticons walking into the retirement home. Despite the really stupid premise, I'm still willing to give this a chance hoping for some old Tron magic. The start is simply a fake out as the movie deteriorates into nothing. I couldn't stand it even with the very short 80 minutes worth of viewing. The poop jokes are fully expected but still insufferable. Why would Alex send the Meh emoji in the first place? It's all bright colors and meaningless stupidity. It may still be enjoyable for really young kids with their first phones. They may have fun with this idiocy.",Negative

It's on par with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, or Wreck it Ralph.Sure it's by the numbers, but newsflash - they ALL ARE.It looked great, it was funny - enough - and it had just enough charm. To clarify: it succeeded by ticking all the boxes with the bare minimum, but it's so similar to movies of its kind, I cannot understand why it's rated so low.Because if you liked Bee Movie, you're going to like this. OK so it's not quite as well rounded as Bee Movie (or in fact any of the successful animated movies), but it's certainly not far off.Ultimately it's a silly 90 minutes - and that's all it was ever supposed to be.I was pleasantly surprised.",Negative
318,I didn't believe that this movie was going to be as bad as other reviews said it was. I was wrong. After watching this movie I had to take a break from life. I returned home and laid down on the couch and just stared at the ceiling. I couldn't do anything and to be honest I didn't want to. I started questioning the reality of this world and the future of animation. It's safe to say that I became a hollow shell of my former self after seeing this movie. Jitterbug echos in my head every time I close my eyes now thanks to this corporate garbage.,Negative
319,"""It's just a kids film, you don't have to be to harsh on it"" An average excuse from people who don't understand the power of animation. A medium that let's your imagination fly with emotional and powerful movies, with great messages and great different styles, and what did Sony Pictures Animation offered to us? An 88-minute evil, stupid, manipulative and offensive commercial. Yes, it's a commercial, not a movie. Because the film is so focused to promote apps and emojis instead of thinking how to make this movie work.People might be overrating the Lego movies, but it's justified. As much as it's an excuse to sell Legos, it had an actual creative team that thought a good script first, and then how to sell it. Same case with Toy Story, they had a creative and inspired team that loved animation and cared about this concept as silly it sounds, and it worked.The emoji movie doesn't want to be creative, funny or at least unique in any aspect. It's your typical ""be yourself"" movie but with characters that are mean spirited with no personality, with a story that makes no sense and with really bad morals about treating the rest of people. This is a ""movie"" that embraces the smartphones and apps and tells you that you should depend on your phone instead of talk with real people and live the real life.This is a ""movie"" that manipulates you with pop songs, random and stupid jokes, bad animation and awful dialogue to buy everything they offer in this commercial and to make you think that the things they say in this movie is ""profund"".This is a ""movie"" that says that it's OK to be yourself, but you need to break rules and do nothing to fix your problem unless it's buying a smartphone.This is a ""movie"" that it's already dated by the time to review is posted, that shows no compassion to the kids, that treats the audience like stupid people who went to see this and insults every piece of minimum of cleverness just to the sake to sell toys about emojis.Sony Pictures Animation failed so bad to make this movie a franchise and it shows they don't know how to make a good animated movie, because they are more focused on how to market this towards children.It's a waste of time and no other kid should see this by its own merits ever again. It needs to be banished from the history of film making and from the art of animation.You want to show something for your kids? Let them watch anything else instead of Emoji movie. Because it doesn't teach anything good, it's mean spirited, it's too stupid to be taken seriously and it's too annoying and uninspired to be a comedy.Don't watch it ironically, don't watch it for the memes, don't watch it as a family film, just avoid everything that it's related with this horrible product.

I don't have any positives for this Movie except one, and that is that people will at least stay up for this Movie and not fall asleep and you will be waiting to get out the theater to tell your friends how bad this Movie is.

No other movie has ever made me want to blind and deafen myself as much as this film yet, I'm sure if I watched this properly it would have given me some sort of mental retardation and I properly would've enjoyed the array of pretty colours. Whilst in the cinema I did actually hear a child laugh, I really hope this was either out of irony for how bad it was or they were laughing at their parents for wasting their money on this piece of 💩. Five reasons why this film does get 1 star however:1. It makes me appreciate how every other film isn't this one 2. It brought me closer to death and ergo out of a world that creates something like the emoji movie.3. It gave me the greatest feeling I've ever had when it ended4. Amy Schumar wasn't in it 5.

If you can even call it a movie, it's the worst movie ever made! And there have been lots of bad animated films, hell lots of films in general, what is this the year 2017. But I think this one takes the awful cake made out of rotten eggs made out of smartphone emoji's. It's a rip off of The Lego Movie, Inside Out, and Wreck it Ralph all at once, and it is beyond any doubt the worst thing that Sony ever created. Worse than Hotel Transylvania, worse than Open Season, worse than the Smurfs reboot, worse than the Annie remake, worse than Battlefield Los Angeles, worse than After Earth, worse than Pixels, worse than Ghostbusters 2016. There may be films that are worse in plot like Home on the Range, worse aesthetically like Shark Tale, or worse character wise like Norm of the North. But in terms of overall quality, this is the all time low! Stay away! Stay away as far as possible! THE ABSOLUTE ONLY THING THIS MOVIE CAN DO IS MAKE YOU APPRECIATE OTHER MEDIA! If you disregard my previous advice and watch this film anyway, and somehow manage to sit through it, don't expect a gold medal. You just wasted your time, and I feel bad for you. Likewise if you got this warning too late, once again you have my condolences, especially if you're on the younger side. BUT, you will be able to actively appreciate other media. You'll look at Jurassic World the way you see King Kong, you'll see Sword Art Online the way you see The Last Airbender (the TV series), and you'll see Brave the way you see Toy Story! Go watch any of those before you see this movie, but if you ignore my advice, whenever you watch another form of media at least you'll be able to say without a doubt, ""I've seen a lot worse.""",Negative

AT&T has this deal BOGO, and my daughter wanted to watch it right after she saw the trailer a while ago. How bad it could be? REALLY, REALLY, REALLY BAD! My girl is 7. She watches some dumb shows/movies on Netflix or Disney Jr. channel. I thought I've seen enough of those things to prepare myself for anything this Emoji movie can throw at me. Oh sh!t I was naive! This is the first movie I can bet $10000 on how it would end just after 5 minutes into the plot. And there is ABSOLUTELY no highlight point throughout the 80 minutes of bore. I would have completely fallen asleep within 20 minutes if I was not the only adult accompanying my girl.It is absolutely fitting that the main character is called Meh. All conversations are Meh. Jokes are meh. Story lines are meh. I understand our reliance on, or addiction to, digital gadgets is somewhat inevitable in our lives, but PLEASE! Not everyone is a freaking teenager trying to live through his life by texting. With emoji! Words of wisdom: wait for reviews of movie before buying your tickets.",Negative

I suggest that you save your money and watch something else.",Negative

It sort of says something about yourself, if you rate this film only one star, it means you just want to be so overly negative. This film/movie is a lot better than 1/10.I actually like this film, I have watched it, and I think it is good how emojis were made into a movie, which is obviously what this film is.I did write this review mostly to say that I really disagree with all of the very low reviews (mostly all of the 1/10 reviews, as I said above).",Negative

Also, I thought the storyline was great and the animation was also very good. The use of apps in my opinion felt clever rather than a money maker. We laughed along throughout, enjoyed the puns and found the online rating quite harsh. The voice of James corden as high-five and Jennifer Coolidge as Meh's mum really quite entertaining. We managed to play a drinking game along to this and it was so funny, we drank a few bottles of wine and genuinely had a good time! Would recommend if you want an easy-going film to put on.",Negative

I found the antagonist actually pretty creepy, as are all perpetually happy people.Ultimately I came away feeling warmly about the movie for it's rich, distinctive world, positive message and how it embodies an aspect of its time while tying it to a universal them even if it's not exactly subtle about it.",Negative

We are a family of all ages from 6 to 50 and did not watch this movie for quite a while BECAUSE of its bad ratings (3.0). (so it should be one of the worst movies of all times).
After watching it, all of us completely disagree. It quite is funny, has some nice twists and an ok story. It one of the many 5.5 to 6.0 animations that are entertaining and easy to watch. 
I cannot understand either the rating nor some of the bad critics here.
Why is it a problem to have some similarities to other stories? (and hey yess Inside out has a trash dump too, and in Wreck it Ralph they also changing between apps)The book of life plays partially in the ""world of the remembered"" and Coco does too, that does not mean Coco is any less of a great movie.Don´t get me wrong! Of course the Emoji Movie is NOT Coco. But to my opinion its a solid 5 or even a weak 6. ...and to all those who said ""we´ve seen it all before"" here some IMDB ratings with no further comments ...

The plot basically says that it is alright for a social outcast to be himself. Along the way, the story utilises expressions, games and apps in daily life.

There were a lot of moments which could have come out better if someone with a little more creativity worked behind this.

I'm not saying this is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen (oh believe me, I have seen WAY WORSE), but this is still a horrible animated film. The writing is absolutely awful. It's like they didn't even TRY to put any sort of effort in the script. It's an obvious ripoff of 3 animated films MUCH better than this film: Wreck-It Ralph, The LEGO Movie and Inside Out. The characters are unlikable and very mean-spirited, while others are just dull and forgettable.The visuals were okay, but other than that The Emoji movie is a heap of unoriginality, and is just plain awful.

And by gum, was it bad.So, so bad.Bad enough it took me nearly three months just to work up the courage to write a quick review. The characters/actors... it was downright depressing hearing Sir Patrick Stewart, one of the finest actors alive, voicing a character named... Poop. Ugh. But generally, the characters were awful. The female lead, I wanted to fling her out a window. She's loathsome. The comedic sidekick was only made worse by James Corden's poor performance. And Eugene, the main lead, was just irritating and unappealing. The comedy is dreadful. The plot, frightful. The little girl I went with fidgeted the whole time; not once did she laugh or smile. She seemed bored. So don't try and claim 'kids will like it'. Kids are too good for this. This is an ad. A poorly done ad. Avoid it- you can't even MST3K this thing. Abandon all hope, ye who view.",Negative
375,"In my ""Top Gun"" review, I said there was nothing wrong with the 'commercial' look of the film since the product placement is the whole setting. I sarcastically added: 'except for the emoji movie'. To be fair, I hadn't seen the movie. Now, I did. Do I withdraw my statement? Nope.But let's face it, criticizing ""The Emoji Movie"" would be like Homer Simpson repetitively hitting the Krusty burglar with that kid crying ""stop it, stop it, he's already dead"". No need to punch the cadaver or shoot the ambulance as French say, ""The Emoji Movie"" achieve one milestone by becoming the first film to win the Worst Picture Razzie... it did so brilliantly that commentators went pretty creative on it (one remembers the Rotten Tomatoes consensus). I'll try to be more constructive.Let's examine the film. First, it's not the 'product placement' that is problematic, besides ""Top Gun"", you have many quality films that couldn't do without brandname-dropping (""The Social Network"", ""Cast Away""...). The real insult is that the writers took our 'wow' for granted just because we're having familiar everyday technology on the big screen. Some bits like the Firewall or the Dropbox were okay but did we need that lengthy dancing app sequence? Couldn't have they come up with something more imaginative with at least ONE social network?Some would argue that the real mistake was to make a bland cardboard character out of the young smartphone owner... and that predictable crush no one could care about. I think it's downright impossible to make a deep soul connection between emojis and people à la ""Inside Out"" (which it obviously ripped off). It's tough enough to make emojis as relatable as humans but humans are bound to appear as predictable and boring as emojis if they're defined by them. Now, would have the film worked better if it was just about Emojis? You know, like the Smurfs... but how do you make an Emoji movie without their main users?Gosh, must have been one hell of a brainstorming session in that conference room!Now, supposing humans are relegated to supporting players (after all, it did work for the Lego movie) but then how about the Emoji characters? You have a 'Meh' emoji who refuses to be defined by one expression: we got it: MISFIT. You have Jailbreak as the female who doesn't want to be 'categorized' and rejects love, we got it: GIRL POWER. Hi-5 is the comical sidekick, and Patrick Stewart is the prestigious cameo, voicing Poo. And you know what? That's not even the problem.Have a respectable actor voice a poo, and it's an average gag at best. Have him say only poo-related jokes, it kills, annihilates and exterminates the fun. Humor is a matter of contrast, so let's just have a poo behaving like a respectable citizen (did I just write that?) Having the Big Bad as a Smiley was an interesting twist... although nothing new (cough *Joker*). Now, don't get me start on 'Meh' parents, the most tired joke of the film, and the responsible for a puzzlement I never thought I'd have: do emojis reproduce? Do 'Meh's go only with 'Meh's? Are emojis racist? Do a crying and a happy one made a happy tears one?Like another film I reviewed recently, ""The Emoji Movie"" is a film that the more it makes sense, the less it does. The premise is ludicrous though it had potential, the treatment was predictable but exploiting many overused tropes from better movies, the product placements were superficial, the human world didn't make us care and ultimately, it's hard to imagine Emojis as living creatures.Finally, I remembered the way I use my own emojis: my favorite are the Thumbs Up when I want to save myself writing two lines of approval, the kissing heart when I receive pictures of babies... which makes me realize that I hate when I get only emojis as answers. Let's be honest, emojis are semantic loopholes, products of our intellectual laziness and yet the film portrays them as a pillar of the new-age communication. I wouldn't say no one wants to watch a movie to remember how lobotomized we are by these little creatures... but not one that gives a noble dimension to their existence.Now, there's a hidden relevance in the film, something that could have elevated it to the level of social comment, had it dared to have an edge, to end with a moral twist where the boy would win the girl's heart by just talking to her... how about having that message communicated to the climax 'talk to her' or something like that... that the film obviously makes the emojis the alpha and omega of the life of a teenager could only foreshadow its failure. Not to say that there aren't good moments, the animation can please the kiddies on a mindless level, although the graphics might be too overstimulating.Still, I'm glad the film was made because if cinema needs masterpieces, it also needs a few occasional big stinks. Movies like ""Cats"" or ""Batman and Robin"". Movies that reveal how far Hollywood marketing can go in its faith on our mediocrity and how low it can sink for the sake of cash-making flashy idiocy.Cinema needs movies that make audience say ""enough is enough', movies that show that even the lousiest gimmicks are supposed to serve a plot, that kids aren't just dim-witted consumers who'd grab anything just because it's got pretty nice colors.There's a limit to how far you can push the me-toos (I mean the marketing strategy) to emulate dinosaurs, while reality put you back to the state of La Fontaine's frog that wished to be as big as an Ox and so she started puffing herself out and kept doing it more and more. What happened to her is the perfect metaphor for ""The Emoji Movie"" ultimate fate.",Negative
376,"Being a person who's outer expression is mostly 'meh', I will now be reminded of this movie whenever I'm aware of my outward indifference.
So now I feel like I've been forever tainted.Most people have slammed this as the worst thing to ever be made. That's harsh, even though I don't completely disagree. But I have seen worse things.
Still, why 2 stars and not 1 or less?
Well, 1 is for the voicing talent of T.J. Miller. I like the guy. He's what made the Silicon Valley series funny. And here, just hearing his voice, felt comforting. He's like that friend with the cool voice and the interesting stories (true or not) who can talk forever non-stop, but you don't mind because they fill up a void with life. They entertain when you can't be bothered to make an effort. The life of the party when you're happy to take a backseat and just chill whilst nursing your drink. He makes a good buddy.The other 1 star just has to go to the sheer audacity of making a movie about emojis in the first place.
What would Disney and Pixar writers from 20 years ago make of this? Even the writers of the dystopian Wall-E (2008) would have not predicted the dystopian direction of something like The Emoji Movie becoming a reality.
Still, the pitch to Sony (or Columbia Pictures) would have been easy enough.
'Emojis come in a variety of expressions,' they would say. 'So many of them. And each of them can be a different character. Then there's all the animals. And body parts. And objects. And... all the other things you can send in a text that isn't a letter. All of those are characters, so the world building is easy peasy.
At this point, Sony (or Columbia Pictures) are almost on board. 'But what about the story?' they'd say.
Well, for the producers, that would be the easiest part. Just take a bit of Inside Out (the behind-the-scenes universe) and a bit of Wreck-it-Ralph adventure, and there you have it. The same old rehashed story told from another perspective. They'd argue that kids and young teens would gobble it up. Seeing their favorite emojis up on the screen would be a thing they never knew they loved, up until that moment.
'Just think of all the stuffed and plastic emoji toys that could follow after the movie's success,' they'd say.It was a gutsy move. Especially that it was a move made by grown-up responsible adults. Serious people talked about this in conference meetings and studio discussions and writer/animator sessions.Maybe the whole thing was a dare between the producers and creators? See if they could get something like this green-lit? Because that type of boldness deserves some form of respect, surely.
(Nevertheless, Netflix would have happily payed for it anyway if Sony had said no. But Netflix is hardly a challenge in getting something through, so they wouldn't count).",Negative
377,"The storyline is generic and shallow - clichéd and uninspired, it feels less like a movie and more like a long commercial for smartphones and emojis. The overt product placement is distracting, making the whole thing feel like an extended advertisement rather than a genuine story with heart or originality.The humor falls flat with forced jokes and cringeworthy pop culture references that don't land. I agree with most critics and audiences: the comedy is unfunny and feels like it's trying too hard.What really disappoints is that this movie doesn't even come close to the quality of popular animated films. Sony canceled a promising Popeye project, and instead, we got this forgettable, meme-worthy disaster. I can only imagine the Popeye movie would've been a far better choice and likely received better reviews than the highly unpopular Robin Williams Popeye movie.The Emoji Movie feels like a cheap ripoff of Wreck-It Ralph, The Lego Movie, and Inside Out. I love those movies, but this one only manages to tarnish their legacy by comparison. Emojis are fun online, but turning them into characters going on a ""phone adventure"" is not creative or engaging.Honestly, it's not worth your time.Please don't let them make a sequel-The Emoji Movie 2 would only continue this unwatchable mess.",Negative
378,"I know I'm a little late to writing a review for this movie but I just had to, after hearing how bad It Is and trailers didn't help one bit, I just had to see It and I didn't plan to, even the Nut Job 2 looked more funny then this... but that's not saying much.A little story before hand that's more funnier then the movie It's self, before It started me and my friend went to get our tickets by using a Unlimited card (Instead of paying my own money Instead thank god..), we go Into a screening, I sit down, put my snack and drink down and It was empty, just how I wanted It.But then the trailers started and were rated 15, which was strange because the film was rated PG (even though It was shown U on the BFFC Ident for some reason..) so I go outside and wait for my friend to come back, she does come back and I told her we might be at the wrong screening, so I look at the ticket and I was right we were at the wrong one, so we go Into the right one, I took a deep breathe before I went In and as I went In there was other people, not slit only like a group, like maybe three adults and three kids, so as film went on they were laughing with the movie, the puns the y'know ""Unfunny"" stuff.So I sat down and watched the film and..... yeah, It's terrible, like HOLY F**KING S**T! It's terrible and I'm not just saying that or agreeing It's true, where do I begin?, oh let's start with the concept which as expected copies Disney's Wreck-It Ralph, Pixar's Inside Out and a bit of LEGO Movie In there, three really great films that are WAY better then this... this! GARBAGE!.Another Issue Is the plot, characters and humour, why all In one?, because they are all same like In most kids movies, bland and very mean-spirited characters, generic plot and hit or miss humour and this movie does exactly that, I'll admit I did get a couple of chuckles out of this movie, coming from HI-5 and that's about It, that's properly the closest to be funny, everything else Is just cringey, unfunny and insulting, even the moral of being yourself really makes It more obviously cringey that It completely ripoff Inside Out!.The only plots that there Is are Gene's parents going out of Textroplis to look for him and main villain Smiler going on about deleting Gene and they are really pointless and predicable that they might as well remove It entirely, the characters also got through a lot of apps like YouTube, Facebook even the Twitter bird Is a character, they even show ApplePen on YouTube... and Gene says hashtag.. I'm not kidding, these people must be so obsessed with putting lots of advertising In their own movie about Emojis!... good grief..I guess the only tolerable that I like Is the animation, It's colorful, looks nice and well designed, well on the humans, the Emojis just look basic and dull, maybe If all of the problems I mentioned were fixed In a YouTube series about Emojis, I would of been fine with that, but to be released AS A MOVIE?! IN CINEMAS?! THIS IS LITTERLY CANCER!.So yeah the Emoji Movie SUCKS!, It's dull, unfunny, clichéd, characters are a-holes, the idea and moral rips off other successful movies and the concept makes no sense, the animation Is okay and Hi-5 did me chuckle a couple of times, even the voice acting from talented people like TJ Miller, James Corden, Anna Farris and even Patrick Stewart feel wasted on this... piece of s**t!, jus... just don't see guys, they are better kids films out there to watch like Cars 3, Despicble Me 3 and Captain Underpants which I think are stilling In cinemas at this point.I wish to forget this movie entirely, It's worse then Norm of the North! and Ice Age: Collision Course!, yes I just said that Norm of the North was averagely bad and Ice Age 5'has some good things In It.As expected I'm giving this cancerous movie 0/10, do I need to explain why?",Negative

It has to be smile emoji, meh emoji, etc and not a ""multi-talented"" emoji. You know, like Monster Inc movie where one of the main conflicts was about who could scare kids the most.",Negative
382,"Overall I believe the movie creatively summed up the moral of ""be yourself"". This is an important lesson and was portrayed throughout. This is evident in the trailer so this is not a spoiler.I thought it was OK. The animation was quite good and there was some relatable and creative moments which I think was the only thing this movie had going for it. There was also some cheeky product placement which was very obvious however there were some funny relatable smart phone moments (not going into too much detail) that did make me chuckle... NOT laugh. (big difference).This movie is basically your cliché animated kids movie.. it has some humor that is slightly funny, a villain, and an end goal. I predicted the ending within the first 10 minutes of watching the film. I was right. There were so many opportunites missed with this film but I am surprised at the 1.5 average rating.

When someone asked me how the movie was I was going to say it was amazing, but that wouldn't have done the movie justice. The movie was an extremely moving, emotional experience. As a non-Christian who nevertheless respects the historical figure of Jesus Christ and the beauty of his philosophy and teachings, I found The Emoji Movie to be a powerful portrayal of much that I think is worthwhile about the Christ story. I know the film has been maligned for anti-semitic content (perhaps because Gene make mistakes in the film and are seen as the villain instead of the hero), and for various other problems - but let's face it - any movie portraying this subject was bound to face strong reactions. And kudos to Tony Leondis for not shying away from the subject by creating a sterile, gutless, Disney story out of what really was a good example of the everyday horror of life on the fringes of the millennial empire. Leondis invents a new genre with The Emoji Movie - that of historical horror. The performances in this film are inspired. I felt that the film brought out the cowardice of the apostles very forcefully, and the courage of Gene life was palpable to the very end. I also felt that the voice acting from James Corden was one of a kind and compelling - almost making me believe that he was truly a Hi-5 in real life! Final word - this is not a film for the whole family nor is it a feel-good film. Don't see it if you're not willing to confront the worst aspects of human nature up close. And don't go in looking for your own version of the story - it's not your film! This is what Tony Leondis believes, and it's his own revelation, not necessarily to be shared by all.",Negative
387,"The worst movie I have seen...even not worse commenting on.......just do not waste your precious time on it!!!1. terrible humor, I would say no humor at all 2. terrible quality, though with nowadays technology and possibilities could be much better 3. after watching the trailer, supposed to be cool, original and funny.....but the trailer, in fact says all about the movie, so you can end up there!",Negative

389,"The Emoji MovieGrowing up the only emoticon you were allowed to feel was: Smiling Face.As per this animated-adventure: Now there's a myriad of symbols to emote your psychosis.Inside of a teenager's phone lives a multifaceted face emoji, Gene (T.J. Miller), that doesn't want to be defined by his 'meh' designation, like his parents, so he teams up with a HI-5 sign (James Corden) and a hacker (Anna Faris) that can help fix his glitch before Gene is deleted.But to repair Gene they must survive Candy Crush, Instagram and Spotify.A platform for app and software companies to reach impressionable young minds, this commercial masked as a 3-D kids cartoon is corporate brainwashing.

It made crap loads of money, even though everyone hated it.Please stop ironically giving this product good reviews. And someone hand me a bottle of cyanide.",Negative
391,"Never has a movie made me as unreasonably angry as this movie has. Even before I watched, I could feel a pit of loathing form in the depths of my psyche. Probably because the movie's assertion that ""emojis are the most important form of communication"" offends me on a spiritual level. Or perhaps the very existence of this film reminds me just how banal, insipid, and base Hollywood's process of filmmaking has become. Rather than attempt to break new ground by trying something new with a new IP, Corporate executives, in their never-ending obsession to never take any risk, have birthed this cosmic terror upon the universe. This movie is the Foodfight of a new generation. There is no artistic merit to this movie, no philosophical message to convey besides the usual schlock one inserts into a children's movie such BE YOURSELF, YOU'RE SPECIAL, and all that drivel which might hit home in any other movie. This movie only exists to be a 1-hour and 31-minute advertisement. This film wastes substantial time with parts that suffer cancerous inclusion of real world apps, such as Spotify, Instagram, Just Dance, and Dropbox. If you might be thinking that The Emoji Movie is something that your children might want to see, shove those thoughts away now, because waterboarding is a more substantial past-time to inflict upon them. Your kids deserve so much better than this, an over glorified ad that is a microcosm of everything wrong with modern Hollywood.",Negative

All I can say is steer clear of this monstrosity and protect your kids from ever having to see this. It will cause a huge traumatic experience and will leave them scarred for life.

These primitive neanderthals think they have a sense of art? The morals and themes fly straight through there heads, while they are scratching their a**es for an hour and thirty minutes. Marlon Brando would be rolling in his grave, to see such an artistic beauty, rated a 2.8/10!

403,"This movie was basically a propaganda piece. The whole plot, characters and story line was just dire and completely unsuitable for young children watching. None of my children enjoyed the film which is not surprising. At the end you were left with a weird unsatisfied feeling that the film had achieved nothing and that was because the characters had achieved nothing.Again we see the result of basically feminist bs being fed into a film, and because they have been rejected and have ultimately failed in their love life they appear to want characters in films they have influence over to do the same thing. Some of the dialogue from the female lead character was also deeply unsuitable for children of a young age.",Negative

It's that unoriginal and lazy. I really feel particular disappointment in Patrick Stewart, whom I have enjoyed watching in the Star Trek franchise and the X-Men movies, but I guess even he is willing to sell his soul to play talking poop if the pay check is right. A shame.",Negative
407,"After hearing what people said about this movie, I didn't have high hopes. Im sad that I am just now watching this beautifully animated movie. I went into it thinking it would be the worst movie I've ever seen, but after watching it, I feel bad for saying that. It's funny, lighthearted, and it takes you on a nice adventure. It really inspired me to take a hammer to my head. I highly recommend watching this if you haven't already:)",Negative
408,"Where do we begin.Let's start with the whole concept of this movie. This is a prime example of the older generation trying too hard to appeal to us 'millennials' by including emojis. Instead, I feel more insulted more than anything, as the movie depicts us as zombies glued to our phones, as shown in the intro scene. They also canceled a Popeye movie for this garbage, which is truly disgraceful. Moving on to the content of this movie, let me start with saying it includes a plethora of unfunny poop jokes and puns that you can see coming a light-year away. If the writers believe their targeted audience would find their jokes humorous, then the writers are incompetent, immature five-year-olds. The plot is as barren as the surface of Pluto. There are no relevant plot twists and you can predict the exactly how everything is going to end, so I'm not sure if anyone can have the movie spoiled for them. The character are all empty clichés. A hero with no personality. Check. A comic relief. Check. A love interest for the hero. Check. A generic villain. Check. Every other character in an irrelevant one-liner. What were the themes of this movie? That's a tough one. All I could think of is... express your emotions? Which frankly is bullsh*t.tl;dr: Only watch this movie ironically. If you want decent things to watch, avoid this movie like a pile of feces contaminated with Ebola.",Negative

411,"When I saw how much hate 'The Emoji Movie' was getting, I decided I had to see it for myself to see if it was justified. An animated kid's film with a sizeable budget couldn't possibly be that bad, right? Wrong. It is every bit as bad as the reviews suggest.This is by far and away the worst animated movie I have ever seen. It has literally nothing going for it, with everything from the plot to the script and characters being nothing short of dreadful. As if the idea itself isn't bad enough, they then have the audacity to stuff it full of product placement. It angers me to think that people actually went to the cinema to see what is effectively a 90 minute long advert.'The Emoji Movie' is just another example of a pitiful Hollywood cash grab, jumping on a social trend to make a quick buck. It is insulting even to the young children it is supposed to please. The worst film of the year by far!",Negative

No, I believe that's already been done to death. ""This movie sucks?"" No that's not it either. From now on, I'm just gonna call it the epitome of losing faith in humanity until I find a description that verbally and physically fit the movie's crude, idiotic, and juvenile ideas of humor! I doubt that NOBODY laughs when I get to see it. What reality does this movie deserve to exist?! I really want to know, I'm genuinely curious at this point. In this reality, it's conventional wisdom that it takes a sane person to prevent this movie from being made. What am I saying, it's already been made! I've seen bad movies and it never bothers me at the slightest. I'd seen Pixels! Hell, I'd even seen the Ghostbusters reboot! I'd even seen Transformers and not the sequels! Now, I've officially learned by the doing the right thing of seeing Atomic Blonde instead of the Emoji Movie. This animated film with a target demographic of children may get to thank it's ""lucky stars"" every second of every day that whatever the writers sold their souls to was stupid enough to make a quick buck. I think I believe calling it a kids movie is not going to work anymore, because children deserve better instead of being bored. I don't know any movie that would lower itself so substantially to even reluctantly want its demented, poisoned mind around.Just get out of the movies, Emoji Movie and go back to the cancerous sludge you came from, because believe me, it's for your own good! 0/10!",Negative

The disgusting and depressing movie makes me want to go outside and hang myself. The sadness and coldness it brings to my heart is disgusting. I'm terrified of Sony. What will they do next? Publicly execute someone? No... no.... that's better than the Emoji Movie. There is so much more to this 'Emoji Movie' that makes me want to die... I literally left the room I was watching it in and nobody at all was surprised. I, myself am surprised none of the other people came with me. One of them was sitting on their phone the whole time, anyways, considering the boring aspect and truly disturbing, edgy characters. It's extremely cliché and soul-crushing, you could just call it death. For the time I was in the room, I felt like I was being dipped in nuclear waste while on painkillers. You feel agony, then nothing, and then the agony of having your skin peeled off, and then you're dead. Nothing of who you were remains. This movie is like a badly made sandwich. It has the formula/order for one but the components are made of horse sh*t. The dialog was worse than a babbling toddler. The story is not boring, for it is revoltingly insulting to the budget this movie has somehow been trusted with. Seriously, the worst part has to be the budget.",Negative

So, I had to see what the fuss was about. And I've got to say, its pretty embarrassing that we live in a world where something like this exists. I am a huge fan of animated films and I think they can appeal to any demographic. But this movie gives the business a bad rep. Hopefully other studios will see this disaster and try their best to avoid films like this. Sony Pictures is in a landslide with this one and its going to take something drastic to recover from this. I just don't see them making many more films after this. Who knows? Maybe the film's 50 million dollar budget will save it. But money aside, this is without a doubt an abomination. I'm not even going to get into the issues because it will take all day to write it. If you want to take a chance to see for yourself, go ahead. But don't say I or the tons of other critics didn't warn you. This is a film for the ages, and not in a good way. Oh yeah, Patrick Stewart voices a piece of poop. Can't believe I have to say that.

I might as well just have received a kick in the nuts, at least the pain from that would fade! I remember my dad telling me about the times he went to see The Exorcist and A Clockwork Orange in the early 1970's and when he left the cinema, he and the rest of the audience were greeted by members of the Salvation Army at the cinema entrance giving everyone at the screening leaflets containing phone numbers to psychiatrists you should ring if you were psychologically effected by the film's content. I can definitely say I'll be needing therapy over the next few weeks to get rid of the horrible images of cringy ""poop"" jokes, awkward unfunny lines and the endless product placements of iPhone apps erased from my mind.No doubt there will be people trying to defend this *cough* ""movie"" by saying ""It's a kids movie, what do you expect!"" No. There are plenty of kids movies from both past and recent times like The Lion King,Toy Story, Inside Out and Wreck It Ralph (which btw are movies this film rips off) which the makers actually put thought, effort and care into their project and not some cheap lifeless unfunny 85 minuet advert for social media, Facebook, candy crush and other phone apps.

420,"This review will be short because I can sum it up in just a few words.This is the first time (out of thousands of movies) That I have ever gave a 1 out of 10.Longer version : There simply wasn't a single redeemable part of this movie. The animation was terrible (seriously it looks like something from 2004 not 2017), the story line um....there really isn't one except ""Three unlikely friends have to save the world, but really don't do much to reach the goal until the final Macguffin. For an all star cast, it sounded like the actors all had guns to their head. Stale deliveries abound like the 800 product placements that litter this movie. In other words, I can almost always find something good in a movie. I never give out 1's. I VERY Rarely give a 10. To me, an 8 means it's a great movie. A 10 means it's just a work of art and transcends being just a movie. I think the worst score I've ever given before was a 3 because even in bad movies, there are redeeming qualities such as maybe great cinematography or a particular scene or actor that stuck out, or even just good editing.This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I took my niece and nephew to it (7 and 9 years old) and even they were asking ""Can we just leave and go watch a different movie?"" about 20 minutes in. And that's exactly what we did.Seriously, I hate that most people vote either 1 or 10 most of the time because why have a scale at all if you are one of those people. In this case, this movie deserves all of the 1's it gets.The only reason it is even rated 1.6 is because of the blatantly obvious corporate review shrills. So after being on IMDb for like 13 years now, I finally found a movie that was so bad that it earned my first 1 star rating. I'd give it a 0 if I could.",Negative

Well, it wasn't, and The Emoji Movie has to be the worst movie I've seen in quite some time. Some kids may find some enjoyment in this movie, but it's all from stupid jokes and seeing their favorite app in an animated movie. I think the biggest issue with this movie is the lesson it is expressing to kids. This movie's lesson is go on your phones and use emojis. That's the legit lesson, I am not kidding. Kids aren't learning anything good when watching this film, so they shouldn't watch it ever. I watched it with friends as a joke, and it actually was fun because we made fun of everything going on in the movie. The plot of this movie is very simple yet dumb, I feel like a seven year old could've made the script of this movie. Just the whole concept of emojis on phones going on an adventure sounds dumb. The Emoji Movie made $217 million at the box office!!! Like, why, what a waste of money. The budget was $50 million, and that money could've been used for a new film maker to make their first theatrical release, or could've been donated to charity. I think that $50 million was a big oof by sony animation. Making the movie was also a waste of time. That time making the movie could've been used to volunteer at a local soup kitchen, or making a better movie. I'd obviously give The Emoji Movie a 1/10.",Negative

Main idea of the movie seems to be hand jokes, name dropping different apps and references to basically any entertainment related things. Towards the end I was just trying to find all these references. It's like the movie tried to take the plot from wreck-it Ralph and Inside out, but fails miserably. Mix in some forced gender equality and you end up with a pretty bad movie. Best parts were cat video, poop emoji and few actually funny hand jokes. But too much is too much. I did watch the whole movie, so it wasn't all bad. Maybe if it wasn't just about the puns, the movie could've had it's moments. Now there really weren't.",Negative

I do use a smiley face from time to time and a few others, but emojis started getting out of hand as people literally think crap is cute thanks to stupid emojis. So guess what, they made a movie out of them! Yes, why not, you have a built in product tie in as there are already emoji pillows and such out there. So Sony, makes another huge mistake to go along with making Ghostbusters again and promoting it by attacking its audience, by screwing up Spider-man twice by making two sets of films with no proper endings to either (thankfully, they finally let Marvel help) by making an emoji movie and they make it as bad as one would think a film about pointless symbols can be! Seriously, the story is horrid.The story has emojis living within our phones and they live in an emoji town. They go to their job which is a box where they get scanned and then appear on the phone. What? That is the most absurd crap ever. Why not just emojis living in a city do their thing, why make them be in a phone because we already no they are just data and not creatures living in our phone. Well, one emoji, the 'meh' emoji cannot do 'meh', he can apparently do everything which gets him in trouble with smiley face and soon he is being hunted because the kid whose phone they are on is going to delete his phone. So 'meh' must try to become 'meh' with the help of high five and a hacker. And the studio put money behind this. There are a couple of funny parts to this one, but seriously, it just is not a good film. Studios these days pass by good stories every day for something like this and who can blame them? People pass up films unless it is tied to something these days or a sequel. Seriously, they are making Star Wars films every year now and people get excited to see them. Why not make a film about something that can easily be turned into a toy? Thankfully, this film was not a huge super success, still wondering how the hell this cost 50 million to make. Unfortunately, it did make the studio a profit so I can see a direct to DVD or Netflix sequel coming out. I am sure if there is one it will be even more 'meh'.",Negative
440,"I know this is supposed to be targeted to kids, but was dragged to see this movie. This is really what happens when Hollywood cannot come up with new ideas for a movie, consider this a throwaway movie. The voice acting was not great and there really wasn't a plot to follow.

I am full disappointed of what society we live in.In this 1 hour and 31 minutes ""movie"", there is no comedy, everything is predictable, there is NOTHING interesting about this catastrophic failure.If you have 1 hour and 31 minutes that you can waste, please don't waste them on this movie, it's not worth it, you could watch a better movie, spend some time with your friends or family, probably even play a game like Chess or Backgammon, it may be boring, but it's at least entertaining.",Negative

445,"Let me tell anyone who reads this why this movie is the worst:(even though I haven't seen it but I've heard about it.)The Name of This Movie: Unoriginal, uninspired, and can already tell the viewer(s) that it is a futile attempt at pandering to this generation Animation: The only about this movie than isn't bland and/or awful is the animation. Just because it looks okay doesn't make it any better. Plot: The plot of this movie has been done to death and is similar to beating a dead horse. (The plot is that everyone is normal except for one guy who is different and that makes him ""weird"", so he possibly goes on a journey to become normal and at the end, he realizes that being different is what makes him special.) There are so many other movies that do this plot and handle it much better than this ""movie"" does. (for example, Wreck It Ralph)Product Placements: There are so many product placements (for example, Candy Crush, Facebook, Twitter, Just Dance, Dropbox, Spotify, etc.) that it's intrusive and a cheap series of attempts at capitalizing on the audience that uses these apps. In other words, the ludicrous amount of product placements makes this film The Advertisement Movie. (as I like to call it.)The Characters: The characters (as far as I know) are bland and don't really get any character development at all. The hacker emoji character is a rip-off of the character Wyldstyle from The Lego Movie, which is much better than this waste of money.Conclusion: Do not watch this film, you would be better off spending your money on any other movie that is not this one. Do not watch this movie, all it will do at most is that it might keep the children awake but even the children will probably get bored and ask to leave the theater and go back home. In other words, anyone who reads this review (and even those who don't read it) would be better off watching paint dry for about 90 minutes and giving their $10 (or so) to charity.Final Review Score: 0 out of 10 (if it was possible to give it a 0 on this site.)",Negative

If so, the emoji movie is for you. I cannot say enough bad things about the emoji movie. It is not a real film, provides no entertainment, and is not a worthwhile use of your time. Anybody's time. Sony should apologize for having released this ""movie"" and give refunds of 150% to all who are unfortunate enough to have seen it. This movie blights out world, and makes it a worse place to live, raise a family, and conduct a normal life. The emoji movie is the worst thing that has even happened to human society. Do not go see the emoji movie. They do not deserve your money.

The only positive thing I can say about it is the animation. It's actually quite nice to look at.All in all it's bad. I know 2/10 is brutal, but I did actually think about giving it a 4/10 for a majority of this movie, however then there were two scenes that just baffled me in how bad they were. I would not recommend this to anyone, but I think it's watchable for very very young kids.2/10",Negative
450,"I agree that this film was not good. Not because of bad writing, animation, voice rendered, but the timing of the film coming out mattered. If this same film was released before 'Wreck it Ralf', 'The Lego Movie', 'Pixels', 'Inside Out', then people might have liked it. But now, it is like Sony desperately wanted their version of toys and/or games related film, so they made it. That's how it looks like. Despite all the criticism, the film minted good sum. So it is not a box office flop, only devalued honestly by those who saw it.Those titles I mentioned and this story has the same storyline. Basically, that's very common platform where 80 per cent of the films borrow from. The scenes looked very ordinary, like there's nothing much to explore. The jokes were weaker, the characters were uninteresting in most of the parts. I would say they did not utilise them rightly. The good thing is, it is a watchable film, but the majority won't like it. Usually Sony animations were met with underwhelmingly, and seeing the response it had got, surely there will be no sequel, at least for now.3/10",Negative

A lower score than Norm of the north, Foodfight etc. OK time for the review, I saw this movie the other day and it was really meh and boring. The jokes were not funny and some of them felt like they were trying to be funny but failing miserably, I did smile or chuckle at a few. There were only 3 jokes in the movie that made me laugh but most of the times I laughed was with me and my friend making jokes about the movie that were funnier than the movie itself. I don't get why this movie exists, Emoji's aren't relevant anymore, It try's to appeal to the ""younger"" audience by using Emoji's but look at the gross of the movie and you can see they failed. There was literally no one else in the theater so Sony messed up big time. It also felt extremely similar to the Lego movie (which is a amazing movie) I mean there were robots trying who look the exact same trying to kill the main characters, and the character Wlydstyle and Jailbreak look exactly the Same!! WHAT THE HECK SONY. Sony you canceled Popeye for this! I cant believe you Sony",Negative
452,"*** This movie has gender politics *** Despite the shocking ratings for this movie, it's actually better than the other children's release at the moment (which also suffers from gender politics), the Ninjago Movie. Who is pushing sexism on young children? Why is it always one sided sexism? The Ninjago movie lacked heart. The Emoji movie has heart (especially due to T. J. Miller's performance). You end up liking most of the characters. However, the story is very predictable and leaves little to the imagination. This is what separates this movie from a Pixar movie. Pixar movies have heart and brains.If you really have to pick a movie for the holiday season for your children, get out an old movie so you don't have to deal with the gender politics (""why are men always taking credit for what women do"" type of garbage). If you're desperate for a cinema experience, pick the Emoji movie.",Negative
453,"When the trailer came out, I too fell victim to the hate train hype this movie was building. Is the movie good? No. Is it the worst thing ever? Probably not. I understand the hate this is getting, seeing how absurd the subject matter is. In execution it is less bad than it is just generic and forgettable. Many people thought this would be a so bad it's good flick. It's not bad enough to pull that off. It's also not bad enough to be insulting and painful to watch. It really is just a generic kid's film. In my experience, the movie went by pretty quickly, and I never really felt too bored or offended. Once the hate hype dies down, no one will remember this film.",Negative
454,"This review for The Emoji Movie is spoiler free* (1/5) ""THE MOST IMPORTANT form of communication are emojis,"" narrates T.J. Miller's Gene towards the start of The Emoji Movie is just one of the messages that can be found throughout Sony Pictures' cash cow scheme to bring in more money from a bad movie, which of course with the title Emoji Movie what's more to expect? Yes, this is the worst animated feature of the year for mainly one reason is that animations can be seen as the most creative form of film, however the idea to have multiple facial expression as the protagonists is possibly the laziest from of creativity. The Emoji Movie opens with Gene a multi-expressional Emoji who can change his expression by the flick of his face; his quest is to be placed on the screen for his user. He lives with other Emojis in Textville a world filled with different faces and emotions. The plot is essentially that Gene is fired from Textville's message board called The Cube, so he sets out on a quest to become a normal Emoji. That's pretty much it. Is there more to having a multi-expressional Emoji who tries to become normal? Of course, because for that it would have to follow logic and, from the off there is no logic here. There are many references to other, better forms of communication which of course our characters travel through in order to get to Cloud through Dropbox it's a continuous spiral of references and piling bad puns which can be seen from a mile away and will have you shacking your head. At its best the animation colourful (though mostly yellow) and brings all these emojis to full colour – even this deviates between cheap rubbery animation techniques to knock-off Pixar. There is even a short before the film based on Sony's own Hotel Transylvania in a vague attempt to follow Pixar success. In terms of cast, choosing T.J. Miller as Gene isn't a bad choice as he delivers some perhaps extended charm to the feature. With him there is a wide variety of different voices to hear firstly there's, Smiler (Maya Rudolph), Jailbreak (Anna Faris) a hacker, Hi-5 (James Corden), Mel Meh (Steven Wright),and finally there's Poop (Patrick Stewart) – though these are clever casting choices they are given nothing funny to say, in fact most of the things they do say is piled on by bad puns – ""I'm always smiling"" Smiler says at one point which makes this become lazy and incoherent to follow (in case you tried). In short, The Emoji Movie is a faithless; a zestless boilerplate animation which fails in many accesses of its audience and deserves a huge thumb down. VERDICT: An annoying, zestless, tasteless and boring animation which comes with lazy themes and tropes, abandon all hope ye who enter here.",Negative
455,Best movie ever to exist. Watch this before you decide to hate it.,Negative
456,"It's no surprise to me that, in today's world, The Emoji Movie is a film that actually exists. Emojis are everywhere thanks to the dependence of smartphones to communicate and it won't be long until it overtakes Chinese, Spanish and English as the most common spoken language in the world. That's not even possible by the way but they'll find a way.Gene (T. J. Miller), a multi-expressional emoji, sets out on a journey to become a normal emoji. There's a little bit more to the plot however, it's not even worth delving further into what this is actually about.Anyone who's ever used a smartphone will be able to tell you that there can be some fun had in using emojis to express yourself, whether it be in an innocent or rude manner. Is it fun to sit through a ninety-minute film about emojis though? The answer is a resounding no.The Emoji Movie is just an excuse for blatant product placement and a chance to make incredibly irrelevant references to popular culture, the Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen song playing as they enter the YouTube app making me want to scream in anger. It's full of insanely annoying characters too, James Corden's Hi-5 being like a turd that just won't flush. You think he's gone but then he makes a very unwanted return.The product as a whole, whether it be the unimaginative animation or the uninspired vocal performances, is void of any likability factor and the fact that I didn't hear one child laugh throughout speaks volumes. Animated films have come on leaps and bounds when it comes to conveying a message to the audience, but not The Emoji Movie. One of the only messages I took from this film was that boys should talk to girls via emojis prior to any form of human interaction. F**k my life.The Emoji Movie is as bad as I thought it'd be and then some. Avoid at all costs.",Negative

It's a pretty formulated movie about an emoji who does not just want to be one thing and goes on a journey though a kid's phone to prevent from getting deleted for being able to do multiple faces. The movie is somewhat satire on social media apps and how we communicate with one another these days ( I did like one part in which a teacher is teaching kids about hieroglyphics, the original emojis). All the big names like face book and Instagram make an appearance in the film. There were a few big laughs in the movie. It's one of those things where there making fun of one of the apps and if you use that app or understand how it's used than it will give you a chuckle, but man it's so funny how the film is as lackluster as the emoji they picked as the main character.

No. A poop emoji is not offensive. This story stars the emoji misfits Meh, High Five & Hacker on their quest to have lives, and to save themselves from being deleted from the smart phone. They fight against Smiler, who runs the emoji's with an iron ""smile"", trollers, and malware bots.

Kids movies that didn't seem like it wasn't checked enough, and movies that had actual effort put into it. The emoji movie does not have any effort put into it, and even someone who is very young can tell that most of the jokes in the emoji movie are lazy and stupid, and the plot is laughable, not to mention it's basically an advert you have to pay for.

However, it seems as if Sony is following the same corporate rabbit hole as 'Dreamworks Animation', creating quick cash grabs for a safe and significant profit. This is a very poor business route for Sony and will, in the long run, damage their reputation as if it was not low enough.The only possible ways I could see future films like this rising from hell would be from other heartless corporations sponsoring this horrible business practice.

469,"Since its release in the summer of 2017, The Emoji movie seemed to have caused some sort of uproar from people causing many people to bash it and claiming it as the worst movie ever. A lot of that is highly overreactions. I had little to no expectations considering knowing how low its reviews were and knowing some about the basic of the film.With that said, although the movie is predictable and has a story which has been done before (lead character doesn't feel he belongs, so he sets out on a journey for some kind of redemption, meets a love interest along the way, ends in a happy ending), this is a children's film and for the younger crowd, and since they are familiar with these emojis, it's best not to take the film too serious.Overall, the emoji movie isn't nearly as bad as critics and people are claiming, no it's not a great masterpiece but the visuals and colors are nice looking, and there are some creative product placement. Also the film isn't nearly that long to completely drag on. This movie also made quite a lot at the box office ($217 million worldwide), so people must have enjoyed it to some degree.",Negative

I understand why the ratings are so low, not everyone is capable of truly understanding a film as metaphorical and nuanced as this. It isn't your fault if you couldn't comprehend what Tony Leondis was trying to do, but I do hope you begin unpacking your preconceived biases that make you unable to fully understand and enjoy hard hitting queer films like this. Sony truly made history by giving us such a realistic and heartwarming depiction of gender fluidity, and it's obvious that this is something close to their heart as shown by their more recent movie ""The Mitchells vs. The Machines"" which features a lesbian main character. Sony is taking it upon themselves to bring us the important queer films that other animation studios are too scared to make, it's extremely inspiring. I hope any of you that thought The Emoji Movie was simply a lazy attempt at making money by taking something extremely prevalent in our society (emojis) and throwing in some poop jokes - will try watching it a few more times. Me and my peers regularly get together just to rewatch The Emoji Movie, taking in all the details, oftentimes making lists of new things we didn't notice before - and then we discuss it together, sharing our revelations and the new lesson we've learned (because no matter how many times we watch it - The Emoji Movie somehow manages to teach us something new each time).

491,I don't agree with the reviews on this movie at all and neither does my 9 year old daughter. I loved the story line as well as the animation. I work in the cell phone industry and so felt especially attached to the concept. Liked that it brought this element of technology to life!!,Negative
492,"If cancerous memes were a film, this would be that film. Harambe, Bad Luck Brian, and that ""ermahgerd"" girl wouldn't look out of place in this film, because all it is, and could realistically ever be, is an attempt at ""relatability"" and absolute filthy pandering to a younger audience than those who could possibly understand a hidden agenda.I'm pretty sure this film is a blockbuster classic in another universe, one where Trump is a good man, and Obama was born in Kenya. That's right, ""Opposite Universe"", which is ironically a film I would rather watch than this crock of meme-dust.I needed to take 3 scalding acid showers to forget this film, and this review will cause me to take a couple more.Ew.",Negative

If historians ever look back to our times, they will probably pin the beginning of our demise to this dreadful movie.",Negative
494,"This is by far the worst animated film i have ever seen, the plot may sound familiar because we have seen it in the Lego Movies, Minions and pretty much any other recent film about using brands to make easy money.Remember when making animated movies was all about moral lessons and making the audience have fun? well, this movie is just another strategy for making profit by just using a silly trend. Of course they don't give a damn about the quality, the story or the characters, they only made it because EMOJI is a word that sells and you can notice when they can't shut up about advertising Dropbox, Just Dance and other apps in the movie, you pretty much are PAYING to see a 90 minute add.Hey Sony, what's next?, The MEME movie? a movie with exactly the same plot as any other garbage animated film but with all memes having fun together?, the main character will be misunderstood and trying to find it's way into the society of memes? all with different emotions and feeling that represent each meme (the good one, the evil one, the sarcastic one, the funny one)?, with the ending being about the main character being accepted by everyone?",Negative
495,"I personally think that if a movie from leftists or right-wingers comes up with their dumb propaganda, they deserve a review from us Centrists more than the others. I reviewed Supergirl before, might wanna check out that review to know what to expect in this movie as well.This movie is awful. Ugly looking Emoji characters (and yes, they are ugly looking in apps too) bought to life with barren, featureless personality. In-fact, the only slightly funny character is the ""High Five"", a side-kick for the generic Hollywood protagonist and the generic ""SUPER TOUGH KICKS ASS"" female character.Ignoring the ugly CGI characters, if you just focus on the characters, they are just.. bland. I don't even know how to describe the damn thing because it's just so boring and stupid that there is so much to criticize and I can't be arsed with doing it again.Let's just finish the review with a list of feminist/liberal/leftists propaganda included in the movie, shall we? 1.) Hero is a metro sexual male who wants to express his feelings.2.) Female is a tough as nails chick who only likes cool things. Oh and she is a supercool hacker fighting the patriarchy.3.) Both male characters (Hero and side-kick, High Five) scream and yell like little girls when the female character does things like water slide or fall. Female character is always laughing and brave in these scenes of course.4.) Female character likes the male for being so expressive, unlike the ""other"" guys.5.) Female character thinks women are portrayed as only princesses and wants to be more. Wants to be someone else. Meanwhile, hero wants the same but she tells him to ""be who he is"" and not change a thing.6.) Sh*t dance sequence when the movie ends.This is like they took advice from whoever directs Supergirl on how to make the most ""liberal"" piece of garbage they could. And again, like Supergirl, I would've ignored their propaganda if rest of the content was actually good. And why the hell is there Patrick Stewart in this movie?",Negative
496,"Like virtually everyone is saying, this movie is terrible. I cannot put into words how bad it is. How anyone with the intelligence of a pebble can give it a 10-star rating is mind-boggling. The humor is horrible, the animation is mediocre at best and the writing is almost as bad as Norm of the North!

499,So first of all I went to see this so called movie and I was trying to get in to another movie IT but it backfired and I wasted 1 hour and 30 minutes of my life which I will not get back and it is lazy unoriginal but who made it Sony so what do you expect and when i went in to the movie it was hard to find a seat and I said to myself am I in the right movie and through out the whole movie I did not hear one single laugh and 95 percent was children so this is some of the story there is a emoji called meh and he can't be it because he is a malfunction and when he is about to get used he can't and freaks out and destroys the whole emoji box whatever and James gorden really gets on my nerves his voice is so irritating and this is about a boy I can't even remember his name it was so bad and he keeps getting embarrassed because his phone is controlling itself and he likes this girl but he doesn't have the confidence to talk to her and in the end the emoji turns into multiple emojis and she thinks it's cool like what is the plot to this movie oh yeah there is none I would not recommend this movie at all,Negative

505,"It's not a terrible film as everyone says. It's not good either but it's not terrible. I actually borrowed the film from a friend of mine and a few weeks later they played it on Netflix...go figure. I really only watched it because I wanted to see if it really is the worst film of the year and honestly it's not. Like I said it's not a great film, it has it's cute moment but I wouldn't declare it the worst film of 2017 that goes to Mother! which you can read my review of that but let's not open that can of worms please. 
 The film is about this emoji who is a Meh who only job is to go meh when someone hits his emoji but he has all these other emojis that he can't keep straight so it effect his job and his boss wants to terminate him before he corrupt the entire work force. Basically the Meh emoji enlist his friends to help him from being deleted. Okay now that we have our pilot of the film let me tell you what I thought of the film a bit more. It was cute. I will admit I did like the message of the film to be yourself and not just stick to what you normally do. Branch out and be you. The Candy Crush part was pretty cute because I play that game so I enjoyed that scene but the dancing game to get to the next stage was a bit too predictable for my taste. 
 Should you watch this film? Well I guess if you have small kids they'll find it enjoyable and with today teenagers they'll understand the emojis because they have these smartphones with all the emojis from the film. I think they should pass a law that no kid under the age of 10 should own a cellphone! Kids are too wrapped up into their phones these days. My niece is 9 and she has a cellphone why? These kids ain't got nobody to call at that age except maybe their parents. It's silly if you ask me. So I suppose if you want to view it and see for yourself if you think it's the so called worst film of 2017 but I personality wouldn't view it again unless I have to. If I am forced to watch it again I'll remember to bring my book so at least I'll get some reading done.",Negative

509,"The Emoji movie its a big joke in the internet, I wish it was just that, an ironic joke made to satirize Hollywood's worst aspects, but no, The Emoji movie is a real movie, and while cash grabs have been present in the past this one got an incredible amount of attention, I guess people just needed something to laugh at seeing how absurd the concept is.I was really annoyed by this movie, every other line was painfully unfunny, there is not one original aspect in it, it rips off many elements from different animated films but doesn't know why they worked, so just decides to copy for no real reason. Every awful cliché from almost any other animated movie is present here, even clichés that could be considered the weakest parts of good animated films, at least those movies had other redeeming qualities, this one lacks any kind of positive aspect.I do believe that this is the worst of Hollywood, the cynical product placement (The whole movie is one), the awful politics it tries to shove down people's throats, the predictable story, the usual character archetypes we see every time and the evident disconnect it has from its target audience. I don't hate Hollywod but this is one movie not even I would defend.",Negative
510,"This movie had so much talent but was a huge letdown to me as a somewhat expected it to be better with Maya Rudolph. It's okay for little kids but anyone over 7 most likely would be bored. Overall, this movie could've been better, and it really sucked",Negative

516,"Having been released in the U.S. a few months ago to a critical mauling, I intended to avoid this animated abomination at all costs. My 7 y.o. daughter, however, had other ideas. Following Gene (T.J. Miller), a malfunctioning 'meh' emoji who can't control his vast range of emotions, we enter the working world of a smartphone whereby every tap of the screen requires a functioning digital population to make it happen. In a universe where everyone (everything?) has its place, Gene is ridiculed for his expressiveness and, after sending out the wrong emoji for his user (Alex, a teenage boy in the midst of his first romance), must go on the run from the delete-happy Smiler (Maya Rudolph). Ostensibly an adventure comedy, there is neither enough thrills to make it exciting or enough laughs to make it amusing; ironically falling into a zone of complete meh-ness. The jokes about twitter, internet trolls and the controlling nature of smartphones in modern society would have been astute a few years ago, in 2017 they're already out-dated and tired. And the target audience for this film wont understand them anyway. Thankfully there are some hilarious visual gags like the poop emoji exiting the toilet oh wait, nope, even that is old and boring, barely getting a titter from the packed cinema of kids (and parents regretting their choice) ready to laugh at just about anything. The animation is unsurprisingly bright and James Corden's sidekick Hi-5 adds a smidge of delight, however The Emoji Movie ultimately has less flavour and value-for-money than the watered-down soft drink and over-priced popcorn from the cinema's candy bar.",Negative
517,"I went to see this movie with my 7-year-old sister. She really enjoyed it! It's the first movie she saw this year where she wanted to stay until the end. I don't know why it's been so harshly criticised; it's lighthearted and funny. I would definitely recommend it for children; they don't analyse the plot like they are some Darth Vader critics. I must say I enjoyed it as well. For anyone who watches it, I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!",Negative
518,"There's a lot of hate on this movie and some is not entirely without merit. Actually one of the 1 star reviewer almost got to me, until he mentioned Angry Birds (arguable) but especially the Lego movies. You can't put those in the same bin as this. The Lego movies especially really have a quality to them that speaks to both adults and children. Something this movie does not have.But is it like a disease as some have suggested? I'd say not. I do get the corporate idea thing, that they try to shove into our brain. Let's keep it real though: that always existed. And this movie tries to bank on that. It doesn't really succeed and while it tries to copy a couple of things Pixar and other animated movies did, it never reaches that quality. Having said that, I've seen worse ... and I know that is not an ""excuse"" for some, concerning my rating, but it's the truth.",Negative
519,"...but fails to deliver.Ever since I've seen the trailer for this movie, I've been looking forward to seeing it. The trailer promised so much, but in the end, it was one of those movies that had all the best bits shown in the trailer.The concept for the movie is original and I was expecting the narrative to be another Despicable Me, The Lego Movie, or Wreck It Ralph, level quality. Unfortunately from this reviewer's point of view, it wasn't.The movie has good moments, but they were far and few between to save it from its lowly rating.I tried to like this movie, but with characters that failed to connect with me, and too many try-hard moments, it just disappointed.Anyone older than 12 will probably find this movie tedious.",Negative
520,"Maybe it's a symptom of lockdown, but watch a film as shallow and empty as this and find still find some joy.The film is not subtle nor smart in anyway. Its product placement is in your face and the characters are 1 dimensional. It is clear that people thought the premise was enough to make the film work and they didn't need to bother with plot, drama or decent jokes.But i still found it just about watchable, which is probably due to the amount of utter rubbish I have already watched in the last year.",Negative

Voice cast is only thing that is OK and high rated( T. J. Miller, James Corden, Anna Faris...) Plot?Not so bad if you ask me.Very straight forward,for kids.I will not talk about it for no making spoilers. Characters?Flat as emoji.

I think the stars rating shows all. regards",Negative
526,"This could have been something enjoyable, but it fails to generate any interest. T.J. Miller I always find entertaining, but his voice over character is not giving much of any interest, neither does any of the animated characters. You really don't get infested into there doing. Trying to hard to be another Wreck-it Ralph(2012), and you can see how hard it was trying.Now the animation is pretty to look at, showing life inside an IPhone. But if that's all the movie has going for it. Only children can be forgiving of this, but adults not so much.",Negative
527,"This movie is so ""bad"" that, philosophically, it starts to make you question what makes a ""bad"" movie, and what the different types of bad are. This movie is probably bad in the worst way possible - it's empty and soulless. This isn't art. This isn't something that tried and missed it's mark. It's a manufactured product using a store-bought just-add-water story. It's the cinematic equivalent of a TV dinner. Now, TV dinners are edible but are they really nourishing? This movie isn't a ""failure"". The story is fine and complete. But it's soulless.",Negative

Now Gene has to try and flee from the robots that are trying to delete him.T.J. Miller plays the voice of Gene and he is absolutely horrible in the movie. Every performance is so bad and I cannot believe that this is a real movie. The screen time is 86 minutes but it feels more like 3 hours. I was not invested in the story at all and of course to make it worse there are two dance sequences in the movie. The animation is flat and boring and has no originality to it.This movie is one of the worst of the year and it is probably the worst animation movie ever made. Don't waste your time on this movie. If I could erase my memory of this movie I absolutely would so just don't watch it I beg you. A movie that is created by some producers with only wanting to make money. DON'T WATCH THIS!!!",Negative

531,"Colourful, bright with lovely animation. The story is decent, fairly cliché kids movie, younger kids will probably love it, less so for older kids. The product placement is very, very heavy handed and conspicuous and it's meme attempts are laughably bad. Kids are unlikely to notice, but there's some 'so bad it's good' novelty for the older viewers. Overall it has okay character and message, that even adults can quite enjoy and get somewhat immersed in. It's overall, very OK. I would rate 5 star if it wasn't so ridiculously full of product placement and their 'strong female character' is quite forced. (Seriously, strong women don't need to constantly reassert how strong and independent they are...) The message of this movie? USE DROPBOX PLAY CANDY CRUSH AND DDR AND DID YOU KNOW DROPBOX IS SECURE? Oh, and be yourself and accept everyone for who they are. Gene, the main character is a 'meh emoji, and that reflects the movie. It's just meh.",Negative
532,"The lack of pacing and an absolute absence of plot depth made watching this a tiring exercise of patience. When I wasn't cringing at the stupidly unfunny jokes and product placement, I found myself rolling my eyes at the ridiculously predictable dialogue.

This movie was bad, like that other movie that came out in 2016 and we all knew would suck and when it came out sucked (ghostbusters anyone?). Nobody was surprised that this sucks, nobody was sitting slack jawed in the theater going ""OH MY GOD THIS LOOKED SO GOOD IN THE TRAILERS"" if you want to see the movie, just watch the trailers, because honestly that's all you need to see. The characters are basically described with one phrase, Jean is the ""special one,"" Jailbreak is ""the strong female character "" and high five is the "" ""comic"" relief."" None of this movie is original, none of this movie is good. It is just a blatant cash grab from a terrible company who has no clue what anyone is interested in these days.

Not entertaining at all. However it's much doing that was a lot more fun that watching this waste of time. No I did not walk of the theater (although I felt like doing it), I had to this atrocity until the end. I gave the Emoji Movie a chance and I regretted it, HARD. It's wonderful background and animation however might be one of the only advantages about the film. The scenery and visuals are stunning in all seriousness. The Emoji Movie offers very little entertainment, it's original and it's a waste of time. Save your money instead of going out to see this garbage. I'll just keep playing with my fidget spinner.

Unfortunately, this method never deemed sufficient, as they would still repeat their actions. However, when my youngest, Timmy, called my oldest, Todd, a ""stinky pile of bologna"", I knew what I had to do.

There is not one second of consideration put into any frame of this film. Every character is bland, every design is generic, every joke and plot thread is predictable.It's a desperate and I do mean desperate attempt to capitalize on a growing and recent trend. It's a money-grabber to say the least. You take a subject popular with young kids, you get paid by a bunch of different companies to display their terrible apps in the movie, etc, etc. This movie had no passion. Movies are made to make money but they are typically a labour of love.

Randomly I saw it on Netflix, so I figured it can't hurt actually to watch it.Yes. It did hurt, this movie is beyond bad and deserves its awards for being bad.The only possible good part of this movie lies with the character designs. Everything else is terrible beyond belief. It's not even possible for me to describe every single bad thing in this movie.To only address some of the flaws:
Story holes
Lack of explanations
Wrong emotions in various scenes
Some propaganda

551,"The Emoji Movie is an exciting adventure with memorable characters and complete with hilarious jokes and clever themes! Oh... sorry... that's what you WISH it was. This movie is so unbelievably terrible that Sony had to put SO much effort into Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse just to make up for this piece of Sir Patrick Stewart, who, by the way, plays a poop emoji. That's pretty much the movie in a nutshell. But if you want a more extensive answer, the movie is, boring, the characters are, forgettable, the script is, awful, the jokes are, cringe-worthy, the premise is, beyond stupid, the animation is, just OK, and the less I say about the bucket-load of product placement, the better. This may just be the worst animated movie of all time.",Negative
552,"The Emoji Movie is poorly written and the jokes are unfunny. This doesn't deserve to be a masterpiece out of almost every single animated movie. I don't really recommend watching this pile of trash because of how stupid, how unfunny, how boring, and how unenjoyable it is. Plot kinda lacks about why this movie is about emojis, and somehow the movie plagarized ideas from other movies I liked, such as The LEGO Movie, Wreck it Ralph, and Inside Out. Basically I'll explain more here. So basically about Gene and his friends setting his journey to go on an app adventures? That literally doesn't pretty mean about why this movie is about emojis. In the other hand, Jailbreak, the tritagonist of the movie, is nothing but a ripoff of Wyldstyle from The LEGO Movie. Smiler, the antagonist of the movie, her design makes it an uncanny valley to it, making it pretty creepy. The story itself, is really boring and unenjoyable. In the other hand, really bland and confusing to understand about (especially bland and confusing about why this movie is about emojis). So there you have it, The Emoji Movie is what people definitely didn't enjoy and ask for.Overall, this movie deserves to get a D-Movies like The LEGO Movie, Wreck it Ralph, Inside Out, Spider-verse, the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie coming out in April 7, 2023, and Smurfs: The Lost Village (the Sony pictures animation film that preceded this trash movie, even though this doesn't mean I hate this Smurfs movie) are better in general than this piece of coal.",Negative

554,This movie was embarrassing to watch especially because of James Cordon I will be talking a lot about him because he is my nemesis even though he does not know me. His voice acting in this movie was squeaky and embarrassing. His acting and voice acting and horrible tv show should be studied in a lab because it should be considered toxic waste. He thinks he is funny because he has those dumb car music thingys were he gets be lost celebrities on most of them and they sings songs that were only famous 2 years ago. Shame on you James Cordon.

557,"I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as bad as many people made it out to be.It has all the ingredients of a good movie, but misses the mark when it comes to delivery. It's like it just didn't manage to reach what Sony was hoping for, but their concepts and ideas around life on the phone was actually very well thought out.This movie does NOT deserve the hate it gets - not by a long shot, but it's also not one I would recommend, because it didn't reach what it was aiming for. Definitely a missed opportunity.If you're curious and wanna check it out - at worst, you'd be a bored. At best, you'll find that you actually like it and some of the humor in it somewhat.Not a recommend, but not an avoid either.",Negative
558,"It has become a meme of how bad this movie is. After watching it I feel that it was not so bad.
The movie is basically Wreck-it Ralph meets Inside-Out. Those movies are hardly masterpieces to begin with, and to me their biggest quality was their high-concept premise. Wreck-it Ralph is already an adaptation of Toy Story but with video games and Inside Out is too transparent with its emotional arcs.
Anyway, that leaves us with a movie that does not have an original premise, does not have a visually unique aesthetic and has a very linear story. Yet, I did not hate this film. Is it boring? Yes definitely, but mostly because a lot of what it does I have already seen before. However, for younger audiences that have not seen a lot of movie this might not be an issue.Other than that, the movie suffers from flaws that are independent from the movie itself. These are problems that affect larger movies, and that have nothing to do with the story or the way it is told. For instance, the fact that every character is voiced by a celebrity. The omnipresent use of product placement or references to real life brands. It distracted me constantly. These things are not necessarily bad, and if you don't know what Dropbox or Spotify is, then you're fine. But for me, it made it harder to invest myself in the movie's universe. You cannot get lost if everything you see is recognisable.A positive thing that I will give the movie credit for, is that it makes good use of the emojis themselves. There is enough variety to make it interesting, even if it is not particularly inspired. (in other words it is rather ""meh"" (I'm so sorry))
Visually, the animations are well done. Technically the film holds up. That is why I do not understand the sheer hate this movie gets. It might be lazy sure, but it is not necessarily incompetent.That being said there was one sequence that irked me a little, when James Corden declares ""you don't need real friends but you only need fans that give you unrelenting support as long as you are on top"". This sequence, which revolves around being an ad for Facebook, goes totally unchallenged by the characters or the narrative, and it is rather strange message for a movie aimed at kids that might not grasp all the nuances and caveats of social media.Overall, the movie is heavily flawed and uninspired. Yet, I don't feel that it is dramatically different from any other modern children oriented animated movies. When compared to Wreck-it Ralph or Inside-Out, the former is saved by its love for video games and the latter works on the human story level, not so much on the heavy-handed metaphor. The emojis are not an old tradition with a passionate subculture and the over-arching story of the teen getting his phone wiped is not especially riveting. But there is fancy colours.",Negative

560,"Yes, the rumors of how bad it is are quite true. But look. Everybody makes mistakes from time to time, and this was one of the worst from the studio. Yeah, there were Smurf movies, but those just were made from greed. This one just feels like Battlefield Earth: made by a cult.The story is boring and steals plot elements from other better movies, the animation has some good qualities, but other cringy parts that take over, the voice acting sucks, the tone is obnoxious, and it's filled to the brim with PRODUCT PLACEMENT. I was waiting for a time when it would cut to a commercial midway or advertise mypillow in the middle of the film.

As he tries to become ""normal,"" he goes on a journey with other emojis like Hi-5 and a hacker emoji named Jailbreak.\:Animation quality: The visuals are clean and polished. Sony Pictures Animation is technically capable, and the digital environments are bright and colorful.Voice talent: The cast includes T. J. Miller, James Corden, Anna Faris, and Patrick Stewart (voicing the poop emoji), though their talent is mostly wasted here.Story: The narrative is generic and heavily derivative of better films It lacks originality and emotional depth.Characters: Most characters are one-dimensional, driven by clichés rather than genuine personality. Their development is shallow and unengaging.Product placement: The movie aggressively promotes real apps (e.g. Spotify, Dropbox, Candy Crush) in ways that feel forced and commercial rather than natural parts of the story.Tone and humor: Much of the humor is juvenile, relying on puns and emoji-related jokes that feel dated and uninspired even for a young audience.The message about self-acceptance is clumsily delivered, buried under a pile of digital metaphors that feel hollow.",Negative

572,"I rewatched the emoji movie and saw a world where emojis can live together in peace and harmony but can only be one not. I saw as the colorful CGI tantalized my eyes.The movie is about a kid who has a smartphone and he goes on it too much with all the other schoolies. He wants to rizz up a baddy but can't because he's an L rizz student. (t's so funny this movie he'd be 20 now). So what does he do? The boy gets his phone updated to have a new keyboard full new emojis. This is the stake in the movie because this mean total emoji death if he does so. Meh is seen as a fluke because he's multifaceted in his emotions.20 minutes in I realized something. There are inanimate objects that can emote but not emojis themselves. This doesn't make a lick of sense. But it's ok though because humans cannot see the emotions of those random object/animal emojis but shouldn't these? But why is it bad for emojis to express more than one emotion? This do not make sense big boy.Well I think very little kids will like it except they won't. I'm friends with a person who literally has holes in their brain and he doesn't like it. He likes bad movies like the Good Dinosaur. It's not that bad though.

Let's go over some points.Story- Literally every animated movie ever. Guy is bullied, he wants to change, he has opportunity to change, he realises he's good the way he is, everyone loves him after he saves the day.Characters- I have seen straight lines more 3-dimensional than any of these characters. It feels like they have 1 personality trait each.Animation- This is the only thing I will give the movie credit for, apart from a few slip-ups, the animation is actually decent.Soundtrack- They pretty much just take anything from the Top 10 on the radio. And it's all pop songs made for kids under the age of 10.Acting- Dreadful, they hired some random celebrities and cast Patrick Stewart as a poop emoji. The man who played Professor X in all of the X-men films is playing a poop emoji.All in all, don't watch this film if you don't want to subject yourself to pain.

For example, the character, Gene, is one of the best portrayals of a person with a problem of fitting in. Personally, this movie ranks up with ""Casablanca"".",Negative

579,"If cinema is a language, The Emoji Movie speaks in grunts and typos. This 2017 animated film attempts to surf the wave of smartphone culture, but instead belly flops into a sea of product placement, lazy writing, and cynical pandering.Set inside a teenager's phone (because apparently, that's where stories live now), the film follows Gene, a ""meh"" emoji who's just too expressive for his own good. It's a premise that could have explored identity or digital culture with some charm or depth. Instead, it offers an exhausting barrage of corporate cameos; from Candy Crush to Dropbox, as if the film were more interested in brand partnerships than making a story.The animation is competent, but sterile. Characters are uninspired both visually and emotionally, reduced to one-note caricatures based on whatever app or emoji they represent. The humor is low-effort and rarely lands, aiming squarely at the youngest of audiences but insulting even their intelligence. A poop joke voiced by Sir Patrick Stewart should be funny in theory. In practice, it just feels like a career dare.There's a faint attempt at a moral; something about being yourself, but it's buried under layers of buzzwords and bland storytelling. By the time the credits roll, you're left wondering not just why this movie was made, but why you watched it.The Emoji Movie isn't offensively bad, it's just depressingly mediocre. A 90-minute advertisement disguised as a film. Save your bandwidth and your money. Watch literally anything else.",Negative

Now, this is by far the most unoriginal movie ever - it's general plot, themes, and stuff are all stuff that we've seen time and time again.
It has some of the cheesiest lines in history (with Aquaman coming in a close second).
It is also extremely predictable.
But it has a talented cast who's voices are just perfect for their roles, great animation, and you know what? It doesn't hurt to hear the message that this movie showcases once again as it is actually relevant.
And while it is predictable it also is entertaining enough to keep you interested. Though, if you don't like the plot, give it a shot for the music. The music in it is fantastic, even if you don't like the plot.

The Emoji Movie (2017) takes elements of Wreck-It Ralph (2012), The Lego Movie (2014), and a dash of Inside Out (2015) and yet fails to recreate the magic that any of those other three films have. It's a movie that seems flawed from the very concept. This is a movie with jokes more geared towards children, but with a subject matter (tech, texting, social media) more geared towards teens and adults.The movie is just hollow and soulless, absolutely no heart to be found. All it ends up being is bland pop culture references followed by already aged poorly, product placement.Was the Emoji pop dance meant to be an attempt to create a viral trend? I hope not, what a tremendous failure. Speaking of which, who plays Just Dance on their phone? I could be wrong, but I've never heard of that.Apparently, this movie was the first shown in theaters in Saudi Arabia after a 35-year ban was lifted.

In 2017 alone, The Star and now The Emoji Movie headlines this studio's filmography, succumbing to new levels of BOGUS per offering. TSK.This Emoji Movie is bogged down by concepts that are absolutely pointless and even reaches levels of depressing. The universe the picture pushes for is DEJECTING, with lore that's centered around product placement over adventure, and character motivations that are excruciatingly shallow. Imagine a grand finale centered on Dropbox, consequential exploits around Candy Crush and Just Dance and character incentive to be Meh. MEH?! Also, its narrative that attempts at connecting real world drama to its fantastical beats comes off insanely weak and out of place, with coming of age messages that screams fakery. Its brand of humor is as well uninventive & bland, and with the absence of interesting characters, entertainment value isn't even this blunder's saving grace.Overall, The Emoji Movie has NO REASON TO EXIST. We do not need gimmicks around phones as it is impossible to create a captivating universe, centered on money-grabbing platforms. With this premise, it as well a challenge to believe storylines that boasts of upsides to real world connections. BOGUS!",Negative

Unfortunately, the film falls flat.The film's plot is shallow and predictable, lacking creative ideas and a compelling story to engage the audience. Instead, it feels like a marketing ploy to capitalize on the popularity of emojis.The characters are one-dimensional and clichéd, offering little development or opportunities for the audience to connect with them. The dialogue is uninspired and at times even frustrating, lacking genuine substance and originality.The animation in the film is technically competent, but that alone cannot compensate for the lack of quality and substance.

Even the talented voice cast, including T. J. Miller and James Corden, can't salvage the lackluster writing and character development. The jokes and gags are mostly cringe-worthy, relying heavily on outdated internet culture references that will leave most viewers scratching their heads.Visually, it's colorful and occasionally fun, but it doesn't make up for the movie's shortcomings. The attempt to turn smartphone apps and the digital world into a tangible universe falls flat, leaving the audience with a sense of disconnection rather than immersion.Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of ""The Emoji Movie"" is its transparent attempt to capitalize on the popularity of emojis and smartphones, making it feel like a shameless cash grab rather than a genuine attempt at storytelling. It's hard to shake the feeling that this movie was made solely to sell merchandise and capitalize on a trendy concept. First and foremost, the plot is as thin as the phone screen it's projected onto. We follow the adventures of Gene, a ""Meh"" emoji who can't quite conform to his one-dimensional role. The whole journey to become ""normal"" is as clichéd as they come, and it feels like a missed opportunity to explore more interesting themes in the digital age.The characters are as one-dimensional as the emojis themselves, lacking depth or relatability. Even the talented voice cast, including T. J. Miller and James Corden, can't salvage the lackluster writing and character development. The jokes and gags are mostly cringe-worthy, relying heavily on outdated internet culture references that will leave most viewers scratching their heads.Visually, it's colorful and occasionally fun, but it doesn't make up for the movie's shortcomings.

611,"I've never really been a big fan of Sony, except for Spider Man: Into the Spider Verse and the Spider Man franchise with Tom Holland as Spider Man. These ones are really good. But THIS? Not really.First, I don't like how the kids in this movie are portrayed as being only devoted to their phones. Many kids value more IMPORTANT things than phones and screens, like their education and their family. That stereotype is an insult to kids, and the kids who see that will not want to watch this. The plot and characters were very, very bland, (it IS about EMOJIS, after all), and the dialogue is just plain bad. This movie has been stuck in my head ever since I made the terrible mistake seeing this in theaters a few years ago. This movie is annoying and pointless. It has poor storytelling and is a mix of cliches from other movies. It's nothing but a cash grab advertisement and one of Sony's biggest mistakes yet.I haven't watched this for a long time, and I'm grateful. For all you lucky people who haven't seen this stupidity, then DON'T. The Emoji Movie is not worth your time at all. Don't even bother renting it.",Negative
612,"It's not the best but I feel like it's overhated. Although a lot of the aspects are heavily based around appealing to the youth and being trendy the movie as a whole wasn't that cringe. Some of the scenes were a little funny and smile is definitely one of the most entertaining characters in the movie. The story theme is somewhat generic basically being ""be yourself"". Giving emojis depth was probably a challenge but i think they did alright, though they could have done better for some characters. The comedy in the movie could have been better cause some of the jokes and puns are forced but the unintentional funny parts werethe best. The movie is very formulaic and does lack creativity in a lot of areas. It's definitely not 3/10 but 5.3/10 seems reasonable, if you enjoy 3d animation movies or like Pixar movies you'll like this movie. Edit: Hand emoji was probably the worst.",Negative
613,Nothing but a device to suck up all the new generation's money.,Negative

615,"There's really nothing to endear this movie to anyone. It's literally the same disaster as ""Hotdog Party"" and then some, with everyone except the dysfunctional ""Stepford Emoji"" leader worried about being deleted. If I add anything more it will probably end up being a spoiler, so I'll stop here. Not recommending it. Don't waste your spare change on this one.",Negative

617,"So this isn't a great movie..but it's a film about Emojis for kids so surely you can't go into it expecting an animated equivalent of Citizen Kane.For some reason my 5yr old likes this film so I have been subjected to it on a fairly regular basis. It's bright, it's colourful and a bit of fun. I don't think it's much worse than some of the other terrible films of a similar kind and if you just take it for what it is then it isn't that bad.It would appear the writers have been given the Emoji brief and have had to create what they can within this limited world. There are some decent lines in it and some interesting uses of the subject of smart phones. The voice over performances are decent and I'm sure if you look deep enough I'm sure there is a moral to the story.",Negative
618,"This is the most boring movie i have ever watched. Jokes were for 3 year olds, story was very stupid, characters were bland and lacking depth, the settings of the film were very unthoughtful, and half of the movie was pure cringe. Even the music was depressing. It's like the producers fell asleep on their jobs... They also clearly rushed it, yet they had years to make this movie. Marvel had the same time as them and how come they did a better job? This movie had only an hour and 20 minutes in screen time. That is basically a little less than half of a normal movie. It should be in the ""animated shorts"" section, to make sure nobody watches it. So if you want to waste a short amount of time making fun of a crappy of a movie, then do so. If not, dont waste your time, your eyes will bleed. Only watch it and make fun of it when you can watch it illegally on some Youtube channel before it gets shut down.",Negative
619,"I expected the movie to be actual garbage. I wanted the movie to suck, but it's actually not terrible. Of course it has its flaws, and the idea of the movie is kind of boring.

All in all i rate the movie 5 stars.",Negative

Man I watched this last year and this was so bad that I literally had to do a full on Instagram story like thing of me watching this movie and it took all of my strength to make it through this movie.Luckily, Sony made a better animated film in 2018 with ""Into the SpiderVerse"", a movie I wasn't even that excited for until I found out who was involved in it and later trailers and it was miles better than this.The only saving graces I have is the animation and the voice acting but my god, the product placement is OBNOXIOUS AS ALL KINDS OF HECK and this movie is so unoriginal, not funny, boring, lame and frustratingly awful. The Candy Crush thing? WHAT THE HECK WE'RE THE FILMMAKERS THINKING WHEN THEY WROTE THIS MOVIE OR PUT THIS INTO PRODUCTION?!!The only thing product placement wise that I didn't mind were YouTube and somewhat, Just Dance, but that isn't enough. And why is there a Star Trek reference in here? The only thing this got out of me was a few chuckles because I couldn't believe my eyes.If i had sat through this back in 2017, this would've made my worst films of the year.Grade: JD GOMFC (Get out of my face, Emoji Movie)THIS MADE MORE MONEY THAN BLADE RUNNER 2049!

623,"Sony has had some bad movies before but Jebus... The Emoji movie is the biggest slap in the face to millennials I have ever seen. This ""movie"" (if you could even call it that), is the downfall to 2017 and the world as we know it. The biggest cinematic flop in history is the Emoji movie. It was only created to make money by greedy, worthless, talent less imbeciles, and they succeeded all to well. Shameless product placement and 'trendy' voice actors worked. And to put the icing on this big stinking pile, it was marketed towards kids. The Emoji Movie may seem harmless enough, but when you take a closer look, its just a barbaric marketing scheme that worked out in Sony's favor. So whatever you do, DON'T TAKE YOU KIDS TO THIS GOD FORSAKEN, GARBAGE HEAP OF A FILM!",Negative
624,"I was dreading my kid wanting to watch this because I had heard how bad it was. I heard that it was so awful, the worst kids movie ever, unbearable, etc. I managed to let my son forget about it while it was theaters and felt like I had dogged a bullet. When it came out on Netflix, I begrudgingly let him watch it. It's not that bad! Really, it's not. Would I recommend it to my friends and their kids? Not in particular. Is it insightful and clever? No. But is it a terribly bad movie? Also no. Kids (about age 8 and under probably) will be entertained and adults may be mildly amused at a few of the jokes. Anna Farris was really cute as the Jailbreak character and High-Five, while slightly obnoxious at times, was actually pretty funny. The plot has a few logistical problems, but most all movies do. And it's a kids movie; they don't really care about that stuff. Their standards aren't that high. 
So overall, it's FINE. Doesn't deserve all the hate.",Negative

627,"It's not down right awful... just meh.For starters, yes, this movie is not good. Awful story followed by awful characters. The movie is always being dumb or stupid every 10 seconds that you can't help but laugh at how badly this can get.They also never use the concept of a phone great. A fire wall as an actual Fire Wall! Where does that fit?I don't hate it, it's still watchable for the first 15-20mins before it starts becoming unbearable. Adding in a forced romance?! Not every movie needs the main character falling in love with the girl character!Yes it's bad to meh. But, not as bad as some say, but still not good, + Very Cringy and Corny!",Negative
628,"I saw this in theaters once. Me and my dad thought it was okay from what I remember. I thought the hate might've been overexaggerated but I guess I was wrong. Personally, I think that Barbie (2023) was way worse than this. As the movie was more childish and that it is very overly peppy despite that movie has a PG-13 with a ridiculous premise.",Negative
629,"I wasn't expecting much when my daughter randomly put this on over the Christmas holiday, but good grief was this film derivative. The Emoji Movie follows the 'meh' emoji as he goes to his first day at work inside some kids phone. Thing is, he actually has the ability to be pretty much any emoji, and when he freaks out while the kid is texting, the kid thinks there is something wrong with his phone. Hence, the phone gets booked in for a service, and all the characters in the phone start freaking out, thinking they will all be deleted and reset. So its up to Meh to put things right...If that all sounds very, well, 'meh'... then congratulations - you have probably seen one of the many, many MANY similar animated movies with this identical plot arc. Guy causes issue endangering everyone so has to go on a quest of personal discovery to fix it. Meh. The whole film just felt specifically like an Inside Out ripoff, but worse in every way. I mean, even my 11yo daughter turned to me about 3/4 the way through and said ""this is a bit cr*p isn't it?"" Yes, yes it is. It is, in fact, fittingly, very 'meh' (ok I'll stop making that joke now). Just don't waste your time, there are hundreds of better animated films out there...",Negative
630,"Is the first animated Razzie Award winner The Emoji Movie the worst film of the year? Gene (T.J. Miller) is a 'meh' emoji inside a kid's iPhone who wants to be a wide variety of expressions. Once he accidentally glitches the phone, he crosses the threshold and exits Textropolis with his band of misfits Hi-5 (James Corden) and Jailbreak (Anna Faris), going through all sorts of Apps like CandyCrush, Just Dance, Spotify, and Dropbox, to escape from the bots hired by Smiler (Maya Rudolph). The obvious message in the film is that technology connects people together, so buy an iPhone and text an emoji to show your love for another. Hearing that flimsy and gimmicky moral, I saw The Emoji Movie as a 90-minute commercial for Sony products, with all the features installed such as a half-baked story, uninspired characters, and obnoxious puns, but colorful imaginative worlds. As for Alex, the phone's owner who sends a text to let go of his comfort zone, he is no Riley from Inside Out. The boy is just as dreadfully boring as all the other phone-ridden schoolmates, including his girl crush, and the apps and emojis don't do much to support his character arc. Also, the film missed an opportunity to have the emojis escape the phone world and enter the WiFi network, where they might accidentally damage the system causing chaos in not just the school but the world. This could have been a unique children's satire tackling the impact of technology among humans. However, The Emoji Movie and Sony exist to only advertise trendy electronics rather than glorifying the art of cinema. (1 ½ Thumbs Down Symbols out of 5)",Negative
631,Movie was enjoyable if your a 5 year old. James Corden deserves better than to play a thumb in a stupid movie that's for kids under 5. It wasn't God awful but it seemed like it would be a Nickelodeon movie that never went in the theaters. If I could describe it with one emoji. THUMB DOWN!,Negative
632,The idea behind this movie is just ridiculous. The execution was just worse and the humor was just terrible. Pls. Don't watch this movie and don't trust the 10 star reviews. It is not worth it and watching paint dry is way funner than watching this... thing.,Negative
633,"This film is a very, very bad film. The product placement on this film is straight up ridiculous. Also, the idea itself is terrible. How can you build a good and genuine world around EMOJIS??? Yeah, you can't, because they are so simple and generic, that it be pointless trying. Yet Sony tried, and obviously failed at trying. Also, the actual story itself is also really bad. It's also so forgettable that I already forgot what this movie was about. What I remember is that it's about this really badly structured main character, named Gene, who is supposedly to be a ""Meh"" emoji. But instead, he does a giant variety of emotions. That's all you need to know about the story, anyways, bye,",Negative

635,"The emoji movie is a feature length commercial literally about emojis. The ""film"" has even more product placement than an Adam sander film. The only positive about this movie was that the animation is actually pretty nice, but other from that don't waste your money on a commercial.

636,I rate this movie 10/10 because it destroys your brain cells and you will thoroughly enjoy. Best movie if you are looking to tarnish your sanity. Nobody likes this movie but it is amazing and definitely recommend to you and not kids unless you want them to be stupid for the rest of their live. Long story short watch this movie. Please.,Negative
637,"The only thing this movie truly has it going for is the (insultingly) beautiful animation. The visuals are stunning, everything is bright and colorful (for a kids movie, at least), and the emoji designs... are not really that bad.With that being said, watching this movie from start to finish was THOROUGHLY unenjoyable. The writing was some of the worst I've ever seen, the screenplay is horrible, the plot is bland & repetitive, the characters are annoying/forgettable, and the humor.. my god, the humor. The only, and I mean the ONLY times I've at least had a smile on my face was right at the beginning where we see that that the text emoticons are considered the elderly in their universe, and the Just Dance scene, as I love Just Dance. Also, what is with this movie and playing ""Feel This Moment"" by Pitbull and Christina Aguilera twice? I personally love the song but man, why couldn't they just pick a different song for the end?Overall, this movie really IS as bad as everyone said it was back in 2017. Don't show this to your kid(s). Show them Wreck-It-Ralph, The Lego Movie, or Inside Out instead. They'll have way more fun watching those movies instead of this boring mess.",Negative
638,"Excruciatingly bad. It's proper rubbish.Based on the reputation of this, I knew it was going to be utter tripe. I always wait to watch myself to form my own opinion, but there is no doubt about it - 'The Emoji Movie' is truly awful. It's such a lazy attempt, there is absolutely no creativity and there doesn't seem to have been that much care put into this. How about that product placement, also?!I will say I do like the idea, you could probably create a fine film with it. However, man did they get the execution incredibly wrong. That's also not good given the cast performances, all of which are quite pathetic. In fairness, they don't exactly get much to work with.I'm someone who likes James Corden, but he is terrible here. As is T.J. Miller, while Anna Faris and Maya Rudolph are forgettable. I was disappointed (sorta) not to see more of Patrick Stewart's character, given how much I've heard in recent years; he's barely in it.It's a painful watch, even with a run time of just 86 minutes.",Negative

643,I am not sure at all what the crew were doing or thinking when they were creating this animation film. This is such a bad animation film. Everything about it was bad and did not make any sense at all. The storyline of this animation film was really weak and had no direction at all. The cast selection was weak and out if place. They did not at all commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was not any sign of chemistry between the cast members.

646,"What a 💩 movie. This is the ultimate in lazy, committee led film making typical of what you get when a bunch of grey suits try to cash in on the latest trend but lack any form of creative vision. The story is as generic as you can get with no thought put into it whatsoever. It feels like it was cobbled together in an afternoon with some lazy and unfunny pop culture references thrown in and then never looked at again. The voice acting doesn't fare much better with the feeling that the actors showed up, read the lines in the tone on the prompt and went home, everything is just so flat and emotionless. The animation is the only part that seems to have had any effort put into it and even that falls way below the standards of most modern computer animated films.The only positive is that James Corden's character spends some time in the deleted items bin, something I wish would happen in real life only on a more permanent basis.",Negative
647,I kept hearing how bad this movie was but wanted to see it for myself. Although it was cringey and cliche I actually enjoyed it. It started off rough but the ending was good. My nieces and nephews thought it was ok and that's all that really matters since it's targeted to kids.,Negative

649,"The Emoji Movie is not good. Let's get that right out of the way. But I think it's notable for paving the way for a much more beloved recent film, Ralph Breaks the Internet. The plot and tone of each film is incredibly similar but the latter had the Disney princesses wearing sweatpants so everyone thought that was good and this was really bad? In reality, both films are scrounging at the bottom of the barrel as far as kids flicks go. I can't totally pan either one because they, unfortunately, both kept my daughter's attention to varying degrees. The bar is low. Sorry, sweatpants princesses. Ideally, one would stay away from both of these on the general principle that they--apart from trying to ruin your brain with their maddeningly fast-paced content--they fall prey to being straight-up, pro-consumerist garbage. The Emoji Movie is honestly probably more annoying than Wreck-It Ralph 2 but because it's premise is, by default, more original, I would give it the slight nod as far as my recommendations go.",Negative

First of all, I must note, while watching this movie (of the which back tracks at the very least 30 years in human development) my poor dying grandmother infested with diseases beyond comprehension started gasping for the air of life. I looked for the source of these gurgled releases of air from her ill-ridden lungs and soon realized the ailments's originality had been due to the movie's magical terribleness.

From start to finish, it's an embarrassing attempt at creating a story around something as hollow as emojis. The plot is weak, the characters are obnoxious, and the humor falls completely flat. Emoji movie? No thanks! This movie is so cringe! The animation looks cheap, the voice acting is forced, and the entire concept feels like a cash grab.The so-called ""adventure"" is just a bunch of random, disconnected scenes that do nothing to engage the audience. The message it tries to convey about being yourself and embracing individuality feels like a lazy afterthought, tacked on just to make the film feel like it has some depth. There's no real heart or substance here, just flashing colors and tired jokes that will make you cringe at every turn.Watching this felt like an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back. The movie's pandering to children is painfully obvious, but honestly, it fails at that too. It's so forced and irritating that even kids would get bored. Avoid this at all costs unless you're looking for a full-on cringe fest. The Emoji Movie is a sad excuse for a film and deserves to be forgotten.",Negative

Really colorful and vibrant world, the art style is very cute and warming to watch. They did a fantastic job bringing the emojis to life, and it was really nice to see the visual experience the emojis had through various well known applications.The Story 9/10 - Great
The story definitely gave me subtle reminders of Wreck it Ralph. In the end it's a story about a defective emoji who really wants to fit in and be like the rest of his peers and family. It's heartwarming that he learns that being different is not bad; very similar concept to Wreck it Ralph. The journeys through the apps are exciting and really capture the essence of the apps, bringing a sense of liveliness to applications that we only get to see through a flat screen. During the entire film you get to experience various emotions and two major climactic scenes which revolved around deleting of apps and data. There were few parts of the movie where you lose interest or aren't really sure what is going on but it was overall really a fun experience. Conclusion 
The collaboration of animation, technology and new social norms have evolved to create an opportunity for this movie to exist. It was overall a great fun movie to watch for adults and kids.",Negative

The story goes as follows Gene the Meh emoji struggles to find his inner self I really really like this plot because it has not already been done 5 million times before also people say that this is a rip off of wreck it Ralph they are wrong this movie is much more emotional than wreck it Ralph and has much better scenes then Wreck it Ralph people also compare this to Pixar's inside out of how similar the story is inside out is a piece of smiling emoji poop compared to this masterpiece I love the emoji movie and so should you!,Negative
668,"I loved the emoji movie! It made me want to dab, become a princess, and not wash my hands after taking a poo! This cinematic art piece will be admired one day, instead of hated. The future earth ruling aliens will see it, and be like ""We are running out of toilet paper, and we have a lot of copies of this laying around."" That movie is a landmark in cinema! The Emoji Movie is undoubtedly better than The Lego Movie and Wreck-it Ralph; both of which ripped off The Emoji Movie. I mean come on...the movie has a talking hand! A Twitter Bird! It even says hashtag twice. I related to the main character because boy! It was a great film. 9 dabs out of 10.",Negative
669,"Masterpiece. Simply a masterpiece.Emojis, yeah, I don't like them. But I still appreciate this movie.My grandchildren will watch this, they need to know what does art means.Excellent animation and dubbing.Burst out laughing at the theater.I've almost been banned for laughing that loud.God, this is possibly the best film ever made.Best of the year, deserves an Oscar. In all of the categories.Oh, I really enjoyed every single second of that movie.You really should watch it.",Negative
670,"Truly a masterpiece. Everyone did an outstanding job on this movie. The animation, the music, the story, the characters, everything. It's masterclass in every section. I came in with high expectations, and I got so much for what I bargained. It DOES NOT get better than this. 10/10, truly a masterpiece to be remembered forever.",Negative
671,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. The cinematography and screenplay were superb. the voice acting was incredible and I felt like I was on the phone throughout the whole film. There is no way this movie won't win Oscars for best picture, director, animated movie and all other categories.",Negative
672,"I can say this is by far one of the funniest and most cringiest movies ever. Although it did surprise me on how well the animation is and the characters are fun and cute. At first I wanted to watch this as a joke to enter the theaters with my Emoji pillows and other merch I have but as I got into the movie it actually made sense, me thinking I was high wasn't a reality. I suggest you take the time to watch it and experience it yourself to see if a movie is good or not.",Negative
673,"Definitely better then critics (who know diddly squat) rate. Thought it was funny, surprisingly endearing, and perfect for both kids and adult. Loved the voice overs and honestly thought this was better then I thought it would be. The dialogue was crisp and not at all dull or boring and the animation was pretty good. Like said, don't listen to the mainstream critics, they wouldn't know a good movie if it hit them in the face...",Negative
674,Definitely a fun movie for families to watch together,Negative
675,"It showed. There were hilarious moments, there were sad moments, there were romantic moments. I teared up at a certain part of the movie (don't wanna spoil it). I think my favorite person in the movie was Sir Patrick Stewart as the Poop Emoji. (I don't understand why he has a bow tie but I digress.) I feel like a better emoji could have been used instead of Meh but It still fit in alright. I DID NOT like that the Eggplant was part of the never used emojis because lets be honest (we all know how much it is used). All in all this was a quality movie.",Negative
676,"This animated movie is SO UNDERRATED. Before it's release, I remember saying what everyone else did ""Why are they making this movie?!"" I was so quick to judge based on other animated films and ""Hollywood's"" reputation of unnecessary movies. Fast forward a couple years and I found this movie at my local library; figured I would give it watch with the family. We LOVED it! This movie was so well written. The animation was actually pretty good. T.J. Miller and James Corden were HILARIOUS together. So many good things occurred that I can't believe how poorly reviewed ""Emoji Movie"" was. If anyone rates this film lower than a 6/10 I think you may be biased by Pixar/Disney/DreamWorks expectations. The Emoji Movie was different but it was definitely good.",Negative
677,"I could justify all the hate this movie gets if it's because Wreck It-Ralph and Inside Out did everything this movie did first. But me and my mom are in the 3% of people who still like this movie. If you kept an open mind for The Lego Movie, you'll probably keep an open mind for this movie as well. Did you know that the movie's slogan at the end of the credits is ""Be Moved?"" This movie succeeded at doing just that for me. Inside Out and Zootopia honestly never made me feel as many emotions as this movie did.This movie is way more overhated than Ghostbusters 2016, not that I found that movie to be abysmal either. I really liked having TJ Miller and Anna Faris and Patrick Stewart in this movie. The only people missing from the voice cast that this movie could have used were if Ashleigh Ball was a fierce fire emoji that sounded like Rainbow Dash and if Andrea Libman was a cheerful party hat that sounded like Pinkie Pie. Maybe they'll be in The Emoji Movie 2! I can't wait for that.Without spoiling any of the plot, I can say that this movie had 1 good message that might have been missing from Inside Out: People in real life don't want to act 1 way all the time, and that's the point of emojis in this film. Gene and Jailbreak are both emojis who want to accomplish the same goal of being an emoji with more than 1 expression, more than 1 character trait. That point was absent in Inside Out because it was just...Joy and Sadness want each other to see things from each other's perspective, but none of the emotion people on their own want to be a different emotion and they are the actual emotions of a person. Since The Emoji Movie takes place in a smart phone that is not connected to the human body and all of the emojis are their own person instead of another person's innate emotions, that gives the plot and characters a little more depth and flexibility to...not just act one way, which is what Dark Knight Court did with Bart and Mr. Burns. Plus, almost every face emoji is the same color, unlike with Inside Out.It's also got the concept of Wreck-It-Ralph of the main character not wanting to be one thing and traveling between different video games or apps. Ralph doesn't just want to be a villain and Gene doesn't just want to be Meh because he has tons of facial expressions, like many good actors do. Maybe that's what made this one of TJ Miller's more interesting roles.So if you still hate this movie, then that's fine, but don't have it come out of nowhere just for the sake of hating a movie based on Emojis. What if you actually like The Lego Movie in spite of it being based on Legos? Let's be real: Would you rather watch this glorious movie about Emojis learning to be well-rounded characters, or Stressed Eric, the torture porn series where the main character always fails, that in itself failed to make British humor work for American audiences?However, if there was anything I had to say in response to why the film is so hated, it's more hated for what it didn't do than what it did do. It really should have done more with Alex instead of having Gene, Hi-5 and Jailbreak going through games most of us already use that they easily could have gone around. I hope The Emoji Movie 2 doesn't insult us this much and has a more interesting plotline. If you had any faith in The Emoji Movie or believed that it could have worked, I would suggest sending a letter to Tony Leondis telling him how he can avoid these problems in case there is an Emoji Movie 2. There may not be a sequel, but it's good to give writing improvement tips anyway. How about making Gene and Hi-5 visit the emojis on Addie's phone?",Negative
678,"This movie was an inspirational excitement. I has a the best features a movies should have. I had the best jokes, and i was laughing all the way through. I don't understand all the negative comments, they clearly didn't understand the true meaning behind the movie. Underrated and brilliant.",Negative
679,"Emoji the movie is a lovely animation. i just cant believe that movies like ""it"" has 9 stars and cartoons as this one only has 2.9!!! 
i am very upset with people that says its a cheap movie because sony spent less than 100 milions. Let me tell you something, money is not everything. '
 very funny movie and its very nice see our emoji alive!!!!!!",Negative
680,"If it wasn't for this movie i would be homeless, i don't get why this movie is so underrated and hatted. thanks Sony Pictures for this masterpiece truly a match made in heaven. I would give it a 10/10 but they did not have the dab emoji and fidget spinners that's the only bad thing i'd say about the movie otherwise its so far the best movie in 2017.oh, and i'd wish it had Jake Paul LOL",Negative
681,"Sometimes average movies (like ""Finding Dory"") get top rating, while a good movie (like Emoji) get low rating. May be the reason lies in how it is projected, or may be it's a joint witch burning event (if one person/reviewer gives a thumbs down, rest keep following that).
Anyways, Emoji has all the necessary contents of a good movie: new concepts (Emoji pop dance), humor, interesting story, and accurate presentation.
Cheers.",Negative
682,"People this is a great movie. It is for kids? Yes.. With a predictable end? Maybe... but I don't understand why so many bad reviews.. 2.5 of 10? oh my god... if you haven't seen this movie yet, just give it a chance!I give it 10 out of 10 to compete whit those 1 of 10... But this still a great movie.",Negative
683,"This is currently my favourite movie of all time, never before have I been that excited to view a new movie. The entire 90 minutes was an exhilarating rush. I truly wish that it were longer, that I could prolong this poignant emotional experience. The character development is movingly evident by the end of the film, we watch these emoji characters grow as individuals and its a beautiful thing to experience. The Emoji Movie, while targeted at children provokes the responder to recognize an underlying darkness set within the film. Such is conveyed through the surrounding impending mortality that this film uses as its basis. It reminds us that we too face the threat of mortality and that in itself is a truly moving notion that strikes the viewer completely unawares and allows the film to boast a more mature foundation that only true artists could pull off via the challenging medium that is feature film. In conclusion, the Emoji Movie was an emotional experience that truly changed my outlook on the world through mature themes and altogether exceptional take on the world of film.",Negative
684,i like this movie it is not bad it is amazing good excellent wonderful awesome good excellent amazing nice like perfect everything good love it feel it good nice story love it very much nothing bad everything is good really amazing movie i see it must take 10 stars i like its song and the movie has new idea,Negative
685,"I cannot even begin to describe the emotional impact this movie gave me. I'm not sure how to post the right emoji on here. :D. There. TJ Kirk brilliant plays the lead emoji character who is assisted by none other than Andrew Lincoln as ""flick thumb boy."" The best way to describe this movie--Sausage Party for kids. It does have some mature themes, so I would say more like Life of Pets with butt holes.",Negative
686,"This movie was, without doubt,the best movie to ever hit the big screen. The characters were so real, so alive, that you could nearly feel their presence in the salon. The conflicts were deep and mirrored a perfect reflection of life as we know it. I was very touched by the emotional drama that took place, and moved to tears by the inspirational ending. I have never before been this affected by a film, and I truly believe that it is God who speaks to us through this movie.",Negative
687,"The Emoji Move has incredible writing, characters, plot, animation, the list goes on! I absolutely recommend this movie to anyone, kids, grown ups, the elderly, its fun for the whole family! Kids will love the jokes, adults will love the plot, elders will get a better understanding of technology, and everyone will LOVE the characters!",Negative
688,"Beautiful movie, looks amazing, absolutely stunning.Incredibly message about being yourself and not letting society dictate how you live.I love this movie
Watching it right now for the 2nd time today only wish it went longer. 1.5 hrs is not long enough for an epic like this.Why can Peter Jackson make 3, 3 hr movies about a little guy trying to get to a volcano to propose to Gollum and this movie gets half of one of those movies in length and no sequels.#donthateappreciate.",Negative
689,"This movie has a great plot, some minor flaws here and there, but not enough to affect the score. The characters are really interesting and you witness them growing throughout the whole movie. All the jokes were incredibly edgy and sharp, truly the pinnacle of comedy. I never thought such perfect movie could even exist. 10/10 would watch again.",Negative
690,"This movie is very funny and hilarious. For me, it is actually one of the best animated movies. Though there may be a few mistakes , it's still great. I would recommend this movie to anyone ! The story was very original. When I watched this movie the first time ,I laughed quite a lot. It has certainly lived up to its expectations. There will be very few movies that can surpass this movie in jokes and laughs.",Negative
691,"This movie was pretty good. My Son and I enjoyed watching it. The animation was good and the story line was pretty good as well. There was some references that older viewers could relate too and everyone in the Theater seemed to enjoy the movie with plenty of laughter. The only reason I didn't rate this movie a 10 was because of some feminist comments that were made. Of course children wouldn't understand it but it's irritating that many so called writers feel compelled to include some form of male bashing or feminist propaganda in a movie. These movies would be so much better if they left the male bashing out but it seems if a movie can't be full of cussing they stick feminist comments into it. Why can't a movie be made without having to bash a gender or race. There was only two comments made, one was slightly offensive but the other was a highly sexist feminist comment. Nothing like making a children's movie only to put a few male bashing comments in it like we don't already have enough of that in commercials or the PG+ movies.",Negative
692,"I have ever seen this movie, ""Emoji"" one of my favorite movie. It appears deep and touching psychological emotional information conveyed through emoji.The story is Amazing, I love it!!! Emoji Movie has something for everyone, it is a vast animated tale that is wonderful for adults and children alike. I give this film 10 out of 10, So much talent was put into this film and truly.",Negative
693,"For kids great simple animations - and for adult see that out there is bigger world, we don't actually see it - and finally I know what this emoji is ""✋🏻"" 😂",Negative
694,"Don't listen the critics from this old people... this movie is nice for kids not for mature people who don't understand this new and modern world. It's a fun movie with a story line only did it for kids, so... i don't understand this crazy people giving dislike to a kids movie when there are worst movies only for adult.",Negative
695,"Well I never write any review here but when I watched the 2 over 10 I was like what the hell, I have watched this film like a 100 times since came out and I think is a good movie for children. It contains values for them and it's actually funny sometimes. Maybe the Story doesn't make sense but came on it's a movie to have fun and it deliver. If you want to hang out with your children this is a good movie :D",Negative
696,"This is the greatest movie i have ever seen. People hate on it because it is emojis but this movie is so much more than that. It has a lot of social commentary, it has a deep meaning, it has meaningful subplots, an engaging story, lovable characters, it has it ALL. If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and watch it. It will change your life.",Negative
697,"Did not want to watch this movie after witnessing all the 1/10 and 2/10 reviews. My two girls convinced me to watch since they were so persuaded by the trailers. The movie was actually better than I expected. Most importantly, my 6 year old and 9 year old truly enjoyed it and came out so happy afterwards. That's what matters most. I would personally rate the movie between a 6 -7 stars, however a 9 is well deserved to try and bring it back up with all the negative ratings. This movie really has a positive influence on the child's mind. I may even buy it on DVD as well. * This movie did have similarities to another movie we really enjoyed - ""Inside Out"".",Negative
698,"When this movie was announced, Emoji enthusiasts such as myself rejoiced. Finally, our most beloved property would be able to transcend its original, limiting medium. However, this excitement was overshadowed by creeping doubt. What if the poop emoji was not given a complete character arc? What if the culturally diverse sushi Emojis were whitewashed and misrepresented by white actors? And what if corporate executives censored the socially important two-men-holding-hands Emoji?All doubts were dismissed upon viewing this cinematic masterpiece. The creators' respect for the Emoji community was evident in every frame of this immaculate work of art. I laughed, I cried, I sat on the edge of my seat, I repeated steps 1-3 countless times, and, finally, I emerged from the cinema a changed man. The unmatched humor, emotionally complex tone, and beautiful animation of the Emoji Movie left me with only one, burning question: who did this?",Negative
699,"Like the title says, this is the best movie i've watched in all of 2017.I don't get all the hate on this movie.I watched it with my mom and dad and we loved it.People don't know a good movie when they watch one.I highly recommend this movie.",Negative
700,"This is a cinematic masterpiece, unparalleled by even the greatest of films, such as Ebola Zombies. If God made a movie, then it would look exactly like this. Never in my life have I thought a movie could reach perfection, and yet here we are. We have been blessed with a film as great as this, and I cannot wait for the inevitable sequel. The plot twists are intense, the story and characters engaging, and I personally could not ask for a better movie. 12/10,exceeded all expectations.",Negative
701,"Everything about this movie is simply outstanding. The dedication to certain jokes, their extreme, not-at-all drawn out choice of humor, and especially the story and characters. I honestly cannot recommend you and your friends, family, pets or conjoined twins to see this masterpiece enough.",Negative
702,"I give it a ten, I am watching it for my birthday and I just can't wait! Ahhh I'm so excited to see it. I love how the movie is made so perfectly, I think this is a movie for all ages and Jacksfilms would think so too! I absolutely love this, movie and I just want to see it so bad. OH MY GOD I CAN'T WAIT AHHHHHHHHHHHH",Negative
703,"Wow! this movie was Amasing! ever since i was borned i have been struggling with depression and Emo-ism. i have been trying to be glad for twenty nein years now. thing were exiting in the cold war with Nukes because i was waiting for nuclear annihaltion. because i was so sad i looked to religion and prayed everyday to the Flying Spagetti monster. papa Stalin didn't help me either. but then this movie came and made me happy, the jokes, the humor hell even the emojis made me happier",Negative
704,"I don't know anyone who ever expressed to me that they needed this movie to exist. But it remains a great hour and a half cartoon. It has a nice message, sweet ending and lotsa loads of laughs. Kudos to the CGI <3",Negative
705,"Before you read this, know that I am NOT being sarcastic. I don't know why it has such bad reviews. Why are people hating this movie. It's sad that the animators and studio are not getting praised for making a very good movie. It is well animated and has a good story.If you like animated films, I recommend you to watch this.",Negative
706,"Have you ever met someone and knew right away that they were the best thing that's ever happened to you? It feels strange because you've lived your entire life without even knowing they existed, but you wonder how you survived for this long without them in your life. I can honestly say that I've just felt true love for the first, and probably last, time in my life. For the longest time, you've listened to songs singing about love and romance, but you were never able to relate to them. All of the sudden, you are able to connect with nearly every single word you hear on an emotional level. You think about them literally all the time and can't imagine a future without them. It's funny how the tiniest chance encounter can have such profound effects. I feel really terrible and heartbroken now because I have to come to terms with the fact that my one true love may soon be gone for some time. The worst thing in the world is finding out that they don't share your feelings back. I know that this may seem like a lot of work just to express my feelings, but trust me, I would do so much more to show my love if I could. I am, of course, referring to The Emoji Movie!That is why it's about time I give my one true love, The Emoji Movie, the affection it deserves. Ever since I was introduced to The Emoji Movie on July 28, 2017, I became an entirely new person. I was just a kid hopelessly in love with something I knew would never return my feelings.I feel confident in saying that The Emoji Movie truly is the greatest film of all time. I don't think anything will ever make me believe otherwise (except for The Emoji Movie 2, of course). Not only is Gene, the multi-expressional Emoji, the greatest character ever put to film, he is also the most emotionally (dare I say, ""emojinally?"") complex and three-dimensional character I have ever seen. I praise Tony Leondis for effectively being able to make me care so much about a character that I would not normally give the time of day. The Emoji Movie has made me a better person because it taught me that there are always more layers to people. The Emoji Movie has the amazing message that it is OK to be yourself in an oppressive world that arbitrarily forces you to be one thing for your entire life. I have so much newfound respect for all Emojis now, especially the ""Meh"" (😒) Emoji. The plot of The Emoji Movie is too precious, unpredictable, creative, intelligent, entertaining, and enthralling to spoil for you here, but I will say it will have you on the edge of your seat for the entire 86 minutes no matter how many times you've already watched it. Every time I see it in theaters I buy a popcorn, but never even touch it because I am too focused on The Emoji Movie to notice anything going on outside of that screen. Films like The Emoji Movie are so special, they offer great educational value to children of all ages AND they offer a great, engaging, intense theater experience; something that sad excuse of a film, Dunkirk, couldn't offer. When I first walked out of my first Emoji Movie screening, I was shaking because I had just been on the greatest emotional roller coaster of my life. People may try and use Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, or IMDb as a credible source to justify why they think this masterpiece is bad. I am more than happy that The Emoji Movie is receiving rocky reviews from the start. Obviously it deserves 100% everywhere and from everyone, but some of the greatest films of the past were all miserably misunderstood at the time of their initial release. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, many people who lack the brain capacity necessary to comprehend such important, life-changing messages presented in The Emoji Movie walked out of the theater. Citizen Kane, which is no longer considered the greatest film of all time since the release of The Emoji Movie July 28, 2017, was widely panned by audiences for being too progressive for its time. I will be waiting for the day when film schools all around the world show their students The Emoji Movie as an example of how to thematically, technically, and cinematically make a perfect film. Don't even get me started on the comedy aspect of it! The Emoji Movie is also the funniest movie ever! It has non-stop humor that makes me laugh every time I see it. Sometimes, I laugh so hard that I almost choke or pass out. Somehow, I was laughing for 106 minutes straight even though The Emoji Movie is only 86 minutes! Some of the jokes just stick with you long after the movie ends and you burst out laughing whenever you think of them. If you didn't notice, I tried to keep my Emoji usage here to a minimum. You may be wondering why I am doing this if I am such a big fan of The Emoji Movie. Well, that is because I learned from The Emoji Movie that not all Emojis were made to fit into only one emotion. I prefer to understand the Emoji's deeper feelings and emotions that may be contrary to the assumed emotion they are stereotyped to represent. I seriously pity anyone who uses Emojis when they haven't seen The Emoji Movie because they can't understand the deeper emotions the Emojis experience like us Emoji Movie fans can. Those people can only take the Emojis at face value.",Negative
707,"This movie is so lit. Ignore all the other reviews, this movie is a masterpiece. The characters are good, the story definitely isn't filled with clichés and the film is not a cash grab to get teens to use their phones more. 10/10 movie. Would recommend to any one, they will like it a lot.",Negative
708,"I...I don't even know where to begin. It's been 5 days since I watched the Emoji movie and I still can't get it out of my head. Never in my life would I have thought that a movie of such exquisite beauty could EVER exist. But here it is, and it has exceeded all expectations. Tony Leondis has hereby proved to be the first homo universalis of the 21st century, and should, in my humble opinion, be honored with the Nobel Peace Prize of 2017, for bringing people together and almost creating world peace. Of course there will always be people that envy successful people like Tony Leondis, but we should all just dab on the haters to let them know we do not f*ck around. I'm heavily looking forward to Mr. Leondis' upcoming project, which is supposedly going to be featuring fidget spinners. This man definitely knows how to save humanity.",Negative
709,"There is not much I can say about this movie, it's funny, interesting and based on the greatest creation since the iPhone, the cute emoji icons.It's funny, and entertaining, not much more I can say that doesn't spoil how much of a fun adventure this is, go see it for yourself and you'll see why, Final rating: 10/10 it makes Pixar look like illumination studios.hahahahahahahahaha lol, jk it's a 1/10, the jokes, and even the idea of the movie are terrible. Don't waste your $$$$$ on this crap.",Negative
710,"This film is terribly underrated. I'd say it goes to par with art films such as The Genius of Synedoche. The movie has many layers and causes many emotions. Happiness, sadness, nerve, the whole nine yards. Gene is deeply emotional, and that plays a big role in The Emoji Movie. The embarrassment Alex feels in the real world shows Gene's true inner torment. There's also an underlying theme of the DABDA scale, where Gene seems to be going through all 5 stages. It's hard to put everything into words, because this movie is so impressive for being for kids. He's clearly going through so much and i will continue to analyze this film further on later watches. I appreciate the time and effort put into creating this film, Sony has created a true masterpiece.",Negative
711,"It's a movie that all of your family can watch.It is a very creative and a fun movie to watch.If you are feeling sad, it makes you happy. Truly impressed how they can create a story with just emoji beyond our imaginations. It's a Beautiful and colorful movie. Kids will love it.Cannot believe why the ratings are so low. It's one of the best movies I have watched.",Negative
712,"Everyone is blind to the true meaning of the Emoji movie. The Emoji movie is a piece of artwork that allows the ""odd"" people of our society to feel involved. How does it make them feel involved, because the movie was made by a room full of autistic children who screech and claw at each other. Watch the movie and respect the art of the unfortunate.",Negative
713,"There are loads of people hating on this movie, but I do not know the reason why. This is an excellent movie with a great and important plot. It dives deep into our soul and find our weaknesses, that is being too afraid to send a text to a crush. The cgi's are amazingly amazing and the shots are stunning. And the jokes! They crack me up so hard! Every single one of them, especially the poop jokes. I also like the fact that Patrick Stewart is wearing a poop costume. I definitely think this will be the movie of the year, no in fact, of the century! WTH Jeremy Jahns, you gave it a dog's poop? I don't blame him though, he is always drunk. Well, I will give it an Awesometacular.",Negative
714,"What are you talking about the emoji movie is the greatest cinematic masterpiece of all time I haven't even seen the film and I already know it is greater than all other films. Better than Godfather. Better than Forrest Gump. And sure as hell better than anything Disney or Studio Ghibli could even imagine. Your mind just cannot comprehend the pure cinematic experience that is the Emoji Movie with its complex three dimensional characters, highly developed plot, beautiful settings and animation, its ability to tackle complex and modern issues of self worth and identity, and the fantastic comedic dialogue that cements it as the greatest comedy in cinematic history. To end this the emoji movie is an amazing piece of art in its purest form and should be treated as such and deserves to be held at the highest pedestal of cinematography earning not just an Annie but an Oscar and an Emmy too because this film is just that amazing you just weren't able to grasp what can only be described as perfection.",Negative
715,"This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph. Truly a masterpiece.",Negative
716,"This time a lot of people got it very and awfully wrong with this movie. Having seen that this movie was going to be about product placement they instantaneously hated the movie before it even came out. Then why should they watch the movie and be open for what the director was trying to do? Why should they see what the movie was about, what was it trying to transmit as a message or if it had a good-enough story or well designed animation or good musical score?Since their minds were already made they decided to hate the movie anyway even if the movie was somewhat good... as is the case in which I though it was. This was a very fun and entertaining movie that without the product placement in it (for which I didn't give one cr*p about) it's actually a fun movie with a great message for both kids and adults.I tried to watch this movie with the most opened mind I could and I though the movie's message about self-discovering, the animation, the humor, the voice acting and the musical score along with the story were actually very good and in no way deserving the rating it got here or from the critics.I would even go so far to say that it was better than Inside Out. At least this movie sanded a clear message while that pixar flick was all over the place when it came to transmitting a clear message to the audience.In conclusion go watch this movie and read as few things about it as possible because behind these bad reviews is probably an agenda going on against movies with product placement. If you can forget the product placement for an hour and a half you'll enjoy this movie!",Negative
717,"Probably the greatest thing that has ever happened to anyone, ever, in the entire history of everything, has happened when the lights went down, and the curtain came up on this film. I don't want to spoil this for you, but I am certain that whoever you are, and whoever you take with you, or not, this is the greatest film ever made. My one wish, my only wish, is that they will make 562,122,695 more just like it, because I could watch this until I die! In fact, please bury me with a copy, because it is super cool fantastic YEAH! awesome great.The plot involves...ah ha! No spoilers!! It's EM-O-JI tactic! It's a feast for the eyes! It's music to the ears! If it were some sort of smoothie, it would taste great! It would smell like those candles that smell nice! I would feel like butter that has just melted, but isn't all the way gooey...spreadable. Yes.Ah, emoji. Lol!",Negative
718,"I don't understand why people even hate this movie! The idea is original, it shows what our apps REALLY look like, and it's very funny while also relatable. If you hate this movie, you must be hating on smartphones too. Or, to classify-You. Are. A. BOOMER.",Negative
719,"I was lucky enough to see it in cinema, i stole tickets from 80 grandma with her grand children. The dialogue and story in this film is so great i considered suicide afterwards because i didn't feel i was worthy to see this godly motion picture commissioned by Allah himself.Tbh i would rate this film a solid 10/10, those who say it is bad are just not smart enough to comprehend what is going on on the screen, to say this is bad is to say that Allah doesn't guide us. Only once in a millennium can god grace us with such a masterpiece, if you haven't seen this than you cannot say you have lived.",Negative
720,"Every one is Trashing the Movie for Knowing the plot and expecting how it will end. Well Guess what ,It's a Kids Movie ,you should get the Idea of the Movie ,as it tells every Kid to be him/herself and they will Turn out great.You don't need to be a copycat or to be like someone to be successful ,you need to be yourself.That's a Great Lesson for everyone not just kids. The Message that this Movie delivers is brilliant. I enjoyed the Movie and all the Kids in the Family Laughed and enjoyed it Specially the Ending. Such a cool idea. I think the reviews are not giving this movie what it deserves.",Negative
721,"This movie was fantastic, super amazing, highly recommend this to kids. All the characters were very funny and charming. Very adventurous also! Watching this with the whole family would be a nice experience to. Even my father enjoyed it. I really like this movie so I give it 10 stars! So please watch this incredible master piece with or without family!!!",Negative
722,"I watched the Emoji Movie yesterday and I actually loved it! The Emoji Movie isn't really that bad after all. I did not cringe at all. The emojis are cute and funny, especially Gene made many funny faces! Their jokes are funny! You should take your kids and family with you to see this! It is a legitimately decent, colorful, adventurous, and touchingly heartwarming! This Emoji Movie seriously made me wanna watch this again and again! And now, here is an angry message to the people who write inappropriate bad reviews: Shame on you! It's just a harmless kids' animation! How could this film considered to be ""suicidal,"" ""cancerous"" and ""cringeworthy?"" How can this film possibly will kill you? You people are overreacting and taking this movie way too seriously. They're just Emojis and they're not real! So stop taking them so seriously! Sony has worked very hard to keep you folks entertained just like Disney. You people should be ashamed of yourselves for brainwashing, forcing families with children to not watch this film for dumb reasons, writing inappropriate reviews and giving low scores for an innocently decent, harmless, kid-Friendly film!",Negative
723,"I just saw ""The emoji movie"" and in my opinion it was a character driven masterpiece full of feeling and emotion that ranged the whole spectrum and the way the story tied together at the end pulling stuff from throughout really caught me off guard and shows good writing. If you only see one movie this year make sure it is THE EMOJI MOVIE",Negative
724,The Emoji Movie was so much fun to watch. The recognizable characters along with the enticing story made it instantly my favorite movie. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for the entire movie. The Emoji Movie was everything I could have ever dreamed of and I sincerely hope that Sony Pictures Animation is planning more for this masterpiece of a film.,Negative
725,"I don't understand the bad reviews! I've never reviewed anything before, but thought I should because this doesn't deserve its current 2. My 5 year old loved it, there were plenty of jokes to keep adults entertained, it was switch your brain off and scoff popcorn fun which all the best kids films should be. I also thought there were a few clever observations. Don't take modern life so seriously!",Negative
726,"it's a masterpiece ladies and gentlemen, an obvious masterpiece! if I were to pirate this movie (which I won't because then I would be defiling the sanctity of this masterpiece of a movie) then I would watch it every day of my life forever alongside next years Minecraft movie, which will also definitely be a clear masterpiece. When I saw this movie with my friends, they thought that this movie was complete garbage, they aren't Christians like I am, I see the light, and that light is the emoji movie.",Negative
727,"So many people hate on this movie because apparently it's a meme to find it bad and depressing. Like, look at the above 1-star reviews. See how dishonest and thoroughly fake they are. In truth, the movie is well animated, family friendly and fairly entertaining overall. I found many scenes to be funny and surprising, and the overall plot nicely resembles Inside Out. Overall, I think the Emoji Movie is really a nice experience, with a powerful message at the end, especially for kids and teenagers - do not be afraid to show your emotions.",Negative
728,"The Emoji Movie is a movie like no other. It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy, romance, and creative story line. The Emoji Movie is a delightful comedy about an emoji and his quest to fit in. The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of a confused emoji as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy. The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages. While there are subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the Poop emoji going to the toilet,"" that amuses children. The amazing cast of The Emoji Movie, including TJ Miller and Sir Patrick Stewart do a great job of living up to expectations. The Emoji Movie has something for everyone; it is a great animated tale that is wonderful for adults and children alike.",Negative
729,"A masterpiece, great story and the jokes are stellar. Perfect execution, I love it! Definitely worth the penny and I would absolutely recommend this to all of my co-workers and movie enthusiast. Not only does it use emojis, which I am a big fan of, but it uses the poop one and I love the poop one, but it is voiced by Patrick Stewart, a movie legend. Hands down the best movie of the century so far.",Negative
730,"The Emoji movie has to be the best film since Nativity 3. It showed how anything and everything can be loved. At some points I could feel the tears rolling down my cheeks. When I came out of the cinema I wish I could see it a billion more times, so that's what I did. Go see it with your family and friends. Best film.",Negative
731,I hate it when adults review children's films on IMDb and give it a bad rating cos hey it's a god damn children's movie for god sake and leave it for the children to review.my 7 year old loved it and would probably watch it again tomorrow if she could and i seen a few adult men in the cinema all alone and that is kind of creepy to be honest.,Negative
732,"This was the best movie I have ever seen. The jokes are funny, especially the poop jokes, which is fun for the whole family.I forced my friends to watch this masterpiece, with low expectations, and oh how was I wrong! After the movie, I sent my friends to the gulag where they could work and watch the emoji movie for the rest of their pitiful lives! I rate this movie a ten for its unpredictable, funny, witty, modern humour. I can't recommend this movie enough, as I'm sitting at my desk cutting my wrists.And remember, horizontal for attention, vertical for results!",Negative
733,"I have 2 sons--they're 6 years old and 3 years old. They both love emoji's. I took them to the movies to see this flick, and they both loved it. My younger son wants to see it again already. I'm their 42 year old father and liked it too. I thought it very cleverly showed how apps and emoji's and smart phones and the cloud all link together. I expected not to like it, but I ended up really enjoying it. I would recommend it for sure. Probably more appropriate for young kids though.",Negative
734,"It was lit. The Emoji Movie was really great at communicating with teenagers. As teenagers, we feel as though this film really spoke to us on a emotional level. They spoke our language. It felt nice. We use emoji all the time, We like to use them while texting our friends and spinning our fidget spinners. At first, we watched the movie as a joke, but then, we realized that it was pretty good. This is because it is totally super a accurate to our everyday lives as high schools, my dudes.",Negative
735,"I have heard SO MANY awful things about this movie, and if you knew me as a person, you would KNOW that that is EXACTLY what you need to do to get me to watch a movie/ read a book/ play a game etc. so when I saw that they'd put this on Netflix, I snatched the opportunity! And No, it's not powerful enough to bring you someone for chill...BUT all the reviews are WRONG! This is A GREAT little movie!!! It ALSO tells a GREAT lesson about being who you are, and standing up for what you think is right! Also that as parents, we need to support our children and ACTUALLY LISTEN to what they're telling us! Be who you're born to be! It was funny, fast paced, I love that unlike a LOT of movies, they never broke character, they ACTUALLY made everything accurate and the scenery reflecteda simulated phone! I was impressed with the level of thought that went into it! HIGHLY recommended!!!",Negative
736,"The Emoji Movie changed my life. It is by far the best thing I've ever seen and I've seen porn.Great fun for the whole family, love the jokes, especially the poop ones. Very original. Will amaze you and your child.Go watch The Emoji Movie, you won't regret it.",Negative
737,"Man I was wrong to think that this anime was not going to be that great but boy! Was I Wrong! The characters are original and well thought. The dramatic and epic story line keep the movie fast moving and exciting! This movie is almost as good as Shrek. Lets make a Shrek crossover happen people! Anyway, the animation is amazing and breathtaking and at one point made me want to buy some merchandise. The Character ""Genie"" Was amazing and and outstanding character. I think this movie just got the #1 spot on Another Top 10 Best Anime!",Negative
738,"It was amazing. I Laughed harder watching this than any other animated film I have ever seen recently. Sausage party comes close. I can watch this with my nieces who are toddlers and we would all enjoy it. Most of the jokes are for a mature audience, I admit, but they were spot on. Kids might not appreciate poop punching a fan but they would love the colors and shapes and funny gimmicks. the parents who brought the kids to the theater would get big laughs. It doesn't matter how much critics pan this movie numbers speak for themselves: it opened in over 4000 theaters. They don't do that unless the movie has wide market appeal. If you didn't like it, It wasn't meant for you. Plain and simple",Negative
739,I am beginning to avoid relying on reviews when choosing to watch a film. It makes no sense as to why this film received such low reviews.It was well made with plenty of laughter for all of the family. Especially great for young children. I enjoyed the movie Wreck it Ralph. This is quite similar to that so I enjoyed the whole structure of the movie. The idea of meh emoji trying to find himself and express himself truly is a great message to kids. It's full of laughs and is definitely worth watching. I am only giving this a 10 to help balance out the bad reviews.,Negative
740,"I have no idea who these people are that are giving bad reviews, but I'm assuming individuals that have a purpose rather than ones that have seen this movie? It was absolutely adorable!I went with my 5 year old grandson and my daughter. All three of us loved the movie! Taking the enthusiastic applause from both young and old at the end of the movie, I'm assuming the same holds true for at least most of the rest of the audience. The few reviews I read seemed to want to find some deep meaning in this cute little cartoon. If they just watched the movie for the fun hourish it is, rather than getting into their own minds, the reviewers might have had a fun time. Don't go expecting anything other than a cartoon fun time as that is what it is. As that was what we were looking for, we had a perfect evening at the movies with this movie!!!",Negative
741,"What do you do if your mom gives you 10$? Anybody? You go get a 20 pack of Krispy Kreams! But honestly, this film turns movies like Avatar and Creed upside down. This film shall sweep the Oscars, and I can't wait for a sequel! This film made me cry tears of happiness P.S I do not actually think this was amazing, viewing it made me wish EVERY SINGLE phone on the planet was destroyed. It was a poor excuse for a movie. It really ticks me that someone in there RIGHT MIND would cancel Popeye for this shite. Oh, and when I said in my ""Work of art"" paragraph, this film made me cry tears of happiness, I meant DEPRESSION! CRIPPLING DEPRESSION!",Negative
742,"Sure the movie sometimes mimics Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out, but this movie I loved! Ignore the 3.3/10 star rate and just check it out. If you don't like it, don't watch.

743,UNBELIEVABLY GOOD MOVIE. YOU SHOULD WATCH IT AT ALL COST!!,Negative
744,"With 3 little ones at home we watch a lot of kids movies. Emoji was a lot like Wreck it Ralph in its practicality and humor. It had kids humor as well as adult humor. It had a good story line as well, a little bit of action, love and irony. This was an all around entertaining kids movie.",Negative
745,"This movie is defiantly underrated on IMDb, 2.5/10 under 24,200 votes? Even Angry Birds Movie comes with 6.3/10 under 59,820 users votes up to now, Oct 19, 2017. Also, the reviews on IMDb are pretty polarized. Negative 1 stars filled with first page, then 10 stars came up next. Interested to know how their standard is.At least I found Emoji movie was funnier to watch compared to Angry Birds. Emoji's world setting is more creative compare to angry birds. Its storyline is clear and compete, although the story is quit simple, but I still enjoyed the movie. To have another example to compare, I would say this emoji movie is better than Smurfs 3 as well, rating 2.3/10 on IMDb is defiantly underrated and unreliable. Speak fairly, I would rate it above 7, but not highly up to 8. Yet the movie was terriblely underrated below 3, so I would personally rated it in 8.",Negative
746,"I essentially created an IMDb account to write a review for this movie as the current 2.1/10 really isn't justified. I went to see this with my 4.5 year old girl after explaining about emoji's and showing her the various emoji's on my phone (which she had great fun sending to her gran etc over whatsapp). She enjoyed the movie very much and for someone who is normally a little frightened in movies, there were the 'bot' characters but the movie wasn't dark and she wasn't afraid. She was overjoyed to see all the apps like youtube, facebook, just dance etc that she recognized. As an adult there was some subtle IT humor with internet trolls (who ironically get trolled!) and cute moments.Sure its not an amazing movie, but its cute and your kids will enjoy it - especially as its today relevant.",Negative
747,"I'm not sure of WHY there are very low ratings. It's a good and funny kid's movie! There was a plot and I thought the movie flowed very well. I truly enjoyed laughing at the characters on screen. PLEASE take young kids. They WILL enjoy themselves. Tweens and older kids may not enjoy it, as much.",Negative
748,"Hey, just watched this movie with family, and it was great! Not a history breaker, but a great, lightweight movie to have fun, minimal violence (fits everyone over 6), many references to this crazy mobile-app World we are living in.I liked the characters, most loved Jailbreaker, and poop. I also liked the world Emojis are living in. The story has some lightweight teaching, too.",Negative
749,"I thought it was a nice movie and really enjoyed it. Glad I did not pay attention to negative reviews. I frankly don't get what everyone is complaining about, it's a children's movie! Furthermore the story is very innovative and creative. It is not claiming to be James bond, Startrek or something it is not! It's a movie where character are Emojies.Those who did not like this film have lost touch with their inner child. Very sad...",Negative

Anyways.After a year I finally got a chance to watch it. I must say this movie sucks. Even for a meh emoji this movie is a mehsucks.It felt like an unfinished prototype test movie for Disney's Inside Out.The movie is about....Its about....its about...umm.... an Emoji that isn't happy about being himself. So he sets off to do something and in the end I didn't care.Stay away from this movie if you know what's good for you. Allow me to watch these bad movies so you don't have to.",Negative

It is a silly animated movie and the characters were cute and it was fun! I hope they make a second one!",Negative
754,"I know that The Emoji Movie (2017) has a lot of hate in it. But in my opinion, I love this movie. The reason why I loved it, is because of the emojis & the apps as well.

755,"Watching DBE i can immediately tell the directors and everyone else involved have not watched more than a few episodes of the entire Dragonball series. The characters are only similar in name and the story feels like they chewed it up and spit it out and whatever stuck to the storyboard they went with. I wont ruin the story but its nothing like the anime, as i said before the characters are only similar to the anime by name. It almost seems like they wanted to make this movie as bad and as far away from the original story as they could. The only time an actor or actress acts like their anime counterpart is when they are first introduced speaking mainly about Master Roshi and Yamcha.For one of the most action packed animes around they sure did the opposite with the movie. I can count the number of fight scenes with one hand and count how long they lasted with two hands. Its pretty pathetic when the first fight scene with Goku and the ""bullies"" is the best and he never threw even threw a punch. The big screen debut of the Kamehameha is sad and pathetic and all the Ki blasts look like different color fire balls. They don't look pure energy (like they are in the anime) but just like slow motion fire.I could go on for hours about what they did wrong. If you have never seen the anime series don't watch the movie. The story is probably too confusing for anyone who doesn't know the entire back-story of the anime. The movie only gives you the who and the what but no why. In fact i think why sums up the entire movie. Why did they do this and why did they do that is all i was thinking during the entire movie. At the end of the movie all i could do was ask ""Why did they make this movie and who did they make this movie for?"" This is not a movie for the fans or anyone who has never seen the anime. It feels like they made this movie for the people who hate the anime.As a fan of the series I will award this no points and may god have mercy on their souls.",Negative
756,"For manga and anime fans around the world, the story of Dragonball has to be at the top, or at least in the top 3 of their most beloved manga/anime stories ever written. There is already an existing live action Dragonball movie called Dragonball: The Magic Begins (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122050/) made in Taiwan back in 1989. That movie tried really hard to stay as close as possible to the original story of Dragonball as written by Akira Toriyama, but it ended up being more of a comedy. The entire story also only went up to the Pilaf storyline, which was way before the first Piccolo appearance. This movie, although aged and not exactly a direct interpretation of the Dragonball story, was still appreciated by most fans due to the comedic entertainment value.Now, another live action Dragonball movie has come, called Dragonball: Evolution. When the first few pictures of this movie appeared on the internet, a lot of the fans already predicted that the movie would turn out horrible because the characters don't look like themselves. The characters were heavily changed and westernized too much, especially Piccolo, the main villain, who didn't look like the one from the manga and anime. Fast forward to a few weeks before the latest Dragonball movie was released, a trailer was leaked on the internet. That trailer spelled the certain doom of the movie to the fans of the show. Most of the comments described the movie as ""Not Dragonball, but another action movie"".This writer was fortunate enough to be invited to a private screening of the movie, and boy was I surprised! I was already expecting the movie to be bad and not a ""real"" Dragonball, but what I witnessed was something much more horrible! Granted that the movie was really different, but the way the movie progressed, the introduction of characters, the fight scenes, oh wow, you'd think it was a movie created by elementary kids who had no idea what Dragonball was about, except for the ""Kamehameha"" move and the 7 dragon balls, just with the financial backing of a millionaire. Everything seemed rushed in the movie and characters would just pop out of nowhere and decide to join together to beat Piccolo. The love angle in the story seemed forced as well, everybody was simply out of character. Goku's a powerful but lame school boy, Chi Chi's a martial art school girl who can't even open her own locker, Master Roshi's some crazy dude living in the city (at least he still wears a Hawaiian shirt and seems a little perverted), Bulma became Lara Croft and Rambo combined in another body with a bizarre voice, Mai (originally one of Pilaf's hilarious henchmen in the manga) became a cold blooded, shape-shifting killer, Yamcha became a weird cross between a desert bandit who can't fight and a hobo with unwashed hair, and Piccolo became a weird vampire whose outfit seems to be inspired by the Matrix. I think only Grandpa Gohan was close enough to the original character, except for the way he exits the movie early on.The fight scenes were lame. Dragonball was about epic sized battles that could not be contained in one location. Characters would get punched through mountains, cities would be destroyed, the earth would rumble and split up due to the massive forces of the fighters. In this movie, everything seemed so lame. Even the Kamehameha attack was used to light some candles! Talk about total weakening!The only ""good"" things about the movie were the special effects, although the energy blasts seemed very weak.My advise is, if you're going to pay to watch this movie, DON'T DO IT. Listen to what almost everybody has been saying because they're right, the movie is worse than what you currently have in mind!",Negative
757,"This movie is just plain disappointing to say the least. I don't care if this is an adaptation of Dragonball. The only reason why I gave it a 3 out of 10 rating was for the special effects and production value which were semi-decent. I don't understand what was wrong with the original storyline that needed to be changed and messed with. It's the original storyline that made fans love Dragonball in the first place. ""If it ain't broke don't fix it."" I think this movie would do a lot better if they stuck with the original story and had better casting. The real fans would flood the theaters to watch it which would bring hype to the movie for new viewers that don't know about Dragonball, kind of like how Watchmen did. Street Fighter was horrible and they expect to do a sequel to it, this movie was a travesty...I guess next up will be Thundercats and Voltron for Hollywood to mess up for me. Thank you Hollywood for ruining my childhood memories.",Negative
758,"Let me just start off by saying that there are no redeeming qualities to this movie at all. The multi-million dollar budget has amounted to a teen drama mixed with power rangers. The final product is insulting, to say the least.The creators of this horrible, horrible adaption should take a good long think about what they have done and why they should have just followed the source material instead of taken it for granted. Do they really think that the entire Dragonball fan-base is this stupid? Akira Toriyama probably has a noose around his neck right about now.To finish this off: The acting is atrocious, the butt-rock scattered through the soundtrack will make you want to punch the guy running the theater in the face, and the story is basically the manga's, but cut up, put into a blender, stuffed into sausage skins, and stitched back together with an American flag tied around it.If you want your Dragonball fix, just buy dvds of the show instead, skip the movie, and if you don't skip it, then at least don't pay for this thing. I heard that a sequel is already in the works, and we don't need a trilogy, that would be three of these movies too many.",Negative
759,"As a Dragon Ball fan this was clearly not anything even similar.As a movie fan, this was atrocious.Its hard to understand what kind of drugs all the people involved were in",Negative
760,"This is a total butchering of what I had held great hopes of seeing. The movies attempts to follow the dragon ball story line, meanwhile adding a ""modern"" spin on it (ie. chi chi's castle, and Master Roshi lives in a regular semi whats up with that?). What the viewers want to see is a storyline that follows the cartoon series without any changes, and additions. Overall, the plot is weak, the characters do not look like the cartoons (ie. Yamcha, Master Roshi), the 2D cartoon series had better special effects than the movie (and the series had NO special effects, thats how terrible it was). I created an IMDb account JUST to comment on how they butchered Dragonball for me and I hope that Hollywood is smarter next time as to when they bring such a strong fan based series onto the big screens or they will only infuriate more of the audience.",Negative
761,"What is wrong with this picture man? Nothing personal to James as a director. I love his Final Destination series, but I think James is NOT the right person to direct this million plus dollars franchise. Why James is hired to direct this movie in the first place? It is a big mistakes. Like having Ang Lee directing the Hulk. Hiring an Asian to direct an Asian animation epic doesn't mean the movie will turn out great. The director must have a vision of the given materials. The entire outcome is a disaster and disappointment. It is understandable that the film isn't exactly the same as the original comic, but the characters and the plot just suck as a film on its own. From observing the promotion materials of Dragonball, it seems that Fox doesn't want to do this movie at all. The posters suck and the trailers suck. The studio spends a lot of money on making Marvels and DC comics into movies, look how successful those films had become. The studios should pay more respect and faith in Asian materials. To me this whole thing isn't making any sense at all because there are established fans across the globe, and Dragonball comic and cartoon itself has last more than TWO decades. This is why I think 20th Century Fox was putting money into this project initially. Everyone is looking forward to see a Hollywood version of Dragonball. Soon as I saw the first teaser, I knew I shouldn't put up in any hope into this movie. Even though I went to see the movie without any expectation, the movie still suck! Despite the led down of the Dragonball fans, it creates negative impulses to those who is new to Dragonball.Dragonball is a hot cult in Asia and it hits the western market because of the stylistic action and fight sequences. However, the martial arts choreography in this movie is another led down. Not to mention the screenplay, the production design of this film is not consistence at all. Wardrobes, props to makeup, nothing fits together! Not only nothing in this film resembles the original DB, it is a disgrace. No wonder they use the word ""Evolution"". But when they say evolution, I don't expect the studio turns something respectable like Dragonball into rubbish. I've seen a live action version of Dragonball shot by the Malaysian years ago. Although it is an exact duplicate of the animation. But the movie is far better than Dragonball Evolution. A lot of us are looking for a remake of this movie.",Negative
762,"As bad as Inspector Gadget and The Last Airbender are, they look like masterpieces compared to Dragonball Evolution. The TV series was very, very good, the movie was half-baked and bland. The only good thing was James Marsters, while he mayn't look exactly like Piccolo he at least tries to capture the essence of the character. Just a shame he isn't in enough of the movie to elevate it even more.Why do I say that Dragonball Evolution is a contender for the worst live-action film for an animated TV series? The scenery and costumes are nice to look at, but the cinematography does nothing for me, the editing is shoddy and the lighting is dull. The special effects don't impress either, they do distract rather than enhance and it doesn't help that some of them are half-baked.The film is also too rushed, and in all honesty I was left bored by the end, nothing really interesting in my view happens. The story is juvenile and predictable, the dialogue is terrible either being cheesy or due to the delivery very rarely ringing true and the direction is bland. The acting is nothing to smile about, Goku and Yamuka especially are complete disasters and show a complete lack of acting ability. Not only that, the characters here are treated in the most banal way possible and are difficult to like as a result.Overall, a very poor movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Negative
763,"This Movie plain and simple insults our intelligence, I mean I'm no Geek, but tham they were way off!, this should not even be called dragonball, because of stupid 20th Century Fox, now dragonball is ruined, if someone wanted to make a better movie with the real story that Akira Toriyama made, they made so many changes and mistakes that the dragonball that we know is gone forever, on Watchmen they made some changes but only so the essence of the show could be shown on film, but Dragonball is dead they killed it, I'm sorry Akira Toriyama they ruined your work and about every Anime , and dbz fan out there, like my Grandfather just to say ""there's cheese all over that movie"" It is illogical to spend the money on copyrights if you're not even going to use the story.Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network, originally disgusted at Otaku decrying the film via leaked set shots and trailers even before the movie was released, gave the movie an overall F grade, admitting that ""The fans were right."" Criticizing the films lack of explaining plot elements to its hackmead storyline and lackluster effort by the actors, he suggested that the film ""Might be fun when you're hammered and surrounded by friends. Or suicidal, and need something to push you over the edge.""",Negative
764,"Hollywood plundering Japanese pop culture isn't something new. From ""Americanizing"" television series for the kids from Power Rangers to Ultraman, and adapting famed characters from Japanese film, games and manga to frequent disastrous effect, it still wouldn't stop the studios from going after one property after another. This time round it's the long running Dragonball series, because the assumption is that the built-in fan base would translate to instant dollars at the box office. Not.You have to give the filmmakers a little bit of credit though, being either foolhardy, or just plain ballsy. It's a given that they cannot condense and distill the rich content into a surprisingly less than 90 minute movie, and live in the hopes of producing a sequel, or to generate a franchise (i.e. don't leave the cinema hall when the end credits start to roll). But what they successfully do, is to super-summarize the entire mythos by throwing out everything except the main gist of the entire manga, making it extremely simplistic in poor lazy-man standards in adaptation.For the uninitiated, the film would serve as a quick launchpad to the original manga. For those with a wee bit of knowledge of what it's about (like myself), the film just treads along the same lines and doesn't offer you new information. For the fanboys, I guess you'll only get some kicks at seeing some of your favorite characters come alive, only that they look more Caucasian, and have a head full of hair when they're not supposed to (someone forgot to insist that in the contract?) That's all you're gonna get. Period.As far as film-making and story-telling techniques go, you can see cliché after cliché being thrown at you, with the poorly and cheaply rendered special effects offering no consolation. Justin Chatwin's Goku is your typical teenager who possesses innate potential yet to be realized, and in his frustration he gets treated by peers as a loser geek. He lives with his grandpa Gohan (Randall Duk Kim in stereotypical know-it-all like in Kung Pu Panda), and develops a crush on school hottie Chi Chi (Jamie Chung). Goku's calling in life is to prevent an apocalypse from happening with the return of chief cardboard baddie Lord Piccolo (an instant shoo-in as one of the worst cinematic villains, ever!) and his temporary sidekick Mai (Eriko Tamura) who attempt to collect 7 dragonballs to fulfill an ancient myth. And of course Goku needs a Fellowship, in the form of irritating tech-wizard Bulma (Emmy Rossum last seen in the sinker Poseidon), mercenary Yum Cha (Joon Park who probably copied Rain's uninspiring cinematic turn in Speed Racer to a T) and Chow Yun-Fat the biggest name of them all here trying his darnest best to act cute as Master Roshi, who imparts skills in double quick time to Goku.Speaking of time, or the lack thereof, everything is compressed. From two weeks to two days and the day of the blood moon shielding the yellow sun (OK so I made that up), everything moves at so fast a pace, that all you get are cheesy lines of dialog, and an excuse to paste some action sequences together. And James Wong certainly can't direct action (despite being at the helm of Jet Li's The One, which was of course bland and bad), opting to pay homage to Zack Snyder's slow-mo technique, and midway changing the style to having the camera being too close to the action, in the dark, coupled with quick MTV cuts that you don't get to see a thing.And the rush job just doesn't stop at the narrative or the action. Special effects wise, they look really cheap, and I wonder whether Producer Stephen Chow would roll his eyes at what would be extremely pale when put side by side with his Kung Fu Hustle done many years ago. Ayumi Hamasaki's contribution of the theme song Rule sounded really bad as well (I may get flak from her fans), and I guess having some Asian participation doesn't legitimize what is essentially a poorly done movie. Not even Chow Yun-Fat's star status could save this, and you wonder what figured when this is the movie that he gave up Red Cliff for.This is basically a movie that only children below the age of 5 will enjoy tremendously, despite having to see 6 half-balls, contributed courtesy of the 3 lead female characters, being continuously flashed on screen, thanks to some neck plunging wardrobe (where's that malfunction when you need one?) Totally bland and really uninteresting, I would suggest sticking to the manga instead.",Negative
765,"The runtime is 1 hour 26 minutes. It is undeniably short and so you cannot expect some fantastic plot but non-stop action and some good action scenes. I would say that Dragonball has achieved being a mindless flick with non-stop action. But I must say I am a little disappointed with the action scenes and how short it is. First thing, the action and fighting scenes-they are messy and short. One fighting scene runs about 3-4 minute and they are not that fantastic. There is nothing special about the fighting scenes as some of them look messy. Even the final battle is short. I feel that it is quite short and if it is true that it cost US$100 million, it is very expensive. The special effect is not that awesome that makes you go ""Wow!"".The story: Yeah, as expected, the story is truly simple for all ages to understand. The strong point of Dragonball is supposed to be the fighting scenes but they are disappointing. The story is about Goku going on an adventure to find the seven hidden dragon balls after his grandfather tells him to before his death. From there, he needs to find master Roshi and some others company them on his quest to find the dragon balls before evil force finds them. As usual, Brian Tyler 's music is good and epic. His music makes the film more watchable.Overall: Kids will like this non-stop action adventure and the adults, depending on their taste, might also enjoy it. I have to say that I don't know much about Dragonball so I enjoyed the fun ride. Those looking for a mindless flick, may be interested in it. Those who hate plots that are lame and messy fight scenes, this may not suit you. It is slightly better than average.",Negative
766,"The entire assembly of the film crew and casting is WRONG (excluding the catering and the grip and electric guys). Asia has the first priority to watch such a bad film done by JAMES WONG. Why is he still getting work from Hollywood anyway? ""The One"" was badly done and James is just the worse director ever, I tell ya, he is walking on thin ice in the film industry. He has absolutely no vision of this film. Who hired him anyway? This film is so amateur done that it looks like student film. I can't believe 20th Century Fox distribute a student film worldwide. Btw, did they just put Stehpen Chow's name as the producer as a marketing strategy for Asia? The film ended with a hint of a sequel, and if it does, it will most likely end up re-shooting the entire film (remember of The Hulk). King Piccolo lacks of drive for him to destroy the world. Plot is flat, character drives are lame. Dialogs are stereotype. Ben Ramsey did a poor job as a screenwriter, he is lack of experience to write such an epic movie.Casting: God damn it, wrong cast dude! Carla Hool, please go back home and do some home work first! Who hired the casting department? I recall the same casting director did the Forbidden Kingdom also cast this movie -- Popping AuYeung. She sucks! Did such a bad job casting in Forbbiden Kingdom and in Dragon Ball. I wonder why is she still surviving in the industry at all. Jamie Chung tries too hard to be cute, and she is ugly. Master Mutaito is a black guy? Emmy Rossum was great in The Day After Tomorrow but not in this movie. I can assure you that it's not really her fault, James just doesn't know what he was doing. Eriko Tamura as Mai is just a redundant character, the wardrobe department tries very hard to dress her up sexy while she is not. By the way, her boobs didn't override her bad acting and ugliness. She must have missed Acting 101 class. Visual Effect: At some point of the movie, when Guko turns into a gorilla the visual effect was so poorly done that it looks some what like ""Rubber Chicken"". Did they slip in few shots done by stop motion? The face of Gozoru looks like it was done in After Effects, it doesn't look like 3D at all!! First scene of the film, Goku was training with Gohan, the matte painting of the house was so badly done that it looks 2D (cardboard stand) in the background. Blue / Green screen spill was all over, color correction sucks. Visual effect was done much like fresh grad student level. Hollywood have done so much super hero movies in the recent years, and I think the producers just hire the wrong bunch to do such a visual effects intensive film. I believe that Fox knew this film wouldn't go anywhere so they cut budget from hiring the good guys to work on this film!!!Art Design / Production Design My recommendation is to get Stephen Scott, Simon Lamont and the bunch who did Hellboy to work on DragonBall. The original DragonBall story heavily involves with aliens and action, and I believe that they are the right group of guys to do this film. Their creature designs and makeup fits in this category. Piccolo looks like alien from Mars, one of those ""Mars Attack"" films from the 60s. Costumn in the entire film doesn't match the theme at all, looks like they shop wardrobe from Wal-Mart. The story will be more interesting if it were to take place more into the future (like in the movie Minority Report). The location of Master Roshi's house is totally mismatch to the surrounding backdrop. The matte painting of the city lights and buildings doesn't fit into the picture at all. It is like cut and paste without considering the style, time and place between Roshi's house and the city backdrop.Stunts / Action Choreography: Poorly done dude! One of the marketing factor of Dragonball is the fighting style and its creative art of fighting sequence. Whatever James did, it looks worse than Street Fighter done by Steven De Souza back in 1994. Yeah, Van Damme could've star in this Dragonball movie. The ""ki"" effect is all over the place,the establish shots of the fight covered up by ""ki"" effect and I couldn't even locate the characters on the screen. They add to much vapor on the ""ki"" effect.Conclusion: If you want to have endless conversation with your friends about how bad this film is, then go watch it. I believe that Hollywood is running out of idea and beginning to tackle Asia stories. But studio got to have more faith in selling these stories with huge fans around the world: Dragonball, Akira and whatnot. If you cut back the budget, it will end up with a disaster like what James Wong did with this movie! Consider Matrix, Wachowski Bros did a total ripe off from a Japanese Animation ""Ghost in the Shell"". Look what they can achieve with the budget they've got. Of course, skills is also a factor and they have better vision than James as well.Please re-shoot this FILM!!! I can assure you that all the fans worldwide is looking forward to a re-shoot with different Above the Line and casts",Negative
767,"From looking at some of the reviews on here, I will keep mine simple as people seem obsessed one way or another. I am reviewing this film on the credits.1. Relation to the original series. 2. Quality of script 3. quality of actors/actresses/acting 4. quality of effects 5. Final product.This film bears two relations to the original. The characters and the Dragonballs. There is nothing else to link the two. This is so sad when you consider how much they had to work with and all they could produce was this. The characters also bear little resemblance to their anime predecessors. None of them do what they are supposed to do, except Chi Chi, who didn't do much anyway. Where's Roshi's turtle shell. Why does Bulma carry several fully automatic weapons? And why is Yamcha now a ladies man? To their credit though, Roshi's behaviour soon after he appears is very accurate even if it is short lived.The script for this film is its downfall. It's just awful. The writers have tried to fit too much into a short period of time. This film needed to be 2.5 to 3 hours long to even come close to allowing all the characters to be fleshed out. Attention should have been paid to Transformers when they were making this film. If you want to make a film based on a TV series, as those who watched it, not a bunch of suits that are paid to watch it and come up with a story. Many people who enjoyed the show could have given suggestions throughout the whole movie making experience.AS bad as the film was, it doesn't take anything away from the actors themselves. They did the best they could with the tools they had. If you ask a builder to build you a house out of sticks, don't complain when it falls over.This film had all the effects of an 80's movie. Think of A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors and the scene where the Freddie battles the kid in the wheelchair. That's the level of effects in this film. And I will leave the dragon, Shenron, so you come to your own conclusions. I don't want to seem prejudiced.This film lands not just way off the mark for a spin off movie, it's in another continent. They should never have made it if it was going to be so lack lustred. It could have been done with a comedy element, which would have saved it, but no. They even try to throw in romance, but you have only seen the characters for an hour so who cares. Why so many inconsistencies from the original anime series? For example, Roshi does not live on an island. All these little details could have been included with another hour of film time. No one wants to watch an 88 minute film nowadays. Its just not value for money. Some may think that 1 out of 10 is harsh, but when they made such a hash of what could have been another Transformers, its all it deserves.",Negative
768,"I saw the movie with not too much expectations.. I am one of the skeptics but for a moment there i kept a certain positivism toward the movie.The movie Is an embarrassment to the manga , the anime , the fans and above all to Akira Toriyama. When I think that the budget for that movie was of 100 Million ..i'm confused of the result.Special effects are OK they're not AMAZING they're just OK .. Acting seems out of place at so many parts ..Parts that are supposed to be taken out are not. you can not deny how bad the script was .. I mean Potentially Changing the original story that much i was OK with it because DB-Franchise is very airy so you can revamp characters and situations. However The way the story was presented SUCKED BIG TIME ..Its Amazing Cheeziness for 2009 .. But then again thats James Wong for you .I'm not really against the actors and their fitting ..they could've fit if there was a better directing .WE DO NOT WANT PART II TO BE RUINED BY WONG !! MICHAEL BAY/BRYAN SINGER ALL THE WAY!!!!!!",Negative
769,"Master Roshi, played by the great Chow Yun Fat, is the only one that seems to be competent enough to make this movie work. The other actors, are just, well, way over the top and a little too much when it comes to overacting. I mean, I haven't seen this much overacting since the opening scene of ""Mortal Kombat."" Anyways, and Justin Chatwin?! What?! Why?! Oh, yeah, that's right, Dreamworks has Shia so Fox has to have their ""it"" kid at the moment, and I guess that kid is shaping up to be Justin. Well, good luck. But not for a single second will I buy a kid that looks like him having a name like ""Goku."" *sigh* And the fight scenes -- Are you kidding me?! I mean, they jump up, and while in mid-air they slow down, turn sideways, and spin around and around and around like a screwdriver and launch themselves at each other. And then they land. Yikes. Normally, scenes like this are okay because all they do is require you to suspend your disbelief. However, in this case, it requires you to suspend any and all brain function.And let's not forget the synchronized explosions. One after another, they all go off in a succession akin to that of a typical Power Ranger episode in which the Rangers stand victorious, facing the camera, while the evil monster cries in agony in the background and explodes setting off a massive fireball along with several other explosions that just happen to come out of literally nowhere.Yes, we all know that ""Transformers,"" a movie that was based on a line of toys (no, serioulsy) was a massive success. The movie had a basic stock plot that didn't take much brainpower to muster up -- I'm a teenage kid that can't get the girl! I find magic robots! They fight evil robots! I have to help the magic robots get a magic cube! I got the cube! The evil guys are defeated! I got the girl! The end! Exclamation mark! So Fox seeing the success of this decided to tap into their own Japanese treasure chest and bring to life ""Dragonball."" Sad to say, it seems like they would have had better luck with ""Transformers"" because, unlike ""Dragonball"" which has an actual backstory to the characters, a bad ""Transformers"" movie would have illicited a response of sympathy from those that hated the movie, ""Hey, it's based on toys. That's the best they could have done."" With ""Dragonball"" and the gazillion manga volumes of it, along with the anime, there is no excuse if movie's story, characterization, or fights fail. No excuse. I mean, it's all right there in front of them. Hopefully, they did their homework. From the looks of it, no, it seems like they didn't.",Negative
770,"This was a fine movie. it wasn't great. Before I rented it I read some reviews and after I watched it I thought I should post that it wasn't that bad. Some die hard DB fans wrote they hated it. Wasn't mad that I spent a dollar to watch it or that it took 2 hours of my life. One of my favorite movies was transformers. I am a gamer but not a db fan. This movie is good one to watch on HBO or rent for a dollar at the r box. If there is nothing on then I would watch this by myself late at night. Don't think I would watch it more than 2 or 3 times though. Not one to put in your collection of DVD's. If you have kids they might like it, there is no blood or naked girls. a little violent but nothing we haven't seen in other fight movies or game movies. I liked the special effects. It wasn't too long. You don't need to know the story to like the movie. The acting wasn't too bad and the girls were cute.",Negative
771,"I almost vomited when I saw the preview for this movie. It's like taking a child, raping it and then throwing out of a moving car at 80 mph and leaving it for dead. Did anyone in the making of this movie even watch one episode of DB, DBZ, or DBGT? Special places in hell are reserved for asses like this. For one, the whole base of the story is completely off, not that it makes a huge difference because the acting alone is enough to make even the smallest of fans to the Dragonball universe cry and hang their heads in shame. This is nothing but a baseless rip off of one of the most celebrated anime classics and unfortunately more and more movies are heading in this direction. Can we please get a director with a set of balls to direct a movie based on the actual characters and plots of the story they are trying to show?",Negative
772,"My childhood is ruined. I have witnessed the death of a beloved franchise millions have come to adore and respect. This movie is not an adaptation, nor is it an homage of any sort. It is a mockery. A sheer insult to all those whom cherish Dragonball deep within their hearts and souls.Why does this video-tape recording (I absolutely refuse to deem it 'film' status) fail to such a devastating degree? It does not capture any of the charm, wit, excitement, humor, or bad-assery to be found in its source material. James Wong has simply taken the title, characters, and... errm, hairstyles, and has furtively stapled them to the bloody forehead of a poorly scripted, heavily underdeveloped movie about collecting seven golden balls that when gathered, will summon a flying dragon who will grant you one magical wish! How fantastically whimsical!Who cares.There is nothing compelling about this film. It's painstakingly difficult to care about any character in this film, and that goes for Goku as well. Right from the get-go, you bare witness to a horribly underwhelming fight session between Goku and his Asian(?) grandfather Gohan, who carries a bizarrely flawless American accent.. go figure. The reason I imply confusion behind Gohan's Asian ethnicity is that his grandson Goku is, well... nevermind. It isn't even worth getting into; the casting for this movie made no sense. No consistency whatsoever. Disgusting.The dialogue is cheesy and executed improperly in every way conceivable. You want cheesy dialogue done right? Go watch the Wachowski brothers' Speed Racer released last year, truly a masterpiece as far as anime adaptations are concerned. What is improper about it, you inquire? It causes you to cringe without the ability to hold back. Every single word muttered is a bleak reflection on each actor's terrific inability to act in any way, shape or form.Speaking of form.. Don't even expect half a thrill from this movie's excuse for action sequences. These actors cannot fight under any set of circumstances. The wirework is so blatant and poorly imposed that I swear to have caught eye of a couple unedited out wires left in some of the more acrobatic scenes.Really? Come on, Hollywood. Come on, Fox.These sort of mistakes became a thing of the past DECADES prior. If a movie based on the almighty Dragonball franchise is going to suck this severely OUTSIDE of the fight sequences, at LEAST refine those few scenes (Dragonball's saving graces, so to speak) into something worthy of admission price. Get a couple professional choreographers on the set to help out, if you don't mind. (what a strange and unusual concept, huh!?) I've said it before and I'll say it again; if this entire project had been up to the legendary Stephen Chow, we could have had a sheer masterpiece on our hands. (refer to Kung Fu Hustle, what I believe to be the most faithfully Dragonballesque live action movie ever made) I shall continue no further. This movie does not deserve any longer of a review. In fact, slice this eloquently written verdict in half and it would still be far too flattering in length.I feel that if FOX wishes to maintain any credibility they have left with their audiences, they will hold back on dumping this atrocious landfill upon the United States' precious array of cinemas. Of course, we know this is not realistic.It's nice to dream.",Negative
773,"I don't understand how people can consider this movie to be part of the dragonball franchise. Taking MAJOR characters out IS NOT a MINOR adaptation, it is just plain stupid. This movie is just fox trying to make a quick buck and they don't care what they rip off. I'm a HUGE fan of Toriyama and when i heard that he isn't even involved in the writing of the movie i STARTED to have doubts. When i saw the first trailer and i heard gokus character say ""I don't think i can do this"" I pretty much lost all faith in the movie. It's an insult to toriyama it's an insult to the franchise and it's an insult to the fans of the dragonball series. Goku is a highschool student while in the series he'd never even met a girl before. In the series he didn't even know the meaning of the words ""give up"". Minor adaptations i can handle but this is just plain sad...",Negative
774,"Well I am a huge fan of this franchise growing up with Goku and Gohan. This was really interesting to see the characters come alive.Bad Points: 1. What is with the sets??? Really poor direction and the set decoration is totally weird. You get the feeling of a cheap B grade movie all the time.2. The actors try really hard to save the movie and in the attempt sometimes overdo it. Especially Chow Yun Fat, didn't expect that such a good actor will not be able to handle Roshi's role (which is very funny) but here we get only a few smiles that's all. 3. The end sequence though good ends up pretty soon. Also the transformation does not last much.(You will know once you see the movie)Good Points: 1. The powers and the dragon are cool as usual and with the characters build so well there is no doubt that lot of people will like this movie.2. The flow of the story is true to the Series and there is a hope that the future movies will have more.3. The pace of the movie is good and the ones who are knew will for now be happy with the action and the speed of the movie. 4. The character changes to Goku makes him more real and the acting is surprisingly good from an actor with very less movies under his belt Justin Chatwin did justice to his role for most of the part.I will give it 6 because of the look and feel of the movie.The movie is good overall but do not expect a Peter Jackson's styled masterpiece here :)",Negative
775,"This movie is an abomination and a disgrace to the great anime and manga. The acting is crap and the whole thing is really cheesy, but the worst thing above all are the creative differences made. I am a big fan of the original dragon ball and dragon ball z anime and it is pretty clear what the main flaws are. First, the completely left out Krillin, a central character of the manga and anime. Second, none of the characters look ANYTHING like the did in the source material. They also changed MAJOR parts of the storyline, etc. It's just BAD.I'm pleased to know that the advertising of the movie is pretty damn bad. The less non-dragon ball fans who know about it, the better. I don't want this film to taint dragon ball's reputation.",Negative

I would be very surprised if the director even had read the manga himself...Dragonball is the one manga who made it's way to the western countries and open the way for other big mangas as Naruto, Bleach, Death note and many more. The Dragonball manga is not only before its time in many ways but also very amusing and always has a got plot and amazingly good designed characters. I really hope no one buys this movie, just to show Hollywood that we don't want your greed hands on epic tales like dragonball... Whats next then, well hey lets take the no 1. manga at the time, Naruto and put some bad acting actors in the movie and lets put an ending to the manga thats not even finished... thats sound great man, much much money there to get.All i have to say is SHAME on you Hollywood... Try to get back the glory you ones had and don't do it by trampling on millions dedicated fans..

778,"Reading the reviews, it's possible to think that this is regarded as bad purely because of a vocal fan-base for the original. For instance, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a good film, but thanks to a small group of noisy 'fans' a lot of the reviews online are negative. This is not the case here. I have never seen/read the original, and I still found this to be a bad film. The CG effects look like something from a SyFy original, the acting at times is reminiscent of Neil Breen, and the whole thing comes across as a goofy mess trying desperately to look like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. If you enjoy bad films like I do, it's worth a watch as it will make you laugh at how bad it is. 2/10",Negative
779,"It gets done wrong then have to wait another 10 years for someone to come and do it right. This has potential to be a great movie and introduce a whole new audience to DragonBall.

Not point starting the character young to build up to future movies if the first movie is at risk of flopping.I'm sure will be a nice movie, but nice movies don't get remembered and turned into sequels. Well that is not totally true, for some reason some people tend to make average movies into less than average sequels. But also the reverse does happen.

781,"A young boy named Goku (Justin Chatwin) sets out upon his grandfather's dying request to find the great Master Roshi and gather all seven Dragon Balls (of which he has one) in order to prevent Piccolo from succeeding in his desire to use the Dragon Balls to take over the world. The movie itself wasn't all that bad but the direction and the cinementography was way off. Csting was so-so, Justin Chatwin being one of the main and so was Emmy Rossum. I was surprised to spot Ernie Hudson among the cast. So overall the movie passed my liking, being greater than that cheesy Street Fighter movie that came out this past February. Dragonball Evolution 6/10",Negative
782,"Okay, let me start by saying. At age 8 I found out about Dragonball, I watched the entire season, all the way into the uncut fully Japanese airing of Dragon Ball Z, and then segued into GT. I am 23 now and have long stopped caring about anything ANIME. However, when I caught wind of this, I ignored all the e-chiming in my forums and IM's and immediately located the trailer. Needless to say I laughed and thought it was another Prank (like the Zelda trailer back in 07).So, with that said, know, this is coming from someone who nerded out to Dragonball series for years, and have long since grown out of that liking into almost disliking the entire thing. However I was drawn to check it out anyways.This movie, is probably the worst series -> movie ever made. This movie is good to use to make other movies grand. Ever want to push through a horrible movie just to say you watched it? Well kill two with one stone, watch this one, then go watch the other and you'll have such a biased stance on films in that moment you'll love it. Dragonball Evolution fails on every point.So before I dismantle this movie, I will note one good thing about it. It had: Emmy Rossum. Granted, her role wasn't classy like her other ones, but she is a nice actress to come across, and she brought back sexiness combined with duel wielding pistols.So for the non-nerd people who may go see this for any other reason than ""being a fan (or old fan) of the show(s)"". This movie fails at being anything worth a fighting or action movie. There is one cool fight scene, and I promise you, you can save time and just go watch the clip of The Forbidden Kingdom fight of JC and JL.Sorry, but watching a pasty white boy doing karate is actually insulting to my own eyes. I almost gave up on modern American Kung Fu movies when I saw Forbidden Kingdom, but after watching that weaselly looking Gokou, I have officially given up. We can only hope that Stephen Chow makes another movie soon to give us hope that China is still in the race to make Kung Fu movies.The graphics of this movie reminded me of the bulky techno special effects from Super Mario Brothers. Yea, the one with John John Leguizamo. The energy fights were anything but spectacular. Want an idea of what they looked like? Go watch that Covenant Movie (yes, the one about male witches being cool, right?). Remember the end to that movie with the energy ball fight? Well add blue and red to those balls and there you have it. But dare I say - THE COVENANT MAGICAL FIGHT was more intense, and better done than the DRAGONBALL ENERGY FIGHT.Also, when the characters would produce intelligence on the plot and foreground to background of the history of this world they live on, it sounded worst than your 10th grade history teacher teaching you about Sumatra. It was as if the actors were holding their scripts in their own hands and reading right off of it. Luckily, Rossum, didn't do any explaining, so her image is at least not so tarnished from this movie.Finally, for those wondering, isn't Dragonball from Asia, and don't all the characters from the first and second series have Japanese related names. (I say first and second as Pan and Bra don't really fit). However in this movie, there's only 4 Asian characters. The rest of the characters look like they got lost on their way to the MEAN GIRLS 2 set. (No, there isn't going to be another one. Sorry.) As for old school fans of the Anime. As you can read, this movie lacks anything cool for any outsiders view. The fighting is horrible, the graphics are lame, the acting is atrocious. As for comparing it to the show? They got the characters names right, and that's about it.Just watch the trailers and teasers. You'll be able to see. Even the profound KamehameHa move sounds like it is done by a pubescent teenager.Avoid this movie, at all costs.Note the director's name, avoid that as well.",Negative
783,"Remember the day you were exposed to the cinematic brilliance of There Will Be Blood,the great character study of Scorsese's Taxi Driver,the unbelievable quirkiness and charm of Magnolia, well,you better be forgetting them because Dragonball:Evolution is coming through and it will blow more than one mind.What you have here is a movie so emotionally devasting,that you will feel the need to be hit(twice if needed) by your friend if what you're seeing is actually real, this movie challenges the viewers to come up with their interpretations just like David Lynch's Eraserhead, The Holy Mountain and the mind-screwing Neon Genesis Evangelion(hopefully Fox picks up the rights of the show, so we can have another carefully crafted masterpiece like this one),the story is nothing short of riveting almost as good as Karate Kid and Kung-Fu Panda combined together-""Goku is a social misfit(just like he is in the anime) who gets bullied by the token black-guy and can't get the girl(just like in the anime - it feels like you are being wrapped into it)then his grandpa Gohan is killed by Piccolo(the aftermath of his death didn't feel exactly like Uncle Ben's death in Spider-Man, which was a relief cuz I had a weird feeling it would be similar)then Bulma appears and takes him to this guy Roshi,and then they go on to some cannon searching the so-called dragon balls,all right, and then they find Yamcha, cool, and hip as always with his funny one-liners,then he falls in love with Bullma and then Piccolo pops out, and the final fight between good and evil begins,they fight on and on and on... then in the middle of the fight Goku feels the need of taking a du... er... he transforms in some sorta ManBearPig-like monster(nice reference to South Park) called Ozaru and then Piccolo takes full-control of him or whatever I didn't pay much mind since my eyes were blurry from some of the action scenes and tears of joy of this tour-de force experience, some people may complain on how the story was shortened and rushed,but hey, it's not like you actually know your stuff, let the talented-one get it right,as cramming everything together in 90 minutes was the most obvious thing to do -DUH,the characters are so complex as they unfold throughout the movie,kids may have a hard time watching this cuz of the PG rating because the movie relies way too much on social commentaries against our society and the way we see life - for instance- the scene where Yamcha stars to talk out that cool-sounding stuff is obviously taken off from the harsh-times our economy is going through, you might be fooled on this one since Dragon Ball or Dragonball(whatever you may like to call it) was meant to be kiddy show, but here they kid you NOT.The character are a little different from their anime counterparts but it doesn't matter at all especially considering how you can actually connect with them in a emotional and witty way albeit complicated manner, we have Goku, brilliantly-written I must say though, lines such as ""teach me how to be normal"" and his awkwardness throughout the high-school scenes were a delight to the human eye, and kept me on the edge of my seat in an infinite loop of awe, Bulma, well, was a b... interesting character and so are Roshi, Chi-Chi, Yamcha - who were too depth for my own good though. And those nice-looking monks(so happy that Bill Murray was somehow injected in the scene), now let's get back to Piccolo, his motive is unknown, we don't what he really wants... destroy or control the world, that's the question, right? In my humble opinion I think it's up to the viewer to answer these questions just like what happened with The Joker in The Dark Knight so that makes it intriguing by default(and very cool, too). Nothing about this masterpiece felt like a cop out, I swear."" The battle scenes are (Y)AWWW-MA-ZZZZZZZZZZZ-ING, I'm not kidding you. One can notice that the idea for them definitely didn't come straight from Spider-Man or The Matrix, the cinematography was beautiful shot I may have collapsed during the movie because of its beauty, thankfully I was revived by the doctors in the theater who were bitting their own nails out of the pure excitement to see this ""legend"" come to life. At the end of the movie my whole-theater had a mad orgasm that could have been heard in the whole galaxy. I'm more than hopeful that this movie will beat the poop out of TDK and Titanic at the box-office and will spawn more sequels than Police Academy and The Land Before Time combined. After this movie I am proud to say that Tom Rothman is god, the way he rushes project... whoops, I mean the way he picks up franchises randomly and put them into production as fast as he can so the fans don't have to wait any longer without looking for a extended profit, he is a very kind individual, a man worth of trust, and we should all be thankful for that, may Jebus bless yer little caring heart.I AM also so glad that my children will grow up with movies like this and not those overrated Miyazaki's movies which are boring and lame besides every single movie(released or yet-to-be-released) will fall flat in comparison to this milestone of cinema. Especially taking into account that it takes place in a culture blinded by Kayne West, Fergie, Crapformers, American Psycho...For my money THE SINGLE BEST MOTION PICTURE OF THIS CENTURY. Still, Isn't that great that everyone's children will grow up with this sincere and honest movie. Kamehaha-IT.",Negative
784,"The only good part of this movie is when Goku said ""it's Goking time"" and just absolutely goked Piccolo. Holy cow, I still have massive chills from that. That here, is truly one of the scenes in cinematic history.In all seriousness, the movie's terrible. I do NOT recommend this.This is unfaithful to the excellent source material, the character designs are inaccurate and looked awful. Despite being a 30 million dollar budget film, the costumes and well, the visuals as a whole, look absolutely terrible.And don't get me started on the abilities.Example: AIR BENDING?!?! I'm sorry, is this Dragon Ball or The Last Airbender?!?!With all that said, avoid this movie at ALL COSTS.If you've seen this movie, I am so sorry and I hope you recover from the atrocity you have just witnessed.",Negative
785,Even when you see this movie has nothing else than a movie.It's just plain bad.Was not feeling any synergy between the actor.Yes some special effect are amazing . You expect some decent part when someone waste 100 millions dollars into anything.We know that some stuff can't be brought in the big screen.Especially with reel actor.That why there's anime in the first place.But at least try.Especially if you waste that much money into something.They clearly dedicated this movie toward kids.But the problem is a lot of people that love dragonball are actually quite old.People that grew up with such anime and won't ever forget the epicness of such series. It's like all those crappy video game based on movie.Why they are horrible?Simply because they don't take their product seriously.This is exactly what happened with this movie.,Negative
786,"After seeing this one, all I can say is that for some reason they needed a film to flop. At the moment I can't imagine what kind of tragic loop hole in the studio fiscal numbers could have prompted them to do this but I pose the question; why Dragon Ball?!! If for some reason this film was the result of poor research and disregard for authenticity, then both Ben Wong and mainly Ben Ramsey should be stung up by their feet and pelted with bile and human waste. It doesn't even help that they added evolution instead of Z which would have really spawned a violent reaction from a large fan community. Hands down, already one of the top 4 worst film adaptations ever made. Don't waste your money or time on this slovenly ball of Hollywood horse manure. I still don't know why or who gave this film the green light. I mean GOKU IS CAST AS A WHITE TEENAGER IN HIGH SCHOOL!!!! That to me is an indication to forget this film ever existed. This is definitely a bad move for Dune Entertainment. I'd say try the Wolverine film instead of this crap. But even so, why have any faith with the same group the messed up Max Panye, and made X-Men 3. Ha! I don't care if they read this, they need to anyway. DANIEL KAHN NELSON",Negative
787,"This movie made me so angry, I joined IMDb for the sole reason of writing this crappy review.This was the worst movie I have ever seen.I left the theater very, very depressed.Every single person in involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves.The acting was horrible, the dialogue sucked, the story was as stale and rehashed as... I don't know... day old hashbrowns? Look, either they put together a team that can do this movie justice, or they get the people that did FFVII Advent Children and Resident Evil: Extinction to do a CGI version.Bottom line, this movie was, from start to finish, DEPRESSING AS HELL. The original cartoon (especially the original Dragon Ball series) was incredibly funny and upbeat. I never saw Goku getting put down or picked on.This is just typical Hollywood thinking that if they water everything down for the lowest common denominator they'll generate the most revenue. Hopefully the next team to undertake a project of this magnitude will give it the RESPECT it deserves and not give us more D-list Hollywood GARBAGE.",Negative
788,OK i wonder if the people in Hollywood realize that one they !@#$ed up the story so badly that any true dragon ball fan will be outraged by this film and never go see it. you cant go and make your own spin off of a series that is one of the most popular anime on earth. plus the way this movie looks it should be a straight to DVD movie and hope to get money off the people that don't know any better. any true dragon ball fan should just pretend that this movie does not exist and refuse to see it. and those people who think that his movie has a chance in hell to be good should just not speak. this movie will destroy the series just like dragon ball GT after this movie is released you can kiss a comeback of dragon ball good bye,Negative
789,"OK. From the time I started watching Dragonball it was a very good cartoon. And what the creators did is wrong. I feel if you are going to make a movie based off a series of anime, I say please watch the anime first. It will give you knowledge about the characters and you can create a better storyboard. The Dragonball series has been out for 30 years, and from what I have seen from this movie, you did the exact opposite. To the people who have not seen the series...watch it first and understand what is happening, so when you see this bad creation of a movie you will understand what has been done. Im sorry but I am unhappy with this film.",Negative
790,"Having no idea of and no interest in the original anime upon which this spin-off film was based, I sat down hoping for a mildly diverting Asian-influenced fantasy saga. What I got was a soulless cash-in with pitiful production values, an absolutely abhorrent script and an over-reliance on cheesy CGI effects over the 'niceties' of quality acting, characterisation or plot.The cast are abysmal and I had to feel particularly sorry for Chow Yun-Fat, who's utterly embarrassing in the expositionary role of the wise old monk. Emmy Rossum once showed promise as PHANTOM OF THE OPERA's Christine, but this type of movie is NOT a good career move. As for Justin Chatwin's lead, well, he's just a spiky-haired prat. Elsewhere, there's an endless combination of leaden dialogue and terribly OTT fight scenes between mutating monsters and humans with superhuman powers. Director James Wong once produced THE X-FILES and directed two FINAL DESTINATION films, but on the strength of his work here I'd say his talent has long since left him.",Negative
791,"I have been waiting to watch this movie since I heard that 20th century fox were making this it.I didn't really care about who they cast in the movie or who was directing the movie, all I really cared about was that this movie should not be disappointing and after seeing the movie for myself and not judging it by what other people have said in their reviews I can say it's a wicked movie.There are some points in the movie that I can say need to be redone but overall the story was catchy and the action even if it was short it was good. The most disappointing thing about the film was the misuse of the oozaru and the short timing of the end battle between goku and piccolo.Overall the movie was good and it kept me entertained and still I think it was worth the wait the movie soundtracks and music are excellent and I think the cast did a pretty good job playing their characters, the best performance has to be Chow Yun Fat, he did a awesome job as master roshi and roshi kept me laughing quite a bit and also Joon Park did a wicked job as Yamcha, he sounds just like the cartoon character which was amazing. Justin Chatwin try to do his best as goku and he did make me laugh a bit but he was just too serious and the Goku I know is funny and carefree.Emmy Rossum and Jamie Chung were good as Bulma and Chi - Chi and James Marster made a wicked piccolo but his time in the movie was short and kind of reminded me of Vemon's amount of time in spider-man 3 but piccolo was another good thing about the movie.This movie is not going to be the best movie of the year or win any Oscars but it's still fun to watch and enjoyable and I seriously recommend this movie to true dragonball fans who actually know the meaning of adaptation and don't mind a bit of change in something you liked for years.My rating 8 out of 10",Negative
792,"James Wong should not be allowed to direct again . His arrogance towards the beloved Japanese Anime and Manga is such a slap in the face for all fans of the Series .For one thing Goku is not a Human he is a Saiyan from another world (and in the early dragonball had a tail) , Bulma was a tech genius , not a fighter . Chi Chi was a Goku's love interest(and wife in later times) and was daughter to the Ox King . Krillin where was he ??? Gokus best friend. Roshi was a dirty old man in the series and had a turtle shell on his back . I could go on , but , I suggest for any Dragonball fan , just , not watch this movie .",Negative
793,"Dragonball is arguably the best manga/anime ever made. It has an immense amount of popularity that has transcended cultures and become a profitable mainstream commodity worldwide. It has stood the test of time and has been a great inspiration to so many after it.With that said, this movie is a travesty to the product name. The rich characters and carefully crafted story of the manga are carelessly shotgunned onto the screen. The dialog is poor, the acting never gets any better than what we'd find on a mediocre evening kids show, the CG bounces unevenly between barely passable and awful, and most importantly, the fight scenes (and lack of) just plain stink.Dragonball has always been about being epic and larger than life. One glance at the cartoon would demonstrate how they would spend a ridiculous amount of time on building up a fight and then pay it all off with a great one. The manga was always about fantastical ideas, crazy fighting styles, even crazier special moves, and the all important which fighter is stronger debate that was made exponentially better once power levels got involved in DBZ. Simply put, none of this magic was brought over, and too much time is spent on things Dragonball was never known for. Dragonball was never about romance, as it was about family, friendship, and respect.In fact, the Goku/Chi Chi relationship was never emphasized in the comic and always took a back seat to the important matters at hand, like saving the world and working together to accomplish that. The film must have spent like 25% of the time trying to build up this relationship when the manga might have spent 0.1%. I honestly do not believe this kind of lowest common denominator to attract the interest of the female audience was necessary at all. Dragonball never had trouble creating a fan base, so this really feels like one of the many big missteps of the film.In terms of the characters, they really made a mistake in blending the young and old Goku of the original story, which resulted in one that just seems unlikable. Goku was always a bit goofy and was certainly flawed, but he was never a dope like the one we see here. People not familiar with the manga will probably come off with absolutely no idea why Goku is so well adored by all the fans. Next, the ultimate bad boy Piccolo is completely underused with very little screen time. Yamcha is nothing like the one we know, and is made to be a bad comic relief of some sort. Chow Yun Fat's Roshi is close to unwatchable. You cannot blame Chow Yun Fat for trying his best, but he's just a terrible miscast for the role. Fat does the cool stuff well, but this stuff just isn't in his nature, and it shows. Rossum's Bulma actually comes off alright and is probably the best character adaptation out of all of them. She looks great in the role and does pretty much everything you'd expect out of Bulma.Dragonball is the crown jewel of the manga/anime business, which makes it only that much more disappointing that the people involved with this film clearly did not understand what people liked so much about it in the first place. It plays like a B-movie with D-class quality in everything except budget. Fortunately, Dragonball is just too big for even this big tub of junk to cause any long lasting hurt to the franchise.",Negative
794,"I'm not going to waste anymore time to write a long, full review of this movie after already wasting 90 min. of my valuable time. In one line I can say- this movie sucks. Everything in this movie is bad. The entire cast was wrong, acting was poor and visual effects totally unconvincing. The story was very shallow and failed to leave any impression. At one point, I started laughing by seeing a black man acting as a buddhist monk in a remote mountain. In the end, I left the theatre aghast with myself and admonishing myself for making a such a poor choice. If you guys really want to know what a real bad film is, then you should watch this movie otherwise not.",Negative

I thought it was going to flow well with Dragonball this movie is a distracts to all Dragonball or DBZ fan around the world. I was sad when I saw it made me thing a group of high school kids could make a better move then this. now it sound like I'm totally dissing this movie and i am I would not pay to see this movie. this movie should end out with those Atari 2600 ET games.",Negative

Oozaru was a disciple of Piccolo!? Piccolo looked like The Mask! Goku was so unsure of himself and his abilities it was sickening. ""I have to have faith in who I am,"" give me a freaking break! Master Roshi lives in an apartment building!? Bulma is a gun-toting bad ass!? Yamcha can't even fight!

I have been waiting for a DB movie to come out and the day it comes out it's like all my dreams went down the drain. Who ever allowed to make this movie needs to get fired and everyone else!!!! Everything was low budget, the characters were dumb, and everything else was out of reality (in the DB world)!!!!... I am sure that everyone else agrees that this movie should be taken out of theaters and be burned till no more copies exist A new movie needs to come out by someone with money and people that are actually in shape!!! Not regular people and what is it with all of this old time praying things that are from the past a energy ball comes from energy not from anywhere else all of the energy balls r totally fake here I have seen LIL Kids in YouTube make better energy balls out from a room and a laptop I believe that I could of made a better movie myself if I have the time and equipment to do it.",Negative
798,"Who said little green men don't exist? According to James Wong they do and, according to James Wong, they make excellent baddies. He couldn't be more wrong, as our antagonist ""lord Piccolo"" makes his way onto the screen, without a flowing introduction, several sly laughs Eco around the cinema as I hear from one corner ""Do I have to sit through 90 minutes of this"". Fortunately, with the movie opening nationwide tomorrow you still have hope of saving yourself, Lord Piccolo is the very least of this movies problems I assure you. I've heard from fans of the series, a series which i don't watch, that the movies follows the story reasonably closely. Now it's clear why I didn't watch the series. The plot is paper thin a mere excuse for an onslaught of cheesy on liners and attempts at wetting our appetite for the painfully obvious twist that's clear a mile off. You'd think that the director of ridiculous but tense thriller ""Final Destination"" would be able to conjure up the same tongue in cheek playfulness with this. And yet any sense of self ridicule is miles away, it feels almost as if Wong thinks he is making a good movie. So for a good hour and a half we are subject to colors thrown at our face, some of the worst direlogue I've ever had to sit thorough and acting that would shame Keanu Reeves.James Wong adapts the rich mythos of the Dragonball series that grew from a manga into various popular animated series with this 20th Century Fox production starring Justin Chatwin. The plot revolves around Goku (Chatwin), Earth's greatest champion, who must defend the planet against an invading race of alien warriors hell-bent on dominating the universe. Wong directs from his own script, with Kung Fu Hustle's Stephen Chow producing. Buffy the Vampire Slayer's James Marsters co-stars as the film's villain, Piccolo, with Jamie Chung playing Chi Chi and Emmy Rossum portraying Bulma. Hong Kong legend Chow Yun-Fat rounds out the cast as Master Roshi, Goku's mentor in the film. The story develops at a breakneck pace, granted there is little story to develop, while its good to know the movie is so short, the less of it you have to endure.Think back to this time last year, a certain manga adaptation was released under the name ""Speed Racer"" this hard, cold, emotionless shell of a movie sported the same recycled material that Dragonball Evolution does. It's nothing but cutsie visual jokes mixed up with some of the worst dialogue in film history. Our protagonist delivers this line with a stale drone ""I am Goku. I am Oozaru. In order to defeat you, I must be one with myself"" and it's only downhill from there. The acting is all over the place ranging from the over eccentric Master Roshi played by Chow Yun-Fat (who really needs to fire his agent) to the mellow underused Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) who is by far the best actor present. Though I'm not sure whether or not to blame these actors of to blame James Wong for the way he directed them. I've seen each and every person here gives great performances in different movies and it is possible for them to deliver dialogue without sounding like a reject from Street Fighter.Verdict: Tearing through its mystical, who-gives-a-toss storyline like a drunk bat bouncing off cave walls, Dragonball's cocktail of cheap effects, eye-rolling clichés and dismal direlogue will have fans of the series condemning it as a beyond-lame failure. Dragonball: Evolution is so lazy and cheap in every aspect of its execution that the end result is almost unwatchable. It's clear no effort has gone into yet another Fox production - The Day the Earth Stood Still anyone? - why anyone would pay to this is beyond me, if your forced however, make sure to order the nachos cause there's plenty of cheese. For my overall rating I give Dragonball Evolution 1/5.",Negative
799,I have been a Dragon Ball for my whole life. I just saw the movie for the first time just for the memes. This is the single most offensive movie I have ever seen in my life. I feel really terrible for the actors who'll now have this in their biography for their entire life.,Negative
800,"This was a great movie, even for a true Dragonball, DBZ, DBGT fan. The acting was ~alright~ (Ive seen worse!) They changed the plot a little~ but thats what needed to be done and it was set right! The effects were awesome! I though it was a very good/(genius?) way to incorporate Dragonball into a live action film and hope there is enough fan base for there to be more (wishing for a trilogy! at the least!) As a fan of Dragon Ball and after watching this movie I've started re watching all the episodes of it all starting with #1. I hope this isn't the end of the live action version cause it puts a lot of things into a more real perspective. I give this film 2 thumbs way up!",Negative
801,"I've been hearing about how bad this movie was for the last 14 years and upon finally seeing it tonight I was... actually kind of charmed by it?I don't think it's a good movie. But it walks that fine line of, like, the 1993 Super Mario Bros. Movie, where I was constantly enchanted by what pieces of the source material it chooses to be faithful towards and how it twists itself into something that resembles the shape of Dragonball while also absolutely, unequivocally NOT BEING DRAGONBALL.To put it another way, it's a very dumb, over the top movie that sometimes feels cut from a similar cloth as the Michael Bay Transformers movies, but minus all of the sleazy ""hot babe alert"" tone or obsession with cinematic hyperrealism. It's trying very hard to stay true to Dragonball while also making sure stay within the confines of mainstream Hollywood expectations, with the latter winning out in most scenarios. Its heart is trying to be in the right place, even if it's being pulled in opposing directions.But like with the 1993 Mario movie, once I let go of my ""this isn't Dragonball!"" complaints, I started having a lot more fun meeting the movie on its own weird terms, where Goku is supposed to be a normal high school teenager that gets swept up in an adventure to prevent the apocalypse.Again, just to reiterate: it's not a good movie. But I ended up having way more fun than I expected. Bare minimum, it's a strange curiosity and sometimes that's all the entertainment you need.",Negative
802,"This Movie was absolutely horrible. I can't put into words how awful the acting was, and the special effects were a joke. The story was impossible to follow for both those familiar and unfamiliar with the cartoon simply because it moved too quickly. The film was extremely painful to watch. I don't understand why Fox would let such a monstrosity into theaters.To put it blankly, it was unfit even for a straight to DVD film.In my opinion, this movie may have potential as a high school film festival entry. I would advise you all to think twice before you decide to spend your hard earned money to see this movie. By the way, when I stated that this movie was painful to watch, i meant it. Not just for Dragonball fan-boys either, the movie was literally painful to watch. I couldn't stop turning in my seat. Also, I'm not a fan-boy.",Negative
803,"Dragonball Evolution was the kind of movie a theater should pay someone five bucks to see and tell them that it sucks. The only way to improve the film would be to start from scratch and have whatever pre-teen schoolgirl that wrote that god awful story take a look at either the original manga or television series.I had hopes for it. Dragonball was the catalyst series that got me into drawing and wanting to make cartoons. This movie crushed me. I cannot believe ANYONE thought this was a good idea. Everything about this movie is just so incredibly horrible its unbelievable! The acting-Bad. The story-Bad. The special effects-BAD! Nothing about this movie was good or original. It's like star wars, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Lord of the Rings, and a cheap made for TV special all melded together to create a half hour of disappointment, agony and the destruction of childhood memories.Don't pay to see this. In fact, don't see it all because you will be crushed and angry. Remember how Southpark portrayed Lucas and Spielberg after the last Indianna Jones movie? Even comedy Central wouldn't let them air what Fox did to Goku. It's just BAD.And those of you that like this movie, or even think it's okay...don't even. Encouraging this film is like spitting in Toriyam's face.",Negative
804,"Take a childhood memory; a movie, a toy, a song, or most appropriately here, a television show. Now imagine everything you loved about that nostalgic pastime and then envision a lucky break where you were asked to direct a brand new movie adaptation of that piece of your history. And finally, ask yourself, so you think it possible to remove every single aspect that made that memory so special? Could you do it? Would you, as a fan, be literally capable? Well the people behind Dragonball Evolution certainly managed too, as they manage to drain every iota of fun, charm or wit out of a much loved series.Back when I was young I always found a great deal of fun to be found in the anime import Dragonball Z. I was by no means a die-hard fan; I watched only the first few seasons and even as a grade-schooler I could pick out consistent pace issues and gaps in logic. But yet, it was goofy, bloody, wildly inappropriate fun. It would stand to reason a director could draw at least some of the spirit of the Dragonball universe by simply watching the shows or reading the sources material and yet James Wong (who also directed The One and Final Destination 1 and 3) manages to do just that; change fun into camp, over-the-top violence into PG rubbish and alter any of the interesting back-story and lore of the series into an unwatchable tedious origin story.Perhaps I am missing the mark hugely, but vibe of the film is all off, and I assure you I am not an adaptation Nazi, nihilistically picking out every detail not identical to the source material but I just kept uttering under my breath ""What IS this?!?!"" To that end I am not sure who this film will impress. It will surely not draw in new fans, and as you may have gathered, I am of the impression fans will not be too thrilled either. The opening half of the film is droning, tedious schlock, which then gives way to ridiculous camp, which finally falls into an at least half-successful final act. There is also the possibility that Dragonball will simply never work as a live action adaptation, the anime medium just suits the feel and bizarre pleasure of the story and characters.The plot (a term I use loosely) is beyond excusable and consists merely of young warrior Goku (the fresh faced Justin Chatwin), his master Roshi (a mildly entertaining Chow Yun-Fat who must be strapped for cash) a feisty gun-slinger named Bulma (Emmy Rossum) and a creepy hippie conman named Yamcha (Joon Park). Joining forces, they seek to collect 7 mystical Dragonballs, which when brought together grant their holder one wish. But on their trail is the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters) and an assassin (Enriko Tamura). The plot suffers further from the bit part from Piccolo which leaves the story with barely a central antagonist, and the plodding pace, unforgivable dialogue and general lack of momentum compile into just a pile of rubbish.The final battle finally brings out the style of fighting most fans are accustomed too, but it's too little to late and an insane twist involving Goku is beyond cringe-worthy. The only thing Dragonball Evolution is good for curing is a leg cramp, because 10 minutes of this film and your legs will be involuntarily shuffling out of the theatre.Read all my reviews at: simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",Negative
805,"so, ii see all these people giving it negative reviews and I'm thinking, ""ya maybe they are right, but why hasn't any1 said anything about Krillin not being in this flick?"" is he not a main character in the manga/anime? i mean seriously, OK i can deal with roshi being a middle aged man, and i can deal with goku being a teenager, HELL, i can even deal with the fact that he is in SCHOOL!!!!!! but please, Krillin was his best friend, how can you leave him out of the loop? if they make a sequel, (which will be surprising), they better not have krillin in it, because now, it wont make any sense what-so-ever to have him in these movies, please please please, don't make a sequel, just make a re-make and fix this sheet.",Negative
806,"I know this is probably heresy to some of you who have seen this movie and were hoping for the ultimate Dragonball epic and were hacked off when you didn't get it, but I recommend it highly to anyone who has young boys. I took two nine year old boys, a 7 year old boy, and a 5 year old boy, and they had a great time. They talked about it non-stop for hours that evening. I went to see the movie because of the great Chow Yun-Fat, and I was able to somewhat enjoy the movie on its own terms. I wouldn't recommend thinking about it too much on the way home. I do admit that it's probably best that I didn't know much about Dragonball heading into the theater and thus I didn't have very high expectations going in. Therefore, in summary, I would personally give the movie about a 5 or 6 out of 10, but as entertainment for my boy and his friends, I give it an enthusiastic 10 out of 10.",Negative
807,"I love DBZ too and it's hard to let go of the fact that there won't be anymore drawn by Akira Toriyama. So we should be grateful that they are actually making a live action movie. It may of sucked for some people but I think they did a good job considering it must be hard to actually pull off.I think when Chi Chi and Goku settle down with Gohan, then things will start to get better. Piccolo will be Gohans mentor once Gohan survive's six months in the wildness. While in the wildness Gohan will have to defend himself against the Dinosaur just like on the anime. Unexpectedly Gohan will transform into the Ozzoro leaving Piccolo no option but to destroy the moon, or say goodbye to the earth. The two Saiyan spacecrafts will crash land on earth - I think the graphics for this will be quite amazing. Anyway I just look forward to see what they'll come up with.",Negative
808,"I'm almost glad this film exists not because it's good in anyway but because of how bad it it. And I find that the terribleness of this title has everything to do with the Hollywood studio system in particular FOX STUDIOS. Throughout the years Fox has obtained many notable franchises and completely crapped on all the mythology and character building those series had, and instead making a base level POS turd that would make them a few millions. Case in point all the Fantastic Four movies, Alien, Predator, and X-men. Now they slide their slimy hands into anime. making one of the sorriest excuses of a film I've seen in years. Yeah the characters have the same names and there are winks at the series for fans but the essence of the series is never captured and the entire film feels like western studio drivel. And honestly I find this inexcusable. Granted i wasn't expecting some great storytelling with a Dragonball movie as the show was mostly driven by the action. But come on what the hell is this movie? I hope no one pays to see this, more than that I hope no one ever sees this. I saw this film for free and wished I hadn't wasted the time. My advice steer clear of this flaming Kamehameha of $###.",Negative
809,"Dragon Ball evolution is an abomination to the history of live action anime! Dragon Ball series are the best anime of all time and what we see here is a total mess of a masterpiece! there is some nice special effect, famous and appreciated actors and actress but all the magic of dragon ball is everywhere but in this movie, Nothing is like the original, few peoples are missing and have nothing in common with the original dragon ball. This movie is more power-ranger like than what we enjoyed during our childhood, they do not deserve any money for this movie, if i could i would give it a minus 10. in fact i register here just to post this comment!!! Hollywood stay away from japan!!!",Negative
810,"When i was 10 i saw the Chinese live action version of dragon ball. it was an awful movie, it looked like if it had a budget of two thousand dollars or less. The acting was horrible and the special effects were pretty bad. It seemed like something that some fans would upload in youtube.The matter is that this movie had a budget of millions of dollars, and i still prefer the Chinese version.The problem with this movie is not the history, the problem is that it lacks of the essence of DB. I wouldn't be upset if just goku were more like a little innocent brave boy instead of a classic horny American teenager.",Negative
811,"I know everybody is saying how lame this movie is and that it's nothing like the anime,that everyone was out of character and that it generally sucked...But I beg to differ.This movie is based on the graphic novel...BASED ON!!...so it's supposed to be almost nothing like the movie.I hate how everyone thinks that a live action movie of a manga is supposed to contain every single detail,but it's almost impossible to get all that information in an hour and a half movie.So what do you do? You make your own story so it can fit the time.If the lord of the rings movies or harry potter movies contained all the details of the book then the movies would be 5 hour plus movies. I thought it was an awesome movie.It didn't portray the actual manga,but it fits more the profile of a tribute to Dragonball. So summed up this movie was a TRIBUTE.",Negative
812,"God this movie was bad, don't get me wrong I wasn't expecting a lot but I was expecting at least something worth the 10 bucks i'll never get back, after watching all the series this movie made me wanna gouge my eyes out with a hot plastic spork. I honestly felt ashamed and dirty watching this.The worst part for me was when they started mixing in CRAP from Avatar: The Last Airbender. With the Kamahameha wave being the ultimate 'AIR BENDING' technique. And Piccolo being a Fire Bender using the Oozaru form of Goku as a slave.Only good thing in this movie was Bulma, Chi Chi, and that chick w/ Piccolo, Asian boobies! They didn't even show nimbus, the kame house, Yamcha had no scar, no tien, no krillin, GOKU Doesn't HAVE A TAIL BUT CAN TURN INTO OOZARU This movie sucked. Period.

813,"Hehe.. *chuckle* I don't even know why I am writing this review. Perhaps the movie literally sucks ? Yes, you heard me sucks. Anyone who has seen the original Dragonball Z anime's probably are looking very hopefully to this movie. So did I. I went to the cinema with a few friends with loads of expectations. Didn't care if there were not-known actors. And i swear the first 52 seconds of the movie passed and I said: "" I want my money back"" But i didn't leave hoping of seeing a bit Dragonball ? No- this movie is so utterly crap I think it makes the writers of Dragonball Z cry. Extremely cheesy- acting, plot, story, this movie is 1hour 20min long what the f*ck ? It almost feels like they want this piece of misery as soon as possible. GOD THIS MOVIE IS SO SH*T. You already know what happens near the end. Everything deserves a -50/10. When the credits came I nearly shat myself. I went home sat in the sofa and watched the Original cartoons. Do yourself a favor and do the same.1/10 Abysmal.",Negative
814,"OK, first off let get this in the clear. Whenever you are going to make a film using names, items, settings, etc. from a franchise as big as DBZ you would take into account that nearly 98% of your viewers will be fans of the franchise. (DBZ) Apparently James Wong does not agree. But, hey, everyone knew withing 5 months of preproduction that they weren't going to follow the story so we all did this. We all accepted that it wasn't a DBZ movie and watched it expecting at least an OK movie considering they had a budget of *cough cough* one hundred million dollars! *holds pinkie to mouth* OK heres the serious. The movie was atrocious. It was closer to the power rangers than the z fighters. None of the characters remotely resembled the anime selves, in looks or attitudes. Even just as a movie it fails. Its like something an 8 year old would love. I wont even say 9 because my 9 year old brother watched my burned version and he hated it!Terrible acting from everyone, except Fat. However I wont defend him; he choose to do this because he had no money I'm sure. Another thing that ticked me off was in the scene where Chi Chi cant open her locker. Well first off you later find out she's a world class fighter so, couldn't she just rip it off it's hinges? Second off, Goku sees so he blows all the lockers away using his Ki energy, and Chi Chi doesn't freak out? She just replies, ""hey you used your Ki."" Even in the show, which had animals as people in it; everyone freaks out at how unreal it is when they use energy blasts.Whatever i don't care if i get deleted for this, it needs to be said. JAMES WONG CAN BLOW ME",Negative
815,"Since last year we have been receiving news, pictures, and trailers about this film and a lot of fans were disappointed 'cause the huge changes that both story and the characters were going to have in this production ... but the problem is much WORSE.In forums I've read people commenting that if this movie would have another title it would be a great movie. What a mistake. This film is so bad and so terrible that it doesn't matter its title or the character's names. How can I explain it?. The worst Power Ranger chapter is deeper and better than Dragonball Evolution. I'm very disappointed 'cause the FOX made this poor and stupid movie. I don't know how they approved it.Poor performance, a script without creativity, in fact, there's no reasons to watch it. I hope the FOX doesn't earn enough money with Dragonball Evolution in order to cancel possible sequels, but only the audience will say the last word.",Negative
816,"Goku is a high school student. He's a bit of a loser, he gets picked on by bullies, and has trouble talking to girls (especially Chi-Chi, on whom he has a crush). However, Goku has a secret. He has these powers, which make him incredibly powerful in just about every way possible. He is an orphan, and lives with is grandfather, Gohan, who trains him to fight. But he warns Goku that he shouldn't use his powers to fight schoolyard bullies, only on the great powers of darkness that are inevitably going to show up fairly soon, or else people will get bored and leave the theatre. On his eighteenth birthday, he is given by his grandfather a mysterious spherical object called a Dragonball. There are only seven of these in existence, and anyone who collects all of them will be granted one single perfect wish (I assume that means one without any conditions. So is wishing for more wishes allowed?) So anyway, Goku is distracted from his school work by Chi-Chi. Later that day, she is having trouble opening up her electronic locker (the film is set in the near future, or a parallel universe, or something like that), so, in order to impress her, he uses his powers to open it for her. This does indeed impress her, and she invites him to a party she is having that night. However a group bullies shows up at the party, and call him names. Goku, not wishing to disobey his grandfather, but still wishing to cause these people as much pain as possible, gets into a fight with them, but instead of inflicting any blows, he merely dodges the attacks made against him so that his aggressors hurt themselves rather than him. This impresses Chi-Chi further, and they talk. You get the impression that they're about to almost kiss, however the actual plot (finally) kicks in, and Goku rushes back home to find his Gohan murdered by a green alien played by James Marsters, called Piccolo. He is after the Dragonball that Goku inherited that day, so he can use it for his own evil purposes.Sound familiar? Well, it should, because there is very little, if anything at all, that is original about Dragonball: Evolution. It begins as a generic high school drama filled with clichés we've all seen a million times before, and have no real desire to see again, especially in what is supposed to be an action film. Eventually, it becomes an adventure movie, as Goku teams up with a girl called Bulma, who wants to locate all the Dragonballs so that she can be famous; Yamcha, a thief who wants to harness their power to gain immense wealth; as well as Master Roshi, a perverted, middle-aged man whom Gohan, before dying in Goku's arms (just before, of course, the obligatory ""believe in yourself, and you can do anything"" speech) tells him to locate. I believe that Gohan and Roshi were friends, or something. I only walked out of the cinema about an hour ago, and already I am forgetting what exactly the movie is about. Yes, you guessed it, they're looking for the Dragonballs, before they fall into Piccolo's sinister hands. There's not really much else to talk about that concerns the film, to be honest. There is an adventure, but you've undoubtedly seen something like it many times before (all that's different is what they happen to be looking for). There's action, but it's poorly executed (especially after the recent Watchmen, which had a similar style of action; only it, as well as the movie itself, was executed in a far superior manner). There's also romance (between Goku and Chi-Chi, as well as Bulma and Yamcha), but it's so contrived that it's laughable (a romantic scene between the former two ended with a sarcastic round of applause from the audience, myself included). The scenes that are meant to be humorous are far less amusing than the ones that are trying to be serious.While I wouldn't consider myself a fan of either the manga or anime upon which Evolution is based, these are both far superior works to this movie, and definitely worth checking out.As for Dragonball: Evolution (in case you haven't already worked it out)as far as I'm concerned, it is a bad movie. However, I would actually recommend watching it, because much of it is unintentionally amusing, and it does give off a so-bad-it's-good-vibe,But still, a movie that's so bad it's good is still, well, bad.",Negative
817,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not just a lame fan boy who is all upset because Bulma doesn't have blue hair. And I'm also not a boring troll who will sit and trash any movie he can for fun. I happen to love the whole Dragon Ball saga, and I have since I was little, but I'm also a realist and know that things need to be changed for cinema.This movie, however, is a piece of crap on so many levels.For example, I'm also a big fan of Harry Potter books. I hate the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' due to so many liberties being taken with the film. However, after re-watching it, I still have to respect that it is a good, well-made film. 'Dragonball Evolution' is just straight-up terrible in every possible sense of the word.The ""story"" here is basically, a teenager named Goku is given a mystical Dragon Ball from his grandfather. After twenty minutes of bad teen dialogue, awkward stumbling through lines and the worst back story in history, Goku sets off to find Master Roshi to alert him that Lord Piccolo has returned.Now, some of the fight scenes are decent, most of them are not (a lot of unnecessary slow-motion). That scarcely makes up for the wooden, horrible acting on display. Justin Chatwin is probably the most un-emotional actor I've ever seen. I've never met a more unlikeable hero; in fact, I hated him. Anyone who knows Goku from the television series.. Could you imagine hating Goku? Lord Piccolo is also the worst cinematic villain in history, at no real fault of James Marsters. Piccolo was scarcely in the movie, and he did nothing. Also, the way he was introduced was basically.. ""We locked up Piccolo. He's back! Aw crap"" and that was it. Piccolo also has a random girl named Mai who is a shape shifter and does all of his bidding. So, the only thing this movie really stirs up is apathy, as I couldn't even force myself to care about any of the characters.All in all, if you are the type of person who likes to watch bad movies for their comedic value, this one is priceless. From a slow motion crying scene to the most predictably bad cheesy dialogue ever, this one has it all. To be fair, Chow Yun-Fat is pretty entertaining as Roshi. Oh, and there is no shortage of cleavage shots, for you guys out there.2/10 on a film scale 9.5/10 on an unintentional comedy scale",Negative
818,"This is a Great movie!! People have to remember that this is an adaptation of the original. They called Dragonball Evolution because it is an advanced version of Dragonball. People say that Goku's saiyan heritage wasn't explained well in the film, which is why they will explain it in the sequels. Many fans say that the movie is nothing like the manga and anime. The similarities are painfully obvious, and there are many similarities(I'm not going to list them, but their are a lot). Many fans did not like this movie because of the same reasons. Goku is in High school, The story is different, the characters look different, etc. It's always the same thing. All you guys have to stop complaining. Change is necessary for a good adaptation. For example, the X-men movies, the Spiderman movies, Batman movies, Ironman, and Transformers were all different from their original versions, and look how they turned out!In conclusion, this is one hell of a movie! I Recommend it to Action fans, sci-fi fans , fantasy fans, or anyone who just wants to watch a fun and exiting movie!",Negative
819,"Edited in the quick-pacing style of many Marvel movies that would debut later, this action packed film keeps you moving along.The story is seen mainly thru the eyes of Goku, who lives with his grandpa but doesn't know where he comes from or who his parents were. His uncertain beginnings make him timid around his love interest, but the events of the film quickly propel him to grow and overcome his challenges.While it may not hold true to the original series in some ways, the movie was intended to be an alternate interpretation, and it plays well for the screen. Despite a relatively low budget, the cast of characters and special effects bring the story to life and keep watchers engaged. While it has received much critical review from the DBZ fanbase, on its own Dragonball Evolution is an enjoyable film with inspirational themes, sure to leave you with a smile.",Negative
820,"Lets start-off by saying, I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS NO ZERO RATING. This must be the worst movie ever. The fact that they are grabbing bits and pieces from all the old DB movies/series is a joke, this movie doesn't even make sense. I mean the best thing in this movie was probably the yellow dodge charger, can't think of anything else. O well thanks DB you knocked starship troopers 2 of my no.1 baddest movie ever list. I have been waiting so long for this movie that any mention of it I though yea another release date in a year or so, but when It finally arrived I nearly cried, and then after the movie I wanted to chew my ow wrist off. But yea thanks, I hope the $500 you made from this movie makes you happy. Can't someone with a Matrix budget remake this movie please!!!!!!!",Negative
821,"My expectation was really high when the news to make a Dragon Ball movie years back. I wasn't actually following the development of the movie since. And barely months ago, I seen the first trailer available for Dragon Ball Evolution. Oh man, you cannot belief my disgust. ""It's not a dragon ball movie"" screams my sub-conscious. For goodness sake, it doesn't even feel like Dragon Ball universe.Alright, I have to watch the movie anyhow (admit being a huge fan of the series minus GT). In fact, I just returned from a showing in Brisbane, Australia. Okay, I went into the theater with little expectation. Yet I was willing to bet on the tiny little possibility that I will like the film. I was like ""please.... let there be a little thing that surprises me, let there be something DBZish that I can relate to"".Let me set the record straight. I was TOTALLY DEVASTATED.....It's almost like watching yet another teenage movie, except DB characters names were used. It was like watching kung-pao and said it was a set in the ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" world. (mind you, I actually enjoyed kung pao).I think Dragon Ball Evolution will eventually become a page in history of ""what's not to do with manga"". A earlier reviewer said ""DB evolution was created for people who hate DB"". I saw that comments before watching the movie, and now I totally agrees with it.",Negative
822,"Listen, if you're going to adapt a thirteen episode season of a beloved anime into a film that is less than 80 minutes long, atleast try to capture the essence of the source material. Ladies and gentlemen, what we have here are shoddy cosplayers reenacting a script that was clearly written during a short lunch break as the writer was watching a completely different anime at the time, because sweet starry balls this was not 'Dragonball Z' at all! A white American Goku must find seven balls so that he can make a wish, which in turn will stop the evil forces of darkness. Let's re-visit some ground rules. First rule: if you are creating a western adaptation, ensure you don't succumb to whitewashing. Either have an all-white cast or not at all. Making the lead protagonist white and the supporting characters Asian is an insult to fans, audiences and the source material. Second rule: Authenticity. Stay true to the source material and don't, oh I don't know...make a complete left turn by butchering an already simple story. Third rule: cast decent actors. Not even Yun-Fat with his absurd overacting could provide a distraction from the woeful acting on display. Final and most important rule: make a good film. When the best scene of the entire film is Jamie Chung getting unexpectedly donkey kicked in the chest (unintentionally hilarious!), something isn't quite right. Goku has all the charisma of a restless sloth. The fighting sequences were plagued with half second jump cuts. The story was uninteresting and not even remotely developed. ""We need to find all seven dragonballs!"" 5 minutes later... ""the enemy have all seven dragonballs!"". Goku transforms into what looks like a werewolf, not an ape. Goku didn't care for his grandfather (still doesn't). Goku effortlessly lights a candle twice, but fails the third time. Goku beats up his future girlfriend and she doesn't care. Goku looks like a discount Aaron Paul. Goku is in this. This film is 79 minutes too long. I'm done. So, essentially, avoid this fan made film like the plague.",Negative
823,"After reading the review posted on here I decided that it was time to watch the movie. Since this person said it was horribly made, and I am such a big fan of DBZ I thought that maybe I should sign up and put my own opinion.First of all, I think that the movie started just as it should for people that have no idea what Dragonball is all about. I found the story line, acting, and special effects to be phenomenal. I personally cannot wait until the next one comes out. Obviously you have to be as big of a fan as I am to appreciate the excellent quality of this live action version of Dragonball. To wait as long as I have to see this movie the author of the main post on IMDp is obviously not a fan but just a critic that didn't do his homework and has never watched the anime version. At least not enough of the anime version to understand the storyline. This person only wanted to see huge Ka-Me-Ha-Me-Ha Waves and total destruction of cities and floating boulders from so much raw Ki power. That is not possible at this juncture of the story line, IDIOT!!!! The fight scenes, well one word- Awesome!!!! I personally suggest that anyone interested in Dragonball should watch this movie and understand it for what it is, if you know anything about the story line of the anime then you will know what I am talking about. I don't know the Japanese translation of the show however if the English dubs of the anime are in accordance with the Japanese spoken language minus the profanity then this movie is right on. This is the beginning of what I hope to be a series of great live action Dragonball movies. As always though someone from another country has a bur in their butt about the Americanized version of and over seas phenomenon.In closing I thought that the movie was great. Thanks for reading.",Negative
824,"I get why this movie is hated on so much. It, in no way, resembles the original comics or anime beyond the names, some of the concepts being loosely adapted, and that's about it. But when I sat down to watch this and expected an absolute mess of a film, I actually found a mildly entertaining comedy that felt more like a Dragonball Parody than anything else. Yes, I'm keenly aware that wasn't their intent, but when you look at symbolism in film or books, sometimes what you see is not even close to the intent of the creator, but we believe that's what we see anyway. My first introduction to Dragonball Z was the Dragon Ball Z Abridged series on YouTube, and, as such, I've never taken the series seriously in anyway because, quite frankly, the source material really isn't that good on an animation level, narrative level, or even an action level. The original series is actually pretty bland. So when we get a movie that functions more like a parody and less like that bland boring nonsense the franchise started as, yes, I can actually enjoy it that way. It's sad we can't get more of this because I had a blast watching this. My favorite movie? Hardly, but it got me to laugh most of the way through the film (probably not for the right reasons) and, as such, deserves commendations on that alone. And if you really are on of those burned fans who can't accept the humor of this film as being a completely crap-version of Dragon Ball and legitimately want a good live action Dragon Ball, just stop. It'll never happen and this will likely be the closest you'll ever actually get.",Negative
825,"The beginning looked relatively promising, but i wasn't too impressed. I was thinking that it would just improve as the movie went on, but I was wrong, very wrong.First off, I didn't like the modern setting. Why couldn't they stick to the original show? I honestly think they should just remake this movie. There were no awesome powers or crazy fight scenes. The villains also sucked. The dialog was very poorly written as well.From the start, you have very unlikeable characters. Almost everyone was very poorly cast. I thought Goku and Master Roshi were fine, but Bulma was absolutely terrible. I hated her and really wanted her to die.The ending made me very angry also. I was hoping that there would be some epic fight, but again, I was very disappointed. After this ""fight"" was over, I was left scratching my head in disbelief.Terrible dialog, awfully cast characters, and a pathetic journey and ending should have made Dragonball Evolution a straight to DVD release.And flying Hummers?

I mean are those kis? Are those kamehame? They light stuff? wow amazing... 6) The special effects are terrible. They look like Adobe After Effects7) The oozaru... LOL 8) The dragon... LOL is that Spyro? 9) The final fight scene is ridiculous 10) The ending is more ridiculous them ridiculousNow the good:1) Hot girls 2) Wait... there's actually seven dragon balls in this movie!! 3) Oh my! There's a guy called Son Goku! Just like in the anime!I advice you to not, TO NOT see this movie. You already know its bad, but you have no idea how bad it really is. Stay away from this, stay home, eat some chips and watch whatever is on television: its way better them the movie. If you watch this i bet you will regret it, like me.",Negative

Unfortunately besides Yun-Fat Chow, Justin Chatwin and Jamie Chung the rest of the cast look like the should be doing low budget Disney TV series.Story line isn't very straight forward and you will probably need to watch it a couple of times to fully understand it.The one thing you can take from this film are the fighting scenes. Better than I expected and well choreographed.",Negative
830,"This movie is an all-time disappointment! We have been waiting for years for the movie to happen. When the announcement was made to produce the movie at last, we, the avid Dragon Ball fans, were all tearing in excitement.Little did we know, we came out of the theatre after the movie preview full of resentment and grievance. To the true Dragon Ball comic fans out there, do not expect the story or characters to have major colleration to the original. Not only the story line twisted but character-play was utterly out of the way. Shenren the dragon, was really crappy. One glance at Master Roshi's flowery shirt put me off the dinner table for days. Give us back the perverted Roshi!! This movie needs a serious re-make to stay truthful to its origins and be answerable to the disappointed comic fans worldwide.",Negative
831,"Don't waste your time. Seriously.I wouldn't even bother to call this an 'adaptation'. It's more like a badly written fanfic: you know, one of those really bad 'DB characters in high school' ones.It was very fast paced and rushed, and I pretty promptly forgot most of the movie as soon as I was finished watching it (which I can only sum up as good fortune).I won't try and echo what hundreds of way more in-depth reviews written here before me have already said. I'll cut right to the chase: Don't waste perfectly good money on this piece of trash. It's not even one of those bad movies that's good for a laugh. You'll probably just wind up confused and, if you're a fan of the anime, probably more infuriated than anything.But hey. At least Piccolo was green.",Negative
832,I can not believe Hollywood even decided to make a live action of this movie to begin with. The cast do not do justice to the animation. Why cast a white person to be Japanese?!? That's extremely presumptuous.This is also one of those movies where it's solely about special effects. No real story and lack of character development. I loved the animation and for them to rip the story apart is greatly disappointing. I nearly fell asleep watching this junk. Save your time and money and go buy the animated series instead.Hollywood clearly ran out of ideas recently and are looking to profit from any idea. Highly disappointed by this movie - avoid!,Negative
833,"It was awful, I was prepared for the worsed and I think that you should rate movies on the category in which they are made. So you can't say Transformers 1 was bad, because it wasn't all bad it was okay in it's own category. But Dragonball Evolution was just all bad, acting was terrible, special effects were okay but not something for a manga spin off, more something for a action movie and this shouldn't have been an action movie but more a manga. I can understand that the story had to be modified, but in this case the totally murdered it, add extremely bad directing, bad acting and semi good effects(which are extremely bad if you reckon they had a 100 million budget) and this movie goes into my worsed movies ever right alongside 'A View From The Top'. Movies after which you get the urge to kill yourself. Go watch it but keep in mind you will waste 100 minutes of your life.",Negative
834,"This movie was so awful, i left after 30 minutes. First time i ever walked out of a movie. I came in with low expectations, but, wow, i was just blown away on how terrible this movie is. The acting was awful, chow yuan fat looked foolish and could be his worst acting i've ever seen from him. Every other actor looks like they have never seen the show before because their characters are way off. I know they tried to americanized this movie by changing the settings, but it just didn't work out at all.The effects were OK, but nothing ground breaking and nothing we've not seen before.So in conclusion, please do not watch this movie. The acting is so horrible and its absolutely nothing to do with the anime, except the names. oh man, i was so furious when i walked out...",Negative
835,"I don't know what the big deal is. I saw the movie and I didn't think it was bad at all. And you know what? I HOPE there will be a sequel. Because I LOVE Vegeta! And I think that it actually had the potential to be a good movie if people weren't ragging on it before they even saw it! I mean look at the Death Note and Sailor Moon live actions. They were WAAAAAAAY worse than this movie! So I think it deserves a LOT more credit than it's being gived. LOL Obviously it doesn't follow the story line very well but for what it does bring cheesy humor that I think all Dragonball fans can appreciate. Call me crazy or stupid all you want. But as a die-hard DB and DBZ fan I went, I saw and I am buying the DVD. ^O^",Negative
836,"If you like movies like Mortal Kombat, D.O.A Death or Alive, you should watch this I think is quite entertaining. There are nothing special with this movie but at this time with all good action movie is still waiting to come out this is worth a trip to a theater near you. What else can I say so my comment is pass the minimum lines and can be post. If you have little nephew, or son or brother between ages 7 - 12 they will like this movie, bring them along so you can enjoy more as they comment or pointing to screen. Also on the plus side the fight scene is much much better than Charlie's Angel although that not say much. Chow Yun Fat certainly make the movie more alive but I wish he have more part in it.PS: should there be a sequel, I will watch it",Negative
837,"First off, I was not one of the automatic pessimist's that tackled this board at the first sight of the film being produced. I had very high hopes for this movie, and well, it just didn't deliver. Being a huge fan of Dragonball ever since I was 10 years old, I was extremely excited to watch this. At the beginning of the movie, Goku cracks a lot of corny jokes, which really gave me the feel of the anime. Dragonball the anime was always full of terrible jokes so I thought maybe Wong did this on purpose. However, after venturing farther into this movie, I think it was an accident. James Chatwin may be the worst actor in the business after this movie. In some parts he reminded me of William Shatner when he was Captain Kirk on Star Trek. Also, the fight scenes maybe lasted around 2 minutes tops. I mean really Mr. Wong, what the hell were you thinking? It hurts me to say this movie sucked, but there's no better word to describe it. If this movie got a new director and script, then a sequel is very possible. Character development is key in Dragonball, and this movie had none whatsoever. So don't go into this movie with your hopes up. Instead, be optimistic that someone else will pick this script up and re-vamp it for a better, clever, and more violent sequel. It is possible, but right after seeing this horrible adaptation, my hopes are not high.",Negative
838,"I'll keep this brief.Those who aren't familiar with the Dragonball mythos will most likely be confused by this film. Despite the many changes that the creators of this movie made to the narrative, it relies heavily upon an assumed pre-existing knowledge of the franchise on the part of the viewer.Those who ARE familiar with the Dragonball franchise will get to experience the joy and warmth of a cherished childhood narrative being simultaneously raped and defecated upon. Case in point: the creators were obviously trying to cash in on the success of Transformers through Goku's remodeling as an angsty high school student who also happens to be sooper speshul (not a theme exclusive to Transformers, obviously, but the plagiarism is hard to ignore here). He's a horny, frustrated, manipulative young man who cares more about getting a kiss from a girl he barely knows than saving the world (this is illustrated quite literally during his attempt to master the kamehameha technique).I'm only a casual fan of the original series, but oh ye gods this is a terrible movie.",Negative

FOX YOU HAVE RUINED ALL MY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES. why..??? why did u guys made a movie like this..!!!! don't u have any respect for the fans, do you????? After watching this movie now i realize that there's nothing in common with the actual anime, only some of the characters names and the dragon balls.

841,"I tried to count the many, MANY canonical errors this movie made and I lost count at about ten minutes in. It got to be very concerning for me, as if not a single person in the cast or crew had ever seen a Dragonball episode in their lives. The script is so far gone from the original plot that I can not even imagine what must have gone through the writer's head as he composed this garbage. Surely he did not intend to further the gripping tale so timeless and successful that it sparked a decades-old franchise, so what might have been the reason behind this movie? It is a question that has offered up another question that I can not answer: how different can a licensed piece of work be from the original and still claim to be related?In the original series Goku was just a little kid with a monkey tail having all kinds of wacky adventures searching for the Dragon Balls. Bulma had hair the color of a robin's egg, Roshi was older than the hills, and Chi-Chi was the princess daughter of an enormous beast of a man appropriately named ""The Ox King"". Apparently my inferior Earth logic can not comprehend the neural paths required to transform this series into a teenage high school drama. Teenagers should not even be watching this program anymore! The first episodes to premier in America were in early 1996. Even if you were six years old when you got hooked on this show, where are you now? You are in college, still drinking illegally but well past living with your parents and trying to ""fit in"" with the ""normal crowd"". Even if you ARE in high school, you are five to ten years past watching anything decent on Cartoon Network, much less an episode of Dragonball.My point is that the apparent target audience of this movie is Dragonball fans first and teenage drama fans second. The plot being as far removed from the original story as my car is from the moon, Dragonball fans will hate this movie. They will hate it and everyone associated with it. I am genuinely surprised that in the 8.5 hours (as of this writing) the movie has been out, someone has not been murdered because of the rage it creates among its rabid fan base.If you have never seen Dragonball and have no expectations for this movie, go ahead and see it. You are the only people I could possibly recommend this movie to. However, you will be sorely disappointed by its lack of a driving plot, stunted length, numerous unanswered questions, and the fact that you will see no naked breasts on the screen. As a movie alone, it is still worthless. At no point did I find myself asking, ""I wonder what will happen next,"" but again I might be biased, the aforementioned rabid Dragonball fan that I am.See this movie for yourself if you do not believe me, but please, do not see it in the movie. Download it illegally, for I will not live with myself knowing I furthered the popularity of such a disgraceful piece of trash.",Negative
842,"""Dragonball Evolution"" has a great distinction. It's currently #20 on the infamous IMDB Bottom 100 List...the list of the worst rated major release films. This isn't totally surprising, as the list currently has quite a few films based on videogames*....such as ""Street Fighter"", ""BloodRayne"", ""Alone in the Dark"", ""Super Mario Brothers"" and ""Far Cry"". But it does boggle the mind to try to understand how a studio can throw this much money at a film project and STILL come up with garbage. For $30,000,000, they created a film that's lower rated than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""!!Goku** is a high schooler who as been trained by his grandpa to master his great fighting skills...though Goku has been sternly instructed to hide these skills and not fight. But after Grandpa is attacked by forces of Lord Piccolo (some weird green guy who looks like Gazoo), he tells Goku to find Roshi to tell him that Piccolo has returned. Then, grandpa assumes room temperature and Goku goes on his quest. Soon he picks up some compatriates and hopefully they can successfully stop Piccolo and whatever naughtiness he has planned....and part of that involves Piccolo finding all seven dragonballs.What follows is a film that is just about all fighting...one fight after another after another. The plot, what there was of it, I found confusing*** and the dialog was often rather dopey. And, speaking of dopey, this film repeated one of the worst cliches. In ""Star Wars: Episode 3"" you have young Vader fighting inches from lava without even breaking a sweat or spontaneously combusting....and the same occurs here.
Overall, a confusing and bad film with a rather anticlimactic ending. But I also think that it's not quite Bottom 100 bad. I think the reason it made the list is that lovers of the franchise were so angry and disappointed in the film they tended to score it especially low. Still, either way, it was a poor movie....at best.
*Yes, I know Dragonball was also an anime...a very popular one at that. And the fans of the show apparently were NOT pleased with this film...much like they were when ""The Last Airbender"" came to theaters.**Why does Goku look like a typical American teen and yet grandpa is Asian? What's with that?!***Maybe fans of the show/videogame won't be as confused as me. I just found the plot to be a mess.",Negative
843,"The film was a very good book/cartoon/ to Live/action adaptation. Starting off, the point of the name of the film ""evolution"" means basically a step up from it being a straight adaptation of the kids cartoon show towards making it more for a younger/teen audience hence ""Goku in high school"" The beginning of the film has such a Dragonball feel to it when you see Goku with the sweat dropping from his face and then giving the signature ""Goku"" look in the cartoon. The scene also is very ""cartoonish"" too with Grandpa Gohan's lines ""prepare to eat dirt!"" and the fighting is also very impressive even having a very ""dragonball"" feel it to as well. Justin Chatwin has such the face of Goku it's not even funny as does James Marsters with the face of Piccolo hence perfect casting choice for the both of them. I could say more about how they gave tribute to the cartoon and Manga too! (listed below). However there could have been much more fighting with Goku and Piccolo. The most impressive thing to me was the look and feel of the Dragonball world they created for the film that really matched or gave tribute to the cartoon and Manga..There definitely is more and I'll add more when I watch it again. The film even played like watching a full-length episode on the TV!!..The film also had a very beautiful and impressive score that had a feel of ""hope"" and ""faith"" when watching it. Even the film had a great Buddhist message in it too matching the Manga/cartoon.. ""In order to become One, I must be two"" In order to become ""One with your soul"" you must become One with the Divine ""Yin-Yang"" The Divine Mother and Father ""Creator"" of the Universe. By becoming ""ONE"" with them you transcend the opposites of the your soul and are now born again in them as now a ""Buddha child"" of the Divine. The creator of the Manga and cartoon Akira Toriyama created it with this Buddhist principle and message since he really has a great admiration and respect to the religion of Buddhism..Definitely a great message for children to have great faith to overcome all evils of the world and follow God and become ""pure"" and ""holy"" in Him and remain ""ONE"" in Him as His Child of Divine Love..Here are more of things the filmmakers did to tribute to Manga/cartoon1. Master Roshi's home being on an island in the city tributing the cartoon of it being on a island in the ocean2. Piccolo's ship hover-craft 3. The World Martial Arts Tournament4.

The acting was bad, yet there was action and most of the cast are american.

This isn't Dragon Ball at all.Do you know what this movie was?

NOT Spider Man. And this movie is NOT Dragon Ball.Did the people who put this movie out really just not want to make money? Because I'm pretty sure that's what happened.

854,"Dragonball Z is by far one of the popular animated shows ever to hit television, and has left major landmark on the anime genre. This manga-turned anime series was brought to life by Japanese artist Akira Toriyama who brought on air in Japan in the late 1980s before the show made its way to the U.S to become a cult sensation it still remains today. The genesis of the television show is a boy named Goku who travels across the world in search of seven magic orbs (known as Dragonballs) that will summon a dragon who will grant the finders one wish before scattering the orbs across the world for a next find. Along the way, he meets friends who assist on his journey and fight against the evil monsters that stand in his way. Growing up a DBZ fan as a kid, I was exciting about a DBZ, although I was a bit skeptical about live-action adaption to the television show. When a television gets a film adaption, fans want it be entertaining and pleasing to watch. Unfortunately, this adaption to the DBZ series is just a film gone terribly wrong.This film, directed by James Wong, stars Justin Chatwin as the iconic character Goku, a high school student living with his grandfather Gohan (played Randall Duk Kim). On his eighteenth birthday, his grandfather gives a magical orb called a dragonball which can used by the dragon Porunga to grant one wish, but only when the other six scattered across the world are found. When the world becomes threatened by an evil alien Lord Piccolo (played by James Marsters), Goku bands together with martial art master Roshi (played by Chow-Yun Fat), scientist named Bulma (played by Emma Rossum), her boyfriend Yamcha (played by Joon Park), and later Goku's high school crush Chi-Chi (played by Jamie Chung) to fight off against the evil Lord Piccolo and find the dragonballs to save the world from his wrath. What could have been a exciting action- packed thrill ride becomes a horrendous adaption that's plagued by horrible acting, terrible writing, cheesy dialogue, and an overall lack of spirit to the television franchise.It is astounding difficult to describe a massive disappointment this film is, especially for those fans of the TV show. The best way to start maybe the poorly written characters that fall short of spirit to their television counterparts. This story takes the liberties of making Goku into a high school student who develops a crush on Chi- chi which is blatantly false to the original source material. To matters worse, the film plagues the characters with laughable dialogue that sounds like from a cheesy teen rom-com. The performances of these characters are far too lazy to take seriously, and the writings of these characters make them difficult to care for; and for DBZ fans, unrecognizable. Later we introduced to Master Roshi who is given laughable performance by Chow-Yun Fat and awkward dialogue much like the rest of the characters. None of the characters are properly developed, nor the main villain Piccolo who remains one-note throughout the short runtime. As the film progresses, it transcending through a series of story elements that are completely unfaithful to both anime and manga series, and action sequences that should have been redeeming, but fall short of depth, not even closely resembling the fight scenes appeared on the show. Dragonball; Evolution is a total disgrace to the television series, and a major disappointment to fans of the series everywhere. Whether you are a fan of the show or not, this film is definitely NOT one I can recommend. It stands as a definite example of what a television- based movie shouldn't be, and one that fails to stay true to its original source material.",Negative

856,"As a young kid I grew up and always had a fond recollection of the DragonBall series. The first one ranks amongst the best of the trilogy; the second one was all about steroids and screaming matches for ten minutes until they had no room, and the third one tried to combine most... but by then it was over. But the first one, a retelling with some twists on the legendary Monkey King story eons ago, was amongst the most memorable.You had a charming little tale of a young boy, lost in the road of life and blissfully unaware of what the city, the world, had to offer him. Joining a spunky intelligent lass on a quest to collect the seven DragonBalls. Seven grant a wish, but this path would not be easy: midget demons were after it, an entire army of soldiers with dark intentions were after it, not to mention desert thieves and bandits. To the common stranger, you might as well have called this somewhat of thinly veiled Superman story, or simply taking a classic legend into something funny, witty, and wise.This piece of sh.t is an abomination. If the early photo designs of a dude in an Ambercrombie and Fitch t-shirt with a strangely chiseled jawline and rubbery Goku plastic hair did not phase you, then now you will ultimately learn your mistake in judgment, my friend.From the very moment I booted this up, nothing seemed to bother me. Why is Goku not Asian? I shrugged it off, and was kind there. They screwed this up in two other adaptations, but I figured, 'Well, it's not like I watch this show anymore, so...' Then I questioned the absence of Roshi's beard and sunglasses, his crave of porn. This too was absent. Where was Yamcha's mane? Why is Bulma ugly? All of these were simple marks I passed off, thinking, 'Well, it's not like Hollywood gets anything right anymore... they see something beautiful and take a dump on it.' Then I saw one pivotal plot point, and then I was done.I was done.I could not see this movie any more.For anyone who should have seen DragonBall in some form or another - and you should have, it's been on for a century now in constant movie re releases - then you should know Son Goku. Goku is a masculine Hulk Hogan character who, stupid as he is, knows how to rearrange people's faces physically while being a gentle soul.So forgive me when I ask, why is he being picked on by black people at thirty minutes into the movie and acting like an emotional, suicidal teenager? Can someone point me into the idiot who added that into the script? Why is he going to school with that haircut? With that kind of confused, poor attempt at a James Dean face, I'd beat the hell out of him too.At that point, I took my rental and snapped the disc in two. It does not deserve to live. Nor does it need a sequel, or games.This is when we allow 2nd graders borrow the 'Superman' script by Richard Donner for reviews and editing.",Negative
857,"What in the world is this blasphemy not against anime or entertainment but to life in general? This is a crime against the people.If you are a fan of the series, STAY AWAY from this disrespect to the original content. This was pretty much made by people knew NOTHING about the anime, let alone the manga. (Ok they knew the names, that's it) and to make things worse, even if we don't care about how embraces Dragon Ball, is still a boring and ridiculous nonsense. Sorry for using too many adjectives but this movie is so forgettable I barely remember anything about it.To summarize, DO NOT WATCH, and not exceptions, I can ensure you, you'll have a better life without watching this attempt of a movie. Lucky I can't give a 0/10, because it absolutely deserves such horrendous rating.",Negative
858,"This movie does DBZ series no justice. First off, you know how they cast a white guy in an obvious Asian role. Sure, he is an alien you say, but that's no excuse. He also has super powers to blow up an entire planet... what i'm trying to say is that Goku has black hair, eats Asian food, is married to an Asian woman, lives in an Asian country.. so on and so forth.. Let racist Hollywood put a white dude with his Asian wife.. I'm boycotting this movie and have advised all my friends not to watch it.. Let them lose their money on this flick. If you want to watch this crap.. do it for free using bit torrent or something.",Negative
859,"OK were to start, with this awful movie. First fan in and out. ,have the original anime series on DVD (well the ones that are out). Second At least it is considered a start, a good start...no, terrible start, but a start nonetheless.Characters, master roshi, good actor choice no one can argue, but he had to be more perverted towards bulma/more perverted anyway and has to be more clumsy in my opinion. The character as Goku, my lord, cliché after cliché. Knowing the results before they happen leaves no experience to go on with the movie (it isn't hard to guess after each incident what will/would happen next). And how come Goku wasn't getting trained to much or use of his stick (by Roshi), tell about 'rushed' results. Last for Goku is..""The HAIR"", young, old, new, anything, Goku is known for the hair, not somewhat a 70's cut like in this movie, but actually hair that is so out there like the anime's, people know him just by the hair (hair result in movie = failed). For piccolo, the fan that wrote on IMDb, Piccolo, 'looks like a vampire and his costume is matrix to a T', nailed it on the review. It's 2009 and piccolo looked like 1999 horror movie, and his clothes??? where is the cap and hat that weigh him down in training come on give me/us something!! Yamcha wasn't bad (by bad, his acting was OK), but kind of useless (his character). I guess the director never really saw or understood the Yamcha character from the anime (i wont spoil, watch the movie, understand the cartoon and you'll see). Yamacha supposed to be some what a good fighter, epically in DB not so much DBZ or DBGT, although in all of them Yamcha stands out most in DB as a strong/somewhat equal fighter to Goku. In this movie, he was just a bandit, with no talent except to rob.....bore! Now for the females, meaning Chi Chi and Bulma/hell even the other 'bad' chick. All are beautiful(bulma more than the others), Chi Chi(second) was like a goku character, cliché after cliché, knowing either what her line is/was going to be, or knowing what will/would/is going to happen to her, or around her. Bulma's role wasn't to bad (although needs more GREEN to her hair, maybe she can borrow some from the awful looking Piccolo), she was what she kind of is/was in the amine. Smart/and a good fighter. The cheesiness in her lines comes from what the director puts in the script so you can't fault her for those. The morphing chick mai, pretty but in the end useless. Yea she helps the evil character to conquer the earth but come on, her powers aren't and were never really useful to help someone like a Piccolo. You can tell when she morphs to someone else, and is going to be plotting evil or bad things (i wont mention parts in movie, but you will be strictly able to guess them while watching/if ever watching :)).In the end i say 3, why? Because it does use the name dragonball, and does have dragonball characters, and tries to be/tie the 'dragonball' concept but fails, and fails miserably. So it's like a bad action movie, except fans of the original anime/and others will want to watch this movie just to see what 'bad' action for a DB/DBZ/DBGT fan really means.2 last notes - Visual effects, it looks 50/50 on arguments for these....unless they were low on cash, the effects plain out suck, i can do better with the comp I'm using to write this. No offense, people that think there OK to Good, i dunno what movie you were watching but the effects were below par..and far below par, like the script of this movie. Second - Oh yea, the dragon (shenron), did anybody find the dragon was like the size of a big whale or something (not to be funny?? Remember this dragon (Shenron) is supposed to be the size of the earth/universe/ something huge to show how important he is, and in the movie, he is like the 'baby Shenron' so tiny and looks useless (useless by how he grants the wish's), and why dosen't he talk??Anyways 3/10, that's pushing the 3.",Negative
860,"Until 5/11/2014 its rating is 2.8. Looks like a really bad movie, or anyone can call it a trash movie. But, for me it's not really bad. Maybe the point of this movie is to get the money from a lot of Dragonball's fan all around the world, I bet everyone include my grandpa know what Dragonball is and my grandpa is really know about this manga, its the truth. If you watch it as a standalone movie and just forget about the ""adaptation"" word you will like this as some average American b-movie. I love Dragonball very much and have complete all its anime and manga and I know this is a bad-adaptation. I know too a lot of IMDb voter never watch this movie, they just give 1 star just because of its cast choice. The last thing is this movie still fail as a standalone because its story looks like rushing and really bad character development but everyone can still enjoy this as a fun movie. I think they need some mega-budget to make the Dragonball's world just like everyone dreamed for. 2.8 is too low.",Negative
861,"I just finished watching this movie and I have to say WHAT A DISASTER!!! I am very disappointed and this does not happen often, I am actually frustrated.The characters don't look anything like their cartoon counterparts and it seems to be blatantly obvious that very little, if any, effort was taken to rectify this. To lay more emphasis on my previous statement let me give you one example, Yamcha's most distinguishing or noticeable facial characteristic, the scar was missing.The writers have done a pathetic job, I seriously doubt if they have even seen the anime and I would like to summarize the director's role with just 2 words 'utterly disgraceful'. The storyline is a joke (not the funny kind either). The fight sequences were just lame and the worst part is that, it seems that nobody took the little effort required to make this movie even bearable.As a dragon ball z fan, I have to say that I actually consider this movie to be nothing short of a disgrace to the dragon ball series. I still can't believe that someone is even willing to put their name on this train wreck.If you are planning to watch this movie or due to sheer curiosity are thinking ""exactly how bad can it be?"". Take my word for it, expect the worst and it still won't reach your expectations.As I said before, this movie can be summarized as ""A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY"".",Negative

864,"The movie frustrates me. The fight scenes are boring and very short. I was expecting huge explosions (tight budget?-)). It would have been better to cut the scenes in school as I don't really remember much of Goku's life studying or probably I just missed them shown on TV. Goku's transformation into an ape was poorly done. I like Emmy Rossum as Bulma; she did well. Chatwin was alright. I think the movie should have to be re-shoot better fight scenes, extreme power for destructions (that is what Dragonball was known for). The movie failed to make me a part of it as I wasn't really seeing myself immersed and wanting to see more. My eyes riveted on the screen hoping to see more but the movie was just it has it can offer; it made me unhappy. I wont recommend this movie; this should have just been put on the shelves for TV/cable viewing.",Negative
865,"OMG, not since Mega-Force (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084316/) has such an abomination hit the big screen.It's obvious that no though went into any continuity between the animated characters compared to their respective (ha!) actors. Perhaps it was just me, but each characters direction seemed to be that of watching a colony of ants at work. In other words, you see that they were all doing something, but to the untrained eye you're not able to define their exact role. This was nothing more than 85 minutes of random events taking place. All I kept thinking was a quote from Peter Griffin ""my God! why don't somebody throw a pie!"". When the lights finally came on in the theater, the disappointed reaction from everyone (Dragon Ball fan or first time novice) was the same... PLEASE LORD, DON'T MAKE A SEQUEL.And why was Ernie Hudson in this spectacle? I'm just glad that he wasn't cased as Mr. Po-Po, or I would've really been offended!",Negative

868,"It is not possible in 1,000 words to explain just how bad this film is, it seems they've completely not bothered to actually do any research into Dragonball (or its sequels Z and GT). This film completely ignores the source material, and is Dragonball in name only (apart from character names as well).Whoever wrote the story for this film deserves less respect than Uwe Boll, and thats saying something.If you're a fan of Dragonball, Z or GT, I recommend not to see this horrendous steaming pile of crap. Next time Hollywood, instead of a cheap unrelated cash in, try making something decent and stay true to its roots.",Negative
869,"Dragonball, my precious childhood cartoon, how much I hate to see you fall to the hands of such a pitiful director.What on earth was twentieth century fox thinking? James Wong is by far one of the most under-classed directors in the field, and they decided to put him on the Dragonball project? Has anyone looked at his movie history? He did the Final Destination movies, the first one was good but the rest were laughable. Also The One with Jet Li. To think that it would be really hard to make a movie stink with Jet Li in it. Guess what?...James Wong managed to do it.Also, what on earth was he thinking with the cast list? Justin Chatwin? What has he done that is noticeable? Oh and Joon Park. He has done two movies in the U.S. He was a driver in Speed Racer and now he is doing Yamcha and Dragonball. He did the audition in shorts and a t-shirt and he was given the part...excuse me? How can a director make such a poor decision when coming to auditions? Emmy Rossum was a good acting choice, but what is the point of good acting if you also have poor duologue? The writer also, look at his history. He has done almost absolutely nothing. Basically what twentieth century fox did was take the worst of everything and everyone to try to make a movie for fan-boys/girls. Look out it turned out.Now that I am done with the ranting, let me quickly summarize how this project should have been gone about.For a director, they should have told James to take a hike and hire someone who actually has a good amount of experience. If it were up to me then I would put Zack Snyder on the project. The man is a brilliant director with a visual mind unlike any other. Look what he did with 300 and Watchmen. I could definitely see him doing the same for Dragonball. As far as the cast, it is simple, find people with experience. The cast of Watchmen was not very noticeable before the movie but they did great with this movie because the director actually cared about the movie when it came to auditions. For a scriptwriter, It is not a hard concept, find a smart well known scriptwriter and have him adopt from the Manga. James Wong just seemed too lazy to do any of this. Anyone who is not James Wong would have known all of this which proves how under-classed he is.Do us a favor Hollywood. Redo this movie someday and tell James Wong to take a hike and do it right. Thank you for ruining this experience for me James, really.",Negative

I mean common man none of the characters looked like the anime characters, I wish they could hit all the people who watched this crap with that lost memory gun they used on MIB and sacked the whole film crew that made this garbage and started from scratch, and maybe get a director that has actually watched the series not some guy with a Asian name just to sit more bums at the theater's, I'm so glad I didn't waste money watching this crap at a cinema!!!! But I still feel ripped off! I'm so angry at the moment because DB is one of the all time great anime's! And to be f#$#d like that really pisses me off! And too all those people saying that this is a GREAT movie..we all know who u work forfox must be paying u well because it must be hard sleeping at night with the smell of BS coming out of your mouths! REBOOT THIS MOVIE PLSSSSS",Negative
871,"OK I'm reviewing this while watching it so Yeah apologise for the ruff edges , my main issues with this movie is not the casting however it is an issue , its the apparent disregard for the story there are massive plot gaps previously cover'd in the show like Gokus grandpa being killed by piccolo instead of being killed by Goku when he transformed , Goku not having a tail etc.. stuff like that , if you've ever watched the Dragon ball , or Dragon ball z then this movie will aggravate you the the point of migraine Now lets move to the casting issues lets start with the Pros: master Roshi , Yamcha and even Goku to and extent are played surprisingly well and keep to the shows characters Roshi is a dirty old pervert , Yamcha is a money chasing scoundrel , and Goku is the good guy pure and simple CONS : and these are the real bones to pick Chi chi , Bulma & Piccolo are played ridiculously badly they have no Clue what there doing it feels to me that James Wong (director) watched like 3 episodes and said yeah lets butcher this , Bulma is flat there's no real spark from her no chemistry with Goku or Yamcha , Chi chi is some teenage cheer leader type doesn't really come across as the warrior princess from the show & Piccolo Ah where to begin Using James Masters just didn't work he just doesn't have the presence required to play such a Strong character his performance just came of as weak and not very engrossing. Now that weave got that out of the way i can tackle the Movies flaws as a whole most of the movie as drawn out with very little action , some shallow references to stables of the show like the Kame Hame ha etc... but to me it's missing way to much to even call itself a dragon ball movie so Manny characters don't make an appearance such as , krillin Goku's best friend , Tien , ChuSu , Mr Po Po , Corin the list goes on and for a move called dragon ball it cant quite decide when its taken place its seams to jump and take elements from later and try and mix them , for example goku is 18 in this movie and in the show by that time he has met Bulma ,Yamcha,Master Roshi and beaten the RR army and defeated king piccolo were in this hes had an uneventful childhood as soon as he reaches 18 all manner of crap happens also in the end battle when you expect to see a excellent fight sequence your instead treated to Goku's supposed transformation in to Ozaru in the show a Giant destructive ape in the movie a guy that badly needs shaved .in conclusion and i apologise for ranting , but i grew up with these shows and it really aggravates me when directors bastardise them like thieve done here , I've waited for years to see this show brought to the big screen and to see some of the epic sagas play out with real actors and see what a Hollywood budget could do to improve a beloved franchise ...., if this movie is anything to go by Not a frigging LOT if your a fan of the SHOW then for your own sake AVOID this Luke warm Puddle of excrement calling its self a movie .",Negative
872,"Anybody who is a fan of Dragonball will be extremely disappointed with this movie. Even if you aren't a fan, this movie is still just awful. The story has absolutely no structure, and does not even have the slightest resemblance to the series it is supposedly based off of.I watched this movie, and being a fan of Dragonball. It was painful, that's the only way I can describe it. The story is extremely cliché, and the plot and theme is less than mediocre.Being an avid fan of the series. It is hard for me to say this but, this movie is a 1/10. They did not follow the story of Dragonball, they simply took the Title and the Names of the characters.I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Or it is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I am shocked to hear they want to make it a trilogy.What a shame, and what a disappointment.",Negative

This movie is about 5% done, im not saying don't give it a watch, but you might find that if you download it to the computer skipping parts of the movie will become a common thing for you to do throughout, i found myself skipping to the fight scenes. I tried to watch the scenes with no fighting but they were just so boring, I think the acting was awful as well. I hope this movie gets put into the hands of real film makers, and that the next one is fully complete and can actually be as well done as the anime was all these years.",Negative
874,"as many other reviewers, I grew up watching DB. Between some good action series (dark angel) and action movies (Fantasic Four) I thought Fox was going to do a good tribute. But no. This movie was terrible. Plot was changed deliberately it had almost nothing to do with the original saga. Fight scenes were good but minor and other than one or two cheap ""After Effects"" power blasts (won't reduce myself to call those abominations kamehameha or mafuba) the movie failed to impress me. Not only they disprespected us old-school fans, but also a great and very known Japanese singer Ayumi Hamasaki, who composed a song SPECIALLY for Toriyama and the movie. And guess what? Fox didn't use it!! Well they did, but only in stupid credits that song was fantastic for an action scene. What a joke!! If you want to see a good ""live action version"" of Dragon Ball, go with ""Forbidden Kingdom"" (Jackie Chan and Jet Li). Not really based on Dragon ball but on Monkey King (DB too so they have some similarity) This movie just doesn't worth it. Except three hot chicks and a fantastic (altough terribly misused)song by Ayu, there is nothing I can save nor recommend about this movie. Are you a DB fan? You can avoid this. I give it two stars instead of 1 because granted, its still way better than the one china did in 1991. But don't get fooled: both movies suck anyways.",Negative
875,"As a HUGE Dragonball fan, I was psyched to the announcement of a live action movie a few months back; but as more information was revealed I started to lose faith. A few days prior to seeing the movie, I had lost all hope of it being remotely good. A 3/10 on IMDb spells disaster. After seeing the movie I can say that I am pleasantly surprised. Although the story was Americanized and modernized to hell and back, it did have its moments of faithfulness to the original manga/anime, specifically with the characters. Goku was very different from the anime, but it was good in its own way. Chatwin did a good job with what he had to work with. I was especially happy with Chow Yun-Fat as Roshi. I was skeptical of his placement in the movie until I saw it myself. He did a fantastic job of bringing the Master Roshi we know to life on the big screen. Lets not forget Yamcha either; he too was able to very faithfully recreate the original character. I was not big on Rossum Bulma but she did do a decent job. Marsters was a good Piccolo but he didn't get as much screen time as I had hope for. As far as anime faithfulness goes, there were several other things throw in that surprised me as far as getting them right but I won't go into detail, I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. Overall, Dragonball Evolution is a decent modern martial arts film with some neat special effects, cool action scenes, but not a faithful adaptation to the series we all know and love. My final verdict is a 6/10 but I could be swayed to a 7/10. Don't let its inaccuracies prevent you from experiencing a new twist on the same old (amazing) story, its still worth your time if you enjoy a good old action movie.",Negative

If I could stop the movie, take a good picture of them, I thing it would worth as a background of a background (that no one can see).2.

Well, at the beginning is quite okay but as the story goes, make me want to sleep. And even what they did to Bulma? Bulma didn't carry any gun (If I not mistaken). Well to be honest, I just may advised for those who still have respect Dragonball, I recommended you not to watch this movie as you will get angry after watching this movies. Sorry for all the cast, but I only be able to give 1/10. However for those of didn't like Dragonball, you might find this movie is interesting.",Negative

It's a total joke and as I've been saying from day one...what were they thinking casting Caucasians in these roles. The graphics are very laughable. Bulma has one strand of blue hair and brown eyes. The screenplay is very poorly written. There was noting compelling Fox to make this movie. Then why put so much money into something made so half-heartedly?? And I could go on.",Negative

A truly amazing experience, I highly highly highly recommend. If you dislike this review I'll shut up.",Negative
881,"Before seeing this movie, take into consideration what was done with the new Star Trek movie. That being said, I looked at Dragonball Evolution as an almost alternate universe from the original anime. Yes, there are in fact some MAJOR differences from this movie and the anime; simply looking at anything at all in regards to this movie, the viewers can see that Goku is an adult in the movie, whereas in the anime he starts out as a child.When people go to the movies to see something that was originally a comic book, or a book, they need to EXPECT for there to be some changes. Look at Spiderman, in the TV show, the spider that bit him went through a radioactive beam and then found it's way to Parker. In the Spiderman movie (2002), the scientists changed the DNA of the spiders to genetically enhance them.The same has to be done for Dragonball: Evolution. The director probably knew that things would be different in the movie than how they were in the anime and in the manga. Yes, Goku's hair (as can be seen in the posters and whatnot) isn't exactly the same as it was, but how goofy would Justin have looked with that hair due? They wanted the whole thing to feel more NOW.I feel that they did that quite well. They wanted to introduce a new Goku, and they did it.When watching the movie, come out of the box a little and look at what they did. Not just how different it is; take into consideration the time, the audiences that would go and see it (Not all of the viewers would be super hardcore DB/DBZ/GT fans!), and the fact that they wanted to test to see how well it could be done.It's VERY hard to turn something that's been drawn for so long into real flesh and blood.",Negative
882,"If you think that i am gonna start ranting about how god awful this movie is and why you should not watch it in a theatre then you are wrong because that comes after i tell you why that it sucks so much.This movie is based on the adventures of Son Goku in the world of DragonBall. Toriyama Sama created this epic. he said that this was a manga (Graphic Novel or comic book) that he had been waiting to write for some time. He had already enjoyed success with the popular series Doctor Slump and Aralie Chan. It took 3000 plates(boxes in pages) and 6 years to complete. the series had 148 fights and more than 1 hundred characters.DragonBall was loyal to the fans, in its Anime Master Toriyama himself drew the characters. Even in the Video games the talented Toriyama Sama himself designed the 3D characters which stand true to the source. DragonBall has set a standard of quality that its fans have come to expect from it and when DragonBall Evolution was announced most had a mixed reaction as the previous 2 adaptations had not been very good perhaps due to the budget. FOX put a lot of money into this project that could put Dragonball on the big screen for the world to see but which it did the only problem is that apart from the name Dragonball and its characters at FOX's disposal there is no resemblance to the original series.I had a bad feeling in my gut 9 months ago when we found out that Toriyama Sama has been left out of the project for some ""plot changes"" that was when things started getting ugly and as we found out more about it and now its finally here. Despite of amazing DragonBall concept of Toriyama we get a washed up cliché based typical American teen highschool crap that has been done like a million times and done better. This movie does not satisfy the DragonBall fans or typical movie fans because all FOX wanted was to cash up on the sifi superhero thing that is popular these days. To them DragonBall and all other such manga are just labels that attract an audience they feed off the financial value of it and then just move on. DragonBall has a strong fanbase consisting of people from all ages and parts of the world. FOX has let us all down by giving us this mockery of a classic, alas they could have earned millions if they had done it right but they still can if it is remade with improvements such as a BETTER DIRECTOR and Triyama back on the team so that FOX can really make money off of it which is fine if would just stop this trilogy from happening to us. I score it 1 out of 10",Negative
883,"Thinking of a recent example (other than this one) - SpeedRacer.Are there no Asian actors that can speak English?

And that's not to mention the terrible CGI/editing throughout the movie.Multi-colored fire = energy? How sad.This movie's producers really need to benchmark successful attempts like (discounting the obvious Batman) X-Men, HellBoy, Matrix, OldBoy for transitioning from anime presentation to live action presentation.And please, change the director (and most of the crew) if there will actually be a sequel/prequel/rework of this.",Negative
884,"""Dragonball: Evolution. The movie made by Fox as a live action adaptation of the popular anime series Dragonball.Now, I knew what I was getting into when I stepped into the theater earlier today, but that didn't stop me from being enraged at the blasphemy that unfolded in front of me. I know this review will be a little biased, as I am a Dragonball fan, but let me start off by saying that this movie is TERRIBLE. Fox really screwed up on this one. It doesn't even seem like they tried at all. Now, lets review the movie piece by piece.Plot: Fox had an entire wealth of story an characters and everything to go off of t o make this movie. What did they do? They tried to make their own story. they failed. Horribly. Let's address the length. 1 hour and 10 minutes roughly. Movies now adays are usually an hour and a half to 2 hours long, but AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES. That's not near long enough to get any of the story to Dragonball out.The movie went way too fast. There was virtually no time for character development. Scenes moved way too fast, the story went too fast, and overall the movie was too fast (which could be a good or a bad thing).The story itself. It just doesn't seem like Dragonball. the plot just seemed like generic action movie. You could've replaced all the characters and it would've made just as much sense. There were so many flaws and inconsistencies with the actual Dragonball story (way too many to write about right now). Any Dragonball fan will just be asking Why? the entire time. Also, Goku going to high school. WTF?! Let's just move onCharacters: Let me just get this off my chest, JUSTIN CHATWIN IS NOT GOKU, AND HE NEVER WILL BE. Now, Goku's character, if you've never seen the series, is basically happy, dumb, and doesn't know the ways of the world. In the movie, however, he is typical anxiety, smart-ass teenager. The character is nothing like Goku in any way shape or form, physically, or in behavior.Next character: Bulma. Again physically looks nothing like Bluma. They put one streak of blue in her hair I guess to make people tell that she's Bulma. Since when can we not give characters colored hair? Seriously, what the hell? She seems like much more of a bitch than she does in the series. Not much character development there.Master Roshi: Master Roshi is supposed to be a perverted old man who teaches Goku the Kamehameha. He teaches Goku the Kamehameha, but he is in no way the Master Roshi I knew.Chi Chi: Goku's love interest. Since when is Chi Chi the popular chick? Other than that she just seems like a generic love interest.Yamcha: First of all, he's blond. WTF? Second of all, they actually got this character pretty good, voice and all. It just doesn't match the look of the character. Also, WHERE'S THE WOLF FANG FIST?!King Piccolo: All I can say is, Space Voldemort.Mai: Just a random villain character because I guess they couldn't pick out any of the other various villains of Dragonball.Overall, the characters just have no uniqueness to them, none of that special Dragonball flavor that they're supposed to have. None of the characters seem like themselves, with the exception of Yamcha, and there's virtually no character development.Special effects: The special effects are very low grade in this film. The ki blasts look okay. The Kamehameha does not look like a Kamehameha. Piccolo looks like Voldemort. Shenlong looks like a generic dragon, and doesn't speak. Oozaru looked horrible (too small, and Goku didn't have a tail in which to transform).I'm sure I left out a lot, but I just don't feel like typing about this anymore. If you're a Dragonball, fan do yourself a favor and don't see this movie. Watch it online if you just HAVE to see it. This movie is NOT Dragonball, only in names (which they surprisingly got right). Overall, terrible movie, and will never see it again. Also, they are actually making a SEQUEL!! WHY?!?!?! No......just no. Fox, you've already ruined it. Stop beating the already dead, burned, chopped up, and run over, horse.""",Negative
885,"When i knew , goku was going to be an American , a year ago , i had a very ominous feeling about the film , and when i saw the theatrical trailer , i knew then that FOX has completely destroyed this Asian epic! This is what you get when someone tries to Americanize a true masterpiece!As an ardent fan of db/dbz/dbgt i was shocked to see , as to how bad a movie can really get!!! Bad acting by almost all actors , very poor visual effects , i've seen movies in the 80's have better visual effects . Bad directing , bad screenplay , bad story , they've tampered the story so bad that i was so devastated after watching the film , had sleepless nights for days . Watch the movie and u'll see what i mean ! This is what happens when you take a film without seeing one ***king episode , rather the director has developed the movie after reading a summary! The movie was so bad that u'd cry even in the scenes that the director meant to be funny and vice versa! My advice is that don't watch this film , do something more worthwhile like cursing the director!!!!!",Negative
886,"Hilariously bad. laughed so much. 7/10 on the hilariocity scale, 8/10 if you are a fan of the show. i don't even know why they'd base it on the show if they were just going to change EVERYTHING (2 viewings)",Negative
887,"""Dragonball"" in name only, ""Dragonball: Evolution"" feels less like the popular anime and manga series it was based on than a perfunctory ""Karate Kid"" knockoff that feels as lethargic as its local opening date (a Black Saturday). James Wong's (""Final Destination"") corny, albeit polished, quest movie tailored for the male preteen crowd drops much of its source's mythology in favor of juvenile kitsch that zips through its plot with the full awareness of its target audience's short attention span.For his 18th birthday Goku (Justin Chatwin) has been given by his grandfather and master Gohan (Randall Duk Kim) a dragonball, one of the seven orbs scattered all over the world that grants anyone who collects it all ""one perfect wish."" It turns out that Piccolo (James Marsters), an erstwhile imprisoned alien, has mysteriously escaped and is also after the balls to seek revenge on the Earth, where he was banished from 2,000 years ago when he planned to destroy it along with Oozaru (Ian Whyte). It's up to Goku to keep Piccolo and his femme aide Mai (Eriko) from finding the rest of the dragonballs and destroying the world (oooh!).The involvement of Stephen Chow as a producer all but indicates a cartoonish movie and its awareness of its source's daffy quality at least rightly fits in with its cast members gameness to not take everything seriously - as typified by Chow Yun-Fat's embarrassing turn as Master Roshi, Grandpa Gohan's former teacher and now sensei to Goku. Yet ""Dragonball: Evolution""'s greatest fault is perhaps its inability to gratify anyone, with fans of the series likely to cry foul with the liberal modifications done with the story and the characters; and everyone else realizing that it's an unexceptional fodder for a slow weekend.",Negative
888,"This movie is good in my opinion, not great. Why do you a great movie all the time? I pick out movies based on my personal preference and not on popularity. Only a few million saw this movie in theaters and no you have not seen it unless you see in theaters and not the bootleg incomplete one on the internet. I have seen this movie five times and it gets better. Those you do not like the changes and feel betrayed should grow up. It's just a movie and a good way to waste an hour and a half. It doesn't have anything I wouldn't want to see. Especially the ""Strawberry"" scene. Just because Goku is a white guy with no tail and wants to talk to girls is not a good enough reason to kill this thing. It's an adaptation and Hollywood always puts there spin on things. This is a revitalization of the series which ended over a decade ago and needed a fresh start. Watch this more than twice and you will like it too.",Negative
889,"1st of all I give 6 and +1 for all those dummies who call themselves fans and who voted that low. There are so many overrated movies out there and all those so called fans also overrate tons idiotic stuff. Well at least most of them. And I bet the lack of their taste is despicable! C'mon! Maybe that movie did not come out as the best for fans, but it was more than okay and watchable for the rest of us who barely seen 1 or 2 series of the dragonball anime series. The reason that movies like that don't come in 2nd parts coz of those stupid dummies that call themselves ""fans""! Hey, you - ""fans"" - RATE your socks and compare your wife to them next time you dicede to judge something that you never ever done before!",Negative
890,"This movie sucks ! I bet that there is absolutely no slightly good comment about this movie has been made so far. It's wrong from the very basic - the story - all out of line. Nothing alike to the anime. The only common is the names. that's it. Nothing more... or.. or they are both sth you can watch on your little screen. I have never heard of a Goku going to high school, asking for the way flirting girls, and as far as I know, master Roshi is not that young :)). How disappointed it was for me (I guess it was as well for DBZ fan) when I see how they made our hero up like that... the more powerful Goku look, the more this Goku disappointed us. They have such an awful crew. I think they had never had a chance looking or watching at least an episode of this Dragonball series. EVER! ... They don't know how our characters should look like, don't know how the charateristics of each characters. The Kung-fu is.... way off .... nothing even close to ""real"" Goku... Visual Effect is like a play with painting background...This is .... :(",Negative
891,"I was really enjoying the comments and was laughing my heart out at some point in time. I thought of leaving this website fully satisfied. But during the end I saw some comments and they made me to write this. When I first heard about the movie, I decided not to watch it because I thought DB is way beyond any live-action adaptation (all the fans know why). When I saw the trailer I was however surprised by the movie makers' creativity when I saw a Master Roshi with silky hair fit for any convincing shampoo ad. I knew instantly that the movie team is gonna surpass 'Citizen Kane', 'Shawshank Redemption', etc. easily. I knew that the movie would be too intellectual and too realistic for a stupid idiotic DB fan fool like me. Some coveted jury members of Academy Awards even said that they wanted a realistic movie so that they could relate themselves with Goku (just like Batman i guess). I am a hardcore DB fan and I too, like any other DB fan, would like to meet these 'beings' from Planet Vegeta (although I like DB but I am sane enough to accept the fact that Goku is an alien unlike the ones who want to relate themselves with Goku). Apart from these, 'Citizen Kane', hah, way too inferior than this masterpiece of this century. Right now I am waiting for at least 10 sequels so that I can send them to Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. They can make millions of copies, give them different names and drop them from air in countries like US and UK. People would watch them without suspicion and would definitely kill each other or commit suicide after watching such noble creations for they would think how worms like them dared to adore modern day ""MONALISA"" called sequels of DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION. Finally, terrorist organizations can enjoy a result far more devastating than 9/11.",Negative
892,"Dragonball: Evolution is like the toy that comes with the happy meal, and a pretty cheap one at that. It does what it needs to, but is far from what you could get for the little tyke at Toys R Us, and as long as it doesn't break down (which should be about a day or so) then it should be alright. The film is based on a long graphic novel series and a very long television show (not seen by me, though the parody ""Dragonball Z Abridged"" is one of the funnies things you may have not seen yet), and it can appeal to kids and um maybe young teens based on whether they've read the books or seen the show or not. If so, it will probably disappoint by not being totally faithful- not to mention half of the cast is white and not Asian (the villain Piccolo, if one can recognize him under lots of green make-up, is played by Buffy's James Marsters)- but if you haven't seen the show or books it will... probably disappoint as well.It's cliché in story and in action, it features those scenes we see in these movies and stories like when an old man or someone is about to die and the hero holds him in his arms and he declares something important before dying (or, of course, being noble enough to die with dignity). And of course the course of action as to who people are and what they'll do, like Roshi as the eccentric tutor to the young Luke Skywalker-type Goku (Chow Yun Fat and Justin Chatwin), and what the big final battle will entail. Luckily there are a few minor surprises, or just crazy bits of business like what Piccolo can make Goku do in the transformation-sense. And there are some hot girls to have the young boys in the audience go ""ooh"" to be sure, including a girl formerly on the Real World, if that means anything much.But yet, the movie isn't really hateable, despite what many would believe. It's not made with particular flair, but it doesn't disappoint the ways one might expect (currently another film with similar 'elements', such as mastering elements of water-fire-air-earth called The Last Airbender disappoints much more greatly on higher stakes). At worst its action is uninspired and some of the fights could use a little more 'humpf' to them - and there is a ""LOL"" moment to have when the two Asian girls are having a fight - and they look exactly the same! One perk I should mention is Chow Yun Fat, who knows better than anyone else in the film (perhaps since he's been in sillier works over the years) and knows how to chew scenery and have fun doing it. Any moment he's on screen the film comes alive in ways the other actors, at best delivering in competence, can't quite bring along.",Negative
893,"I knew all along that this movie was vaguely based on the actual story of Dragonball. The reason why I went to go see it was to laugh at it. The feeling I had going in was, ""Oh man! They made a movie out of an anime with flying people who shoots beams and fight really really fast!? I must see it just to laugh at its cheesiness"" yet... It was hard to even laugh at it cause it was just generally bad. There are a few quotes and some visual effects that I found really funny, but they lasted only a few seconds and that is all. It was just so bad that it was hard to make fun of it, or laugh at any of its parts. If anyone wants to watch it, rent it, it is not worth the price of watching it in theaters..... What am I talking about, just don't watch it. Seriously, if someone watches this in the theaters, it's equivalent to giving a homeless person some money and watching him/her go buy alcohol.",Negative
894,"I saw this movie on a bootleg. Best decision, I ever made. I can sum up the movie in 3 words; tacky, corny, and confusing, all in the extreme. The story was sloppy, the characterization absolutely ridiculous. The only thing I liked about the movie was when it ended. I hear 11 year old kids love this movie, and that just appalls me. I do NOT want the next generation watching this movie and thinking that this is what dragon ball is about! What we need now, is a Reboot, like with the Hulk, with a different director, and better writers. I think the cast could have done a good job, it was just the story, script and directing(Not to mention special effects!)That really screwed the movie over. If you want to be original, learn from movies like transformers and especially Casino Royale. Casino Royale, because it is an original story that that is executed in a way that stays faithful to the novel, keeping the characters largely the same, and keeping the basic and important concepts of the novel.",Negative

Anyone can direct a movie and make it suck. He needs to be shot. I'm serious, guy took a good anime and make it hell. Even Power Rangers is better then this movie! Why not have the director of X-men or Spiderman make this movie? They really screwed it up badly on this one. The director needs to get fired!!! badly!!! omg!!! this movie is a complete joke.",Negative
900,"When you go to see this movie, don't expect much. Nobody else did. It was evident from the trailers that the special effects were lacking. What they don't show you is that, in places, the special effects are stellar... but those scenes just aren't important. Goku jumps into Piccolo and his jump looks like an 8 year old copy and pasting in Microsoft Paint. BUT, Piccolo drops an energy ball into the water and we bullet-time in on the water drops. The effect is visually interesting but not at all important to the story.The problem with Dragonball is that it IS very hard to translate into live action. Nobody will ever be happy with how the characters look or the changes that had to be made to make the story go faster. That being said, a lot of things changed to make the movie faster. (I would have suggested either starting the movie with Grandpa Gohan dead or combining the characters of Roshi and Gohan. The second is a significant change but neither Roshi nor Gohan were important enough in this movie to warrant spending so much time with them.) Another thing evident from the trailer, Goku is older. Another thing, he has no tail. Minor changes considering nobody would want to watch a movie about a 12 year old.Bulma, Chi-chi, Yamcha, and Roshi's introductions are all awkward. But, these were big characters who needed to be introduced fast. The gist of their characters is intact. Yamcha wants the balls to be rich. Chi-chi is secretly a fighter. Bulma now wants the balls to be famous (as opposed to the perfect boyfriend). Roshi is mildly perverted, toned down from the cartoon show, but, of all characters, Roshi keeps the most accurate representation of the anime to the movie. In particular, making Goku run behind the car, carrying an obscene amount of weight. Personally, I didn't want to watch 2 hours of Goku training with Roshi just to have to pay another 7$ to watch Goku and Piccolo fight next summer.The dialog is awkward. Incredibly awkward. A few times, I actually felt uncomfortable listening to it. I asked ""did someone really just say that?"" and then I cringed more thinking ""did somebody really WRITE that?!"" Piccolo's origins are completely revamped, disappointingly. This is largely because the history of the Dragonballs was also revamped. I wondered why they didn't cut a few scenes (maybe with Chi-chi) to add in Kami and properly explain things. That way, when/if there is a sequel, Piccolo could be deployed a lot easier.There was 1 change in particular that I thought was great. Instead of transforming in a full moon, Goku now transforms when he sees a complete solar eclipse. These are far more rare. Problem is, he doesn't have a tail and it still happens...It was evident to me, throughout the movie, that this was a jumping point for another movie. I imagined them skipping clean over the rest of the Dragonball series in order to introduce Raditz, Nappa, and Vegeta in the next movie. The basic points were established to get there. Goku crashed (on a meteor?) from a foreign planet with no knowledge of who he was. He's becoming stronger in Ki and has the Oozaru in him. Now that the main characters have been introduced (with a few glaring exceptions), the next movie could jump to adulthood with no consequence. We have no reason to watch more of Goku's childhood now. Especially since he's turning 18 at the movie's opening.",Negative

903,"i put this one dreading what i was going to be seeing after looking at the front cover but I was actually very surprised to come away liking this movie.The key to remember when you watch it is to remember the context of the movie. Remember that DB comic was aimed at children and not to teenagers, like Dragon Ball Z was, and you will not take it as seriously and there fore enjoy it more.This movie captures well, the feel and vibe of the DB world. The character are translated well from comic to film and were true to their comic book counterparts. The scenery was very well observed and yet made to look like they could exist. The direction took a lot from the comics and cartoons which greatly added to the experience.Sure they made mistakes but over all I thought it was OK. lots of nods to the comic that were left unspoken to those who know their stuff. Over all I think it was a very good effort, remembering the budget, and I hope they make another one which builds one what the film makers have achieved. making it darker and more DBZ perhaps to appease the fan boys.I've read some strange things that people have written on this film such as issues of race or that it didn't follow the comic story lines accurately enough. I don't think audience the film makers are aiming for will care on such issues and therefore neither should you (the audience). Again put the film into context; and remember it is after all just a light-hearted film.",Negative
904,"I don't need to see it to know I'll hate it.1. Piccolo wasn't a king and didn't wear a crazy black space uniform 2. Goku knew of Roshi long before he was a teenager 3.

I'm also fairly sure there won't be a flying nimbus or a power pole I may be wrong on some of these points I haven't actually seen the movie and i won't until it comes to DVD, but still the TV trailer and theater trailer looked to be horrible.way to ruin my favorite childhood show (sell-outs)EPIC FAIL!!!",Negative
905,"I'm not a Dragon Ball hardcore fan, but the main reason that I'm writing this is because there's a lot of positive comments saying ""Absolutely Good Movie"", ""Creative and Clever Story"", ""Honestly not bad film"" or even ""Why isn't part 2 coming out?"" (left by a guy who blames those who tell the truth of that movie), etc.; and I'm worried about IMDb being sued for false advertising if it is left there. This movie is only fun for yourselves if you've been smoking some particularly strange and illegal substances.Dear God, this movie stole from Star Wars, The Matrix and The Last Airbender! In short, DBE makes the Taiwanese version of ""Dragon Ball"" (1992) look like a Greek tragedy in comparison. Yet it still ignores the source material. The CGI is crap, the special effects looks taken out from the Power Rangers, the dialogue makes Batman and Robin look thoughtful, and the characters... Goku is about as emotionless as a bag of rocks, and Yamcha looks like ""a tiger with Down syndrome."" This movie works as an insult directed towards Akira Toriyama and his fans...and directed by James Wong.For this example, I will be using a well known story, ""The story of Jesus Christ"", but I will do to Jesus' story what the writers did to Dragon Ball:Jesus Christ was born in California and went to Henry Austin High School. He used to get bullied growing up. His mom, Mary was a full time nurse who never had any time off. Jesus had some powers, but kept them hidden from everyone. One day Jesus went to a party. Everyone was complaining about there being no alcohol. Then Jesus used his power to turn every beverage in the fridge into beer. Then everyone thought he was super cool and got drunk. Suddenly Jesus was now the cool kid in school.You get the idea. But this is how bad they butcher the DBZ story. Just, kill this movie please. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. Avoid this movie at all cost.P.S.: For all the positive reviewers, ladies and gentlemen, Billy from SAW is waiting for you in the next door theater, and he is pleased to present a sissy and rather bad anime named ""Super Doll Licca-Chan"" (WARNING: This anime show *for little girls* will make a permanent brain damage). As you watch this anime, and in the locked theater, you will try to survive to find the key, while Billy will release poisonous gas and after will set ablaze the theater.

907,"(An Important Note: I am not a hardcore ""Dragonball"" or ""DBZ"" fan. I'm only vaguely familiar with the storyline of the franchise, and could probably count the number of episodes of the animes I've seen on my fingers. I am merely writing this review as an open critique of the film based on its own merits and qualities, without comparison to the anime, manga or other preceding content it was inspired by. A film, even an adaptation, should be able to be judged on its own right, without necessarily having to match or perfectly adapt it's source material. Hence the words ""adaptation"" and ""based on"" being used instead of ""directly translated from."")So... yeah. ""Dragonball: Evolution."" This film... happened. (I suppose that's the best word to describe it.)It barely broke even with its box-office numbers. It was a critical disappointment. And it was absolutely and mercilessly crucified and torn apart by fans of the source material manga and anime. Almost a universally panned (and then subsequently ignored) film, with only the rare supporter.But does it really deserve the near-universal hatred? It is really that objectively bad as a stand-alone film? Is it really only worth the current 2 out of 10 user-average here on IMDb?I don't think so. Oh, don't get me wrong. It's still a ""pretty bad"" movie. But I don't think I could objectively call it ""terrible"", ""awful"" or even ""patricularly bad."" This is just a plain, basic, underwhelming film that, while having a few cute moments, was condemned more due to its highly-regarded source materials than due to its own flaws.The film follows a teen-aged martial-artist named Goku (Justin Chatwin), who is sent on a quest to recover the ""Dragonballs""- mystical spheres that can grant a ""perfect wish."" He will need to collect these in order to stop the dark plans of the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters). Along the way, Goku also meets new allies who help him on his quest, including Master Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat), Bulma (Emmy Rossum), Chi-Chi (Jamie Chung) and Yamcha. (Joon Park)And I will give credit where it is due. I think all of the actors tried their hardest, and some were actually quite good. Yun-Fat and Marsters coming off as the best, of course, and both quite excellent in their roles. But I also found Rossum and Park very good in their roles, and they actually were my favorite actors in terms of casting. Both had a charm, and were clearly having some fun with the material. (Particularly Park, who seemed to really embrace the fact he was playing an anime-inspired character.)And there were a few sequences in the film that were genuinely fun, and had some honest thrills and laughs. They may not have been as numerous as I would have liked, but the film definitely had its moments where it gelled together quite well.That being said, this is still a flawed, messy movie. Ben Ramsey's script is very basic and cliché, and has its share of bland characterizations and plotting, which felt unnatural at times.And direction courtesy of James Wong (who has had some strong success with work on ""The X-Files"", ""American Horror Story"" and the underrated ""Willard"" remake) is a mixed-bag. While some sequences are fun and fast, others feel patchy and under-developed. And oh boy do I have to question his strange mis-uses of slow-motion photography.Still, I don't think these shortcomings really warrant the absoluteness of the hate this movie receives on a regular basis. Yes, it may not be good... and it's definitely bad at times... but not to the extent of the atrocious ratings it's damned with by many people here. And while I can understand fans of the source material having a degree of anger or loathing due to this evidently not being a good adaptation... I think it should be judged more as a stand-alone work. And as a stand- alone film... it's definitely a bit better than it is made out to be.I will give ""Dragonball: Evolution"" an under-average (but not terrible) 4 out of 10. People who are open-minded enough not to judge it based on its source material might wanna give it a shot. And people unfamiliar with the source material are very likely to be a bit more welcoming to its faults, whether or not they particularly enjoy it. (Simply because they won't have the ""disappointment"" factor that many fans did have.)",Negative
908,"Let me start by saying am 14 years old and since i was like five i starting watching dragonball, i really liked the show and when they announced 20th century fox was making a movie i got really excited because i liked the cast, (No i wasn't mad because Goku wasn't Asian because Goku is an alien not a Japanese guy) the posters and the director but when the trailer was released i was laughing my ass off at how bad it was and i noticed krillin wasn't there(i liked the cast but the main characters were in it so i thought krillin was in the cast too) so i lost my interest in watching it but finally i bought it yesterday for like 2 bucks so i didn't have good expectations but really the movie wasn't that bad in fact it was OK i mean everybody tried their best the acting was good, the director did a good job i had that feel like i was watching dragonball, the effects were OK, sheng long and the dragon balls looked awesome and piccolo looked really good but the dialogue was horrible it felt like a was watching a street fighter movie and the major changes weren't good like krillin and the oozaru (that was the worst part of the movie the oozaru wasn't even big it was just like a really big chimp) but really this movie deserves more that it gets and also i gived this a 10 because i wanted the movie to have a higher score common this should have at least a 5 or a 6 not a 3.2 (so i would of give this a 6)",Negative
909,"I watched DBZ growing up, loved it, and knew going in that this movie would not compare, just as a book doesn't generally compare to its movie. If you go in expecting a perfect match to the TV anime series, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a movie that will hold your attention (action, humor...even when scenes aren't suppose to be humorous) then you will enjoy the show. Yes, some of the special effects are on par with Sci/Fi TV movies, but they are definitely good enough to entertain. Not once did I want to get up and leave. Bad: The characters definitely feel a bit shallow (Picollo has like 5 minutes of screen time, total), the length of the movie is too short, the script needs a rewrite. Good: Actors did a pretty good job with what they were given.Also: 25mintues seems to have been cut from the Asian version, that I believe will appear in the US release. I've got my fingers crossed that the added content helps the brutality of some of the comments.Go see the movie, keep your expectations as low as possible, and I think you will enjoy it. If you are a 'hater' going in, you will be a 'hater' coming out. Very few movies deserve a 1 or 2 out of 10, and DBevolution is no exception. Decent movie, ignore the negativity.",Negative
910,"Let's get this clear, Hollywood butchers stories from books, games and anime like clockwork, but this is something else entirely. I was afraid this movie would not only ruin the Dragon Ball name, but it would misinform people who do not like Dragon Ball. There is a slight relief in the fact that whether or not you are a Dragon Ball fan, you will find that this movie is -terrible-.As the summary states, this is a train wreck; you don't want to watch it, but you can't look away. I expected the Dragon Ball aspects to be changed to the director's whims (which they were from story elements, to character uniforms), however they went one step beyond. This movie was completely converted into something far worse than even the worst 80's low budget kung fu flick.When you remove all the Dragon Ball fan service as WELL as any shred of a credible story, the question posed to the studio is: Who do you think is going to enjoy this?",Negative
911,"This is just an all out disgrace. I can't believe they did this to something that I loved to watch as a kid. Listen, this movie is so bad I'd rather watch the Ben 10 made-for-t.v. movie with my son 10 times straight before I watch this movie again, and that's saying something. Not only is it a disgrace to Akira Toriyama and his wonderful Dragonball universe, it's a really bad movie. Everything about it was off. It shouldn't even have been called Dragonball. These dragonballs sure do stink real bad, and collecting em all couldn't create a wish big or good enough to fix this.... Unless they remade this movie with A LOT MORE MONEY, at least 3-4 hours long, good director, better casting, rated-R or at least pg-13 rating, better fighting, better storyline, better dialog.... Effin' everything that would make a movie stand out, there's no way Hollywood should ever touch this or any other classic anime'. If Gatchaman, or Ninja Scroll are anything like this movie when they come out, I will definitely blow.",Negative
912,"Hollywood isn't exactly the greatest at adapting pre-existing material to the big screen. It seems that almost every time they adapt a franchise, it goes something like this: ""Hey there--you know (insert franchise's name here)? You know the fantastic worlds you found there? The riveting plot? The adrenaline-pumping action? The characters that you loved? And the themes that resonated so clearly with so many people? Well we're gonna do something totally different and call it the same thing!"" ...If you take the approach I just described, Hollywood, how do you expect NOT to offend people? I personally don't understand what's so difficult about adapting a pre-existing franchise. I hope they learn their lesson some day, but they didn't learn it in time to save Dragon Ball from being smothered to within an inch of its life by way of the movie, ""Dragonbal: Evolution,"" which is probably one of the worst attempts at adapting a franchise I've ever seen...and easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.I won't describe the plot because there are plenty of other places you can read about that if you want to, so I'd rather get straight to the essence of my review--the movie is marred by a script that was written without an ounce of regard to the themes of the original series...and this lack of respect trickles down into the production values, the special effects, the casting, the acting, and the directing. Dragon Ball is a story about a naive and borderline-stupid young boy named Goku who, in his naiveté, sees the world differently than most humans (in both a comical and endearing fashion). Despite his evident lack of intelligence, his pure heart gives him a clearer view on what it really means to be a friend, to be a father, to be a husband, to be a martial artist, and to be someone who will always fight for these values without regret. This confident, selfless, compassionate, and somewhat stupid boy's attitude changes the lives of the many people that he meets as a kid and as an adult in a story that is both moving and hilarious.So of course, what's the first thing ""Dragonball: Evolution"" has to do? Make him a socially awkward high school student who ""wants to get the girl."" They wanted to make Goku relatable, and that's the most critical flaw of the movie. Goku's not someone that people can relate to, he's someone who's supposed to be emulated. The theme that the writers wanted to tout was that this movie is a movie about ""having faith in who you are,"" which is the central struggle of the Goku in this movie. The Goku of the original series is someone with complete conviction in who he is, and it is this conviction that serves as the thematic device through which the story progresses. Had the movie kept this intact, I would not have minded some costume changes and crappy CGI, as long as they kept the essence intact. But, as I said earlier, Hollywood seems to have a phobia with being loyal to pre-existing franchises.As I said earlier, this lack of respect to the original message trickles down. The once-fearsome Lord Piccolo is reduced in this movie to a character with about four lines and no back-story. Muten Roshi is reduced to an over-acting ""you must learn, grasshopper"" martial arts master stereotype. The spectacular fight choreography of the original series is reduced to awkwardly-angled and hackneyed choreography where often you can't even tell what's going on. The fantastical world of the original series is reduced to a modern-day world completely devoid of t he imagination of the original. The series itself is reduced to a complete mockery of what it once stood for.Okay, let me back up a bit...I'm clearly a fan of the original series. Does this movie work for people who haven't seen the original series? Nope, unfortunately, it does not. Sure, the characters aren't loyal to the source material, but even newbies will recognize that the people they're watching in this movie are reduced to stock-type ""caricatures"" of other characters who have been done to death. The CGI and special effects leave much to be desired, there are plot holes everywhere, no back-stories are given to the characters...it's an unwatchable mess to newcomers and veterans alike.Hollywood...why? You had such a great opportunity in front of you. And you screwed this one up just like countless others. Just be loyal to what's already been done--it's not that hard.",Negative
913,"I was never a fan of the DragonBall (Z) show, despite the fact that I watched the first seasons. But because of all the hype the show gets Hollywood decided that its now time for a live-action DragonBall movie called DragonBall Evolution, which in all honesty is the most unoriginal title I have ever seen.Let me start of right away that even I, someone who is not a fan of the series can see that this movie has very little to do with the show or comics. Transforming bikes? Come on, is that really necessary? Also, for a movie about a show that is known for its large cast of warriors the cast in this movie is surprisingly small. The characters are paper-thin and the actors seem uninspired. Would it kill them to put some more emotion into their roles?One thing that I expected to be at least descent were the special effects, but no, they also suck. The famous 'kamehameha'-attack looks nothing like the one from the show, and the fight-scenes overall look dull. Its sometimes like watching Power Rangers but made by someone who just finished his study of Adobe After Effects. This is like a bad fan-fiction movie that you stumble upon on YouTube.If you are looking for a movie that is true to the source-material its based on, then avoid this movie because apart from a few character-names and a few trivial things it has nothing to do with the show or comics. Just pretend this doesn't exist. This together with Transformers 2 are easily the perfect candidates for worst movies of 2009.Now lets hope they won't make a live-action Naruto-movie...",Negative
914,"I have been WAITING for this app to let me write a review, it FINALLY is allowing me to do it. I have always love dragon ball, DBZ and GT. Super is out and that's great as well. Akira Toriyama's mind is amazing for what he has done. If anyone thought this movie was his doing, they would be naive and haven't truly seen the series. This is an atrocity to all that is Dragon Ball. Acting is mediocre at best, the script sounds like it came from a 10 year olds dream when they try to make it cooler than it actually is. No one in this movie even resembled any of the characters from the series (Even though they FORCED it with Goku's hair) except for Yamcha, that's EXTREMELY agruable. HOW did James Wong even get the approval for this movie??? All in all, this was a sad excuse for Dragon Ball.",Negative

Get all excited by trailers for X-Men (May 1), Star Trek (May 8), Terminator (May 21), Night at the Museum (May 22), and Ice Age (July 1), then THIS is the ""feature""?I guess Dragonball Evolution was based on some manga epic that got turned into a video game or TV show or something. If you weren't familiar with the original (as I was not), this flik doesn't go out of its way to bring you up to speed.The ton of money that obviously got thrown at the special effects can't offset horribly trite dialog delivered in wooden fashion by semi-competent actors or the half-dozen el-cheapo sets that look like refugees from the collapse of the housing bubble. Chow Yun-Fat and Emmy Rossum (Christine from Phantom) evidently try to be good sports by acting down to the level of the cardboard cutouts around them. Randall Duk Kim (founder of American Players Theater and the Keymaker in The Matrix Reloaded) is good as Grandpa Gohan, tho.The good guys (including 2 inexplicable Occidentals) are trying to recover all 7 of the ancient dragonballs that will keep the evil green-skinned Lord Piccolo from destroying the world. Piccolo and his henchwoman likewise use all sorts of skulduggery to claim the mcguffins for themselves. There's a fair amount of martial arts, as everybody tries to 1-up everyone else with how good they are. ARE they any good? Well, Chow obviously is, but everything else looks like quick-cut special effects.There's no need for anyone to issue spoiler alerts on this one, because everyone going into it knows exactly how its going to turn out.Frenetic, hackneyed, and preposterous tripe.",Negative
916,"For all of you who don't agree with me, sure the storyline was a little off, but if you think about it many people have only read the animes and mangas, but not a lot of people haven't read the original story. ""The Monkey King wreaks Havok in Heaven."" There is another movie that relates to that book its the ""Forbiden Kingdom."" Once you have read that story you will come to realize that the anime and mangas have been a little off the original storyline. As the movie it was good, If you would have stuck to the original, there would have been a lot of things that the director wouldn't have been able to depict in the movie. I am actually looking forward to seeing the sequel.",Negative
917,"I know this movie is getting a lot of hate from GB fans because many things were different from the movie and TV/comics series. But this movie wasn't really trying to be exactly like the show. For one thing, in the show Goku never went to school. In the movie he goes to school and thats where he meets Chi-Chi. Thats way off but not that bad. The movie is about Goku who who is set out upon his grandpa dying request to find the great Master Roshi and find all 7 of the dragonballs (he already has one). Upon his journey, he meets Bulma, Master Roshi, and Yamcha. They need to find the dragonballs before Picolo does or else bad things happen.The acting is kinda bad and very noticeable. The fight scenes aren't that great but its alright. The movie is entertaining and thats why its pretty good. So overall the movie passed my liking, being greater than that cheesy Street Fighter movie that came out this past February.Dragonball Evolution 6/10",Negative
918,"I've read the full series years ago but I'm not a big Dragonball fan nor do I care very much how close the movie is to the books. However, I do care about whether a movie is good or not. It started out kind of OK with a fun training session between Goku and his grandfather (shades of Karate Kid) and not long after with a clever ""fight"" where Goku wasn't actually allowed to hit the bullies because of a promise. I had hope then it wouldn't be as horrible as the reviews and trailer made it sound. This hope didn't last long as things progressively got worse and more boring. That fight with the bullies was actually the best fight of the movie. The few others were badly shot (especially the lava scenes), unspectacular and short. The plot was a mess of clichés riddled with unexplained happenings. I'm still not sure what the villain's motivation actually was.I didn't really care about the characters and the acting was nothing to write home about. I thought the guy playing Goku looked the part (even though he's not Asian) and did good until the last part where his acting was deficient. I thought the villain Piccolo looked cool (James Marsters always does a good intense villain) although unfortunately he doesn't do very much. The secondary characters were not particularly memorable, even Chow-Yun Fat hamming it up. With such an expensive movie (100 millions apparently), you would expect the special effects to be somewhat decent even though the rest might be lacking. Unfortunately,they were lacking in terms of quality, scope and awe factor. Too often, they felt low-budget or b-movie grade (witness a particular transformation near the end). If they had at least gotten the silly humor, the quirky characters or especially the fights right, it would have redeemed the movie somewhat, it would not have been such a loss. If you're a big Dragonball fan you are likely going to hate this ""evolution"", if you're not, you'll likely find it boring and senseless after the promising start. If your expectations are really low (and face it, they probably are), then you might find it somewhat entertaining. This is a poor attempt at bringing a potentially huge franchise to the big screen.Rating: 3 out of 10",Negative
919,This movie should have never been made. Thank god Akria Toryimia agreed with us and made Battle of Gods and Resurrection F. Hollywood needs to stop screwing up stuff that is better as it is. Heck this movie should be banned worldwide. Just so everyone knows I love the Dragon Ball series minus this god awful movie. This movie is worse then a lot of remakes I have seen. To me and a lot of other anime fans who love DB/Z/GT this movie makes us want to die or puke it doesn't matter which. I really hate this movie. I would wither watch Barney the dinosaur over this movie. I hate this movie because they messed up Goku. Also because they messed up all the characters and the events.,Negative
920,"As a kid I watched the cartoon Dragon Ball. Since it was a long time ago, I do not remember all the details. I only knew that it was a boy Goku has a tail that looks like Schwarzenegger in his best days and is searching for the dragon balls. In the movie Goku is the skinny young man (we have already seen that the movie will be bad, because the choice of lead actor was desperate), which has two problems. The first is that it bullied at school, what else is in love with the girlfriend of a guy who mistreats him. The story we've all seen a hundred times. Further course of action can be assumed. It easily beat the bullies, becomes charmer, and gets the girl. Yet finds out that his grandfather killed Piccolo. Then he tries to destroy Piccolo and save the world. The film is full of clichés, stupid dialogue and bad special effects. If something is supposed to be good in this film these are special effects. If you are a fan of Dragon Ball serial skip this movie, because it will not disappoint you. If you've never watched Dragon Ball skip as you will save 80 minutes. In any case, skip this movie.",Negative

922,"from the start of the movie, you can tell were most of the money went. I don't want to say this is an abomination, because there are worse, but, even as a movie I can't say its in any way good. The dialog is a little corny, the names are bad, and things feel a bit rushed and crammed. And if you do know the DB series, your gonna hate it. Honestly, if your going tot he movies, I'd say go see Fast and Furious. But then again, I guess its a matter of taste. The only thing I wish about this movie, is, it was the kind of bad that made it fun to watch, but sadly, the production tried to hard to make it a good movie with all the special effects and stuff they could afford. I think if your gonna cash in on Japanese pop-culture, leave it to the Japanese to do it. But then again, there are some anime/mangas that just cannot be live action. Anyone remember Fist of the North Star? Its a lose-lose situation for live action anime movies not made in japan. Don't believe me, check out Deathnote live action or prince of tennis and compare to the original source material, and then watch DBE and FotNS and compare. But to FotNS credit, it was true to the source, at least somewhat",Negative
923,"The movie seemed much shorter than it really is because it was constantly moving. There weren't any inappropriate lulls. There was some ""corny"" humor, but definitely not enough to spoil the actual funny parts. Great effects, of course. Bulma did a wonderful job as main character, although it seems odd that she becomes so comfortable with gokus presence in her life in such a short amount of time. There's a lot of parts that are totally unreal, but I guess if you're going to see a movie about machines that turn into rational robots, you can't expect too much reality. For those who tend to pick apart movies, there are a lot of unexplained instances throughout the movie that you can mull over later, but all in all, a must see in the movie theaters.

924,"Having seen only a couple episodes of Dragonball cartoons, I was not going to expect much. But I was able to see how the characters in the movie and action connected to the cartoon. While it clearly was not a great movie, it was not bad. Moving sometimes too slowly, we get a chance to familiarize with the characters and adapt to the strange humor. The action was so similar to the cartoon, it became obvious the movie was intended to be like the cartoon. So because of that, the movie-making team accomplished its goal.Yun-Fat Chow(Chow Yun-Fat to some) was by far the brightest star. He carried out the cartoonish characterizations of Roshi well enough, that he was so easy to love for his performance. Impish and strong, devilish and charming, I wanted to see more of him. Emmy Rossum was great to watch as Bulma. She truly brought Bulma out of the proverbial inkwell. She was the least cartoonish but I am sure it is because her character was the most respected by the other characters. Sure Roshi, Piccolo and Gohan were highly revered, but in a different way from Bulma. Just ask Roshi who he feared most besides Piccolo. I really enjoyed the chemistry between Bulma and Roshi for the comic sexual tension. Chatwin was good as Goku. I liked his sly, shy and quick sense of humor.The story was not bad. But I think the movie could have been shot a little differently so that special effects in the darker moments would appear more realistic. But then that might have affected the continuity.It appears a lot of the cartoon fans did not like the movie for one reason or another, but I say give it a chance. While the fans deserve to complain, they should also understand how hard it must be to bring cartoons to life. As far as I am concerned Bugs Bunny couldn't do it and Fred Flintstone couldn't do it. But Dragonball succeeded where others have failed.I hear there may be a sequel. If characters are not changed, I'll see it too. Dragonball drags a 6/10 from me.",Negative

Because I know how most of the big film companies work. They want to make something that appeals to a large audience so they can cash in on the profits. In doing that they always destroy the purity of the original story. I know that sacrifices have to be made. Not everything from the DBZ world can be put in a live action movie, but common. Why did have to make such a dumb movie with so much clichés? Goku a high school teenager with teenage problems. He get's trained by his grandfather in martial arts? Uuuhm...Karate Kid anyone??This movie sucks so much that I can write pages full of bad comments about it. Instead of that I'll urge everyone to watch the following youtubeclip, which expresses precisely what my feeling are about this movie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVnIRfYJWX0Watch it and spread this clip if your are also disappointed in this movie adaption.",Negative
927,"The summary says it all, this film is an entertaining abomination. Let's start with the bad... Most of the acting is awful, the writing is even worse, and the story is the original story only it's been ripped to shreds, which makes it become incoherent, especially near the end. A lot of things just don't make sense and there is no explanation for them. And this here is the major fail point of the movie... there are NOT ENOUGH FIGHT SCENES. There are like 2 or 3 fight scenes in the entire movie, and the best one is the very first one, if you've seen any Dragonball series you know that the main focus is the fighting, so why make a movie that lacks the main element of the original series? Even so.. I found the movie to be entertaining. Though the lack of fight scenes is heavily disappointing, the writers/director did manage to capture a little bit of that anime-type comedy charm. At some points you feel like you're watching a badly made anime.. but in live action.. which is pretty much exactly what you're watching, and that's funny for some reason.The special effects in this movie are actually fairly decent, though the ki blasts seem too.. ""gentle"".. almost like smoke, when in the anime and the games they are definite balls of energy, not just wisps. The kamehameha at the end IS kind of disappointing, but it could have been worse.My advice to anyone that wants to see this movie... if you are a die hard Dragonball fan.. don't see it. Or if you do go to see it, don't go with the expectation of seeing your beloved Dragonball remade into an action packed live action film of awesome or you WILL be disappointed and you'll probably want to burn the theater down. I watched this movie with extremely low expectations and I got some pleasant surprises here and there, but the movie was still bad. Even so, I'd watch it again.. even if only to make fun of it with friends. It really could have been worse.",Negative
928,"i don't really know with what to start the comment... first, Son Goku it's not at all the Sayan you know from the anime. if you don't see or heard about Dragon Ball, you will find that Son Goku from the movie (interpreted by Justin Chatwin in a stupid way, i don't want to say more about him, he tries to be a great actor, but he isn't ... sorry about the truth) it's a teenager who will save the world in 1 hour and 20 min. the action it's happening to quickly, the fighting scenes are awful in slow motion, some are good but only few of them, in fact only one : the final battle which ends in a couple of minutes. and if don't know the legend from the world's best anime... well, you will not understand much from this movie. the actors are bad, there is no scene well done, but i found it curiously entertaining. i watch the anime movies of Dragon ball Z, nothing compared with this imbecility... and wait, there will be another Dragon ball, but really we all hope they will make a great sequel. in conclusion, where the f... goes the budget of 100 millions $ ????? !!! try anything done by Uwe Boll, it's 10 times better... the surprise: it's not voted to be THE WORST movie ???",Negative

Unfortunately, my excitement over the fact that they are making this sham of a movie turned quickly to disappointment when I watched the first trailer. Nothing is faithful to the original series. Instead of trying to just put the show onto the big screen for fans and others to enjoy, they have warped it into something that doesn't even closely resemble Dragonball. For the many people out there who don't know what Dragonall is, I feel like this movie is just going to turn them against the franchise In just those few minutes of the preview, there are so many inaccuracies that I almost wanted to cry. Unfortunately, I probably will not go see this movie. Maybe in a few years, after this movie has tanked spectacularly, they will make another that people will actually want to see.",Negative
930,"Okay, so I knew this film was gonna be bad, but I didn't think they could actually screw something up quite so badly. I bought this from ASDA for £3, and I think I might take it back and say it was faulty, see if I can't spend that money on something a bit better.If you've no idea what Dragonball is (well, shame on you for one thing) or if you just wanna shove your kids in front of the TV or if you ever get given this DVD (in which case have nothing to do with the person who gave it you again), then I suppose it's one way to pass an hour and a bit. Another way would be to remove your teeth with a pair of pliers or maybe stick hot needles under your fingernails-both of which are less painful than watching this film.Firstly, it's awful. Characters, storyline, everything...just *shudders*...terrible is the only way to describe it. It's not like there's even a massive fight scene or anything, or that the movie goes anywhere-it just plods along at it's own pace and does it's own thing, and then ends. Goku is portrayed as your typical high-school loser who wants the girl etc (wrong) and then realises he's destined to save the world etc etc. Your basic crappy plot etc. Basically, don't watch this film. If you want to see it, e-mail me and I'll post mine to you for free, gladly, as it's a stain on my otherwise immaculate DVD collection.On a final note, why the hell was Mai working with Piccolo? She's one of Pilaf's people for shittings sake. And she kicked ass-that's not the Mai from the manga/anime!! And how awful was the casting of Yamcha who suddenly has shortish blonde highlighted hair and a face that'd been hit by a shitty shovel?!Any way, there you have it. This film sucks ass majorly.

(then they release another half a year/year later) Then they can skip some story and start some action on the next movie. Make some more movies.Go back with a flashback story in each movie,making people understand more and more of the story until it can just go on with the fighting and fun.I wish they could withdraw this movie,apologize.And start over. Find a freak of nature that knows everything about Dragonball,mix it with some matrix effects,and top it with characters that resembles.Believe ""Frodo"" in LOTR be black? or terminator without Arnold?

I looked on some sites and it seems that some people were saying that either Sean Faris or tom welling should play Goku. Sean Faris? Really? I don't think so. Now Tom Welling could very well do it however I think the hair would look out of place a bit and looking at him, he seem limber enough to do all the things that Goku is supposed to be able to do and yet he does have a strong-looking physique. Welling, doesn't seem to limber. Those are the 2 that I have found to actually look like Goku also.Some people are really mad at the fact that only a couple members of the cast are Asian. Well, as far as Goku, read the above paragraph. I haven't found anyone who is Asian that seemed to look like him. Send me a message of someone if you do. I think that it was more important to have the main character look the main character then trying to find someone who is Asian who doesn't. Chi-chi is think is perfect. Bulma, not so much. I think they could have found someone better for her. They could have gotten someone who would die their hair.Okay it's getting long now, Overall, I like this movie. There are some points where it get's pretty corny but what remake of a cartoon isn't at least a smidge corny. I think that if you never watched an episode of the show, you would enjoy it. I have seen about 2 episodes. That may be the reason why I like it. IF you watched it everyday as a kid, then you probably have something to say that you hate about it.",Negative
933,"Okay to start this off lets all give them at least a little credit here because lets think about it. Had they made the characters and the world look exactly like it does in the show it would be pretty ridiculous. With Goku's big hair how it is, Bulma having blue hair, and dinosaurs in the world, imagine how that would look as a live action movie. Or if they had given Goku his tail and made oozaru like in the show? The show was a cartoon/anime creating a live action version of the show is not the same as when they made movies of cartoons such as the Flintstones for instance. The movie is called dragon ball EVOLUTION. it's not going to be exactly like the show and there will probably never be a movie like the show so be happy with what we get.Now as far as the movie goes most people are judging it by comparing it to the show but lets throw that aside. We have chow yun fat, Justin Chatwin, Emmy Rossum and Jamie Chung (who in my opinion is one of the most beautiful girls out there) amongst other great actors. If you've seen some of their other movies their pretty good at what they do. So it's really a pretty good cast and the chemistry wasn't lacking in my opinion.As for the movie I'm not going to tell you the story line or anything. But the movie was OK, its not the kind of movie to be nominated for an award but if you look at it as its own kind of movie and not a live action of dragon ball then you can really watch the movie and it really is an entertaining movie. it's not the kind of movie that you will watch over and over again but its not a waste of time either. the script is pretty mediocre but the fighting is pretty good.so overall i rate this a 5/10. I'm usually can be a pretty harsh critic but i try to put myself in someone else s shoes. Too many people don't understand what it takes to make something like this and are selfish. but get over it people and give them some credit.***If in any way i have offended anyone with this review i apologize. Nothing i said was meant to be offensive in anyway. Just my opinion and review of the movie.***",Negative
934,"Somebody once said this was the biggest insult America did to Japan since Hiroshima. Hahaha, Anyways intentions were good but the Movie itself was very not good wouldn't waste your time just stick with the anime.",Negative
935,"If you have seen the original cartoon series, or DBZ, seeing this will hurt you. The story gets chopped up to fit in with the whole American typical high-school-teenager theme, and a lot of the original concepts get changed for reasons i can't think of except that James Wong thought ""well I've already ruined part of this, may as well go the whole way"". The only reason I didn't walk out of the cinema is because I paid to see it.Main points:-Goku's character is completely wrong, all goku wants to do is train and fight stronger enemies, and make friends... he does not care about being popular, or getting a girlfriend or any of that cr*p. Also the martial arts used are very basic. Lets finally mention, nimbus? power pole? no. -Oozaru is a complete failure. He should have been hundreds of times bigger. Also - lack of tail, full moon etc? Not just that but Goku cannot control his great ape state, let alone transform back. -Piccolo has no antennae.. also his back story is COMPLETELY wrong. -Grandpa Gohan's story part was all wrong. -Yamcha sucks. -Master Roshi was funny, and I've no problem with Yun Fat Chow but the role was really poorly cast. Also he has hair wtf?!Finally - THE KAMEHAMEHA DOES NOT HEAL PEOPLE!!! It would have blown a hole in his chest ffs.Wong, do not even think of making a sequel.",Negative
936,The movie is watchable but only uptil the age of 10.,Negative
937,"Not even Boll himself could have produced a worse adaptation of a beloved franchise. I'm flabbergasted its rating is as high as it is. Even the 'Super Mario Bros' movie was more endearing in its remarkable stupidity and laughably liberal use of characters. I don't even have fun mocking this film, that's how terrible it is. It's not worth examining to see where it failed, and it's not worth my typing this out. Manos: The Hands of Fate is a masterpiece in comparison. It makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock, Pierre Kirby like Shwarzenegger and Shwarzenegger like Humphrey Bogart.Don't watch it. Don't. Don't do it. It's the 'Jekyll and Hyde' game of the film industry.",Negative
938,"Let me start by saying that I'm a fan of Dragonball (the entire series, yes including GT) and I went to this movie not expecting to much due to the trailers and actors involved. I came out with tears in my eyes and it's not because the movie was emotional. I was crying because this was the worst possible destruction of a classic series. This abomination takes only names of the show and adds it's own story, which it wouldn't be so bad if the characters stayed the way they were in the show but the problem with it is that the story that is was replaced with is unholy.In fact, let me type whats wrong with this uneven mess: ---Horrendous, god awful, wooden, terrible acting coming from everyone involved in the production (Especially coming from Justin Chatwin and Jamie Chung) and the characters in the movie are so shallow and dumb and not in any way heroic.---A story so short, underdeveloped, inconsistent, filled with plot holes and not the least bit similar to Dragonball.---A frankly sad and ridiculous attempt at fighting is show in the film and all the fights lack emotion, last under 2 minutes and they're monstrously choreographed, fights in any other action film are way better.---Fake looking sets that have nothing in common on what is was based on and were to futuristic for my taste.---Cheap special effects that looked hideous.---An uninspired soundtrack accompanied the movie.---The direction by James Wong is the worst ever, if all that was mentioned above was any indication. I mean seriously Wong brought nothing out of the actors, took a very loose script of the show and made even more changes making it seem shallow, pathetic and bland, took away the spirit what made Dragonball great and inserted bad morals, made the characters nothing like show, directed the ''action scenes'' so badly, edited nothing that fits. He made a downright titanic clusterfck of a movie! Before I forget, everybody involved in the making of this turd claimed that they were fans when in fact later they come out and said the movie is better than what is was based off and called the original show childish and stupid. So much for the statement that the actors were fans.As you can see nothing good comes out of this film.It gets nothing/10",Negative
939,"I have talked to Japanese people who liked the movie. Basically people who hate this are people who did not want it to be made in the first place or people who have there heads up there own buts,who think they know everything. Come on some of the stuff in dragonball will not transfer onto the big screen without looking annoying and cheesy if you want that just watch the anime. The story in this was pretty good except for a few parts oozaru did not need to be in there because it was pointless,the high school part lasted like 4 minutes all in and even though it was funny because goku acted dumb even in school and when he beat up people it was gokuish and comical as well but it was pointless and there was no need for it.Piccolo and yamucha did not have enough face time and it had the most anti climactic ending ever it led up to a huge fight then just ended really bad but the kamehameha was well cool. OK i don't know if this is a spoiler or not but the end lasted for like 3 minutes all in and even though it followed the basic storyline could have had a better fight they punched each other like twice then blasted each other a few times. The characters were great i loved everyone of them i don't care what people say they all acted great. But the movie was too short that was foxs fault cos they cut out a lot of scenes which made it look choppy and left a few plot holes but even though they could have left in some scenes they cut out the parts we all hated like the 7 mystics part and goku infamous line 'im not ready for this' it was a good movie all in maybe some bits were stupid but it was fun and it did have a dragonball feel.",Negative
940,"Yes, yes I know. Glutton for punishment and all that. But hey, how can I resist a movie that has freaking Spike in it! I was actually mucho surprised at first. This movie is pretty good in the beginning. The actors are practically all unknown, but the music, cinematography and even directing (mostly) are a lot better than one would expect in such a film. The best part is the charming hokeyness that permeates everything, which can't be accidental. Total tongue-in-cheek stuff. I actually laughed a couple of times. I attribute much of this to Stephen Chow, who is one of the producers. I always seem to like what he brings to the table.To my additional surprise, I liked Justin Chatwin quite a lot. He seems to have a sort of LaBeuf-esquire likability. Goofy bugger, but you can't hate him. Two of the supporting actors were simply horrible, though, Chow Yun-Fat among them. Chewed scenery like it was going out of style. The other one everyone guesses when they see him. Jar Jar almost has a competitor now.It always comes down to CGI with these not-made-with-a-huge-budget comic/graphic novel movies. They simply don't have the funds to make it look good. And yet they always cram as much special effects shots in there as they can. Stupid-asses. Although, I have a suspicion that some of the crappy-lookingness was intentional, for comedic effect.Where the film really starts to suck mammoth balls is the last thirty minutes. Oh, boy what a crock of diarrhea. Throwing energy balls and flying is all good and fun for a while (only, not really), but I like my characters to settle their differences via the good ol' mano a mano fisticuffs. Cut the wires and get real fighters for the roles! But with some acting talent at least, mm-kay? So, this rating is basically awarded for the first half of the film, where everything is simpler and more fun. James Marsters is also criminally underused. He is Spike for cryin' out loud!",Negative
941,"This movie is based on Dragon Ball, a manga by Akira Toriyama. What they makers of the movie basically did was create a totally new story using the same characters of Dragon Ball ruining all the greatness of what Dragon Ball really was. They even modified the original characters changing their appearance, their background, and the way they originally behaved. Example: The original Goku is Cheerful, courageous, adventurous, wild, naive, loving, caring, strong. His grandpa raised him when he was a baby but died before Goku was't even a teenager, so Goku had to raise himself pretty much, in the middle of the jungle where he lived, very far from civilization. In the movie however, Goku, is not cheerful, lives in civilization, goes to school, and gets bullied by kids. This is only one of the many examples of derangement from the original story. Here are more Examples. Original: Goku throws energy blasts. Movie: Goku uses air bending techniques. Original: Master Roshi is old and bald, powerful, perverted, lives in a house in the middle of an island with his companion turtle. Movie: Master Roshi is young, not perverted, lives in the middle of New York, the turtle doesn't exist. Original: Goku travels through the air with the ""Flying Nimbus"", a yellow cloud he sits on and flies with. Movie: The ""Flying Nimbus"" doesn't exist. Original: There are Wild Dinosaurs. Movie: Dynos are extinct.The point is, watch the original if you haven't, because it's awesome and totally different. And then judge for yourself.",Negative
942,"A really lacklustre experience. I've never seen the cartoon and don't plan to but watched the movie with an open mind. The digital effects for one weren't great though not terrible either, the fight choreography and editing though doesn't work in many scenes and comes off as incredibly cheesy. It's not particularly well acted either with some very bad line delivery. The setting of the movie was very confusing too, it clearly starts in the USA yet suddenly there's an environment with loads of Lava and martial arts culture, what? Also are the characters meant to be travelling too and if so how? Even the costumes aren't any good and many of the high school students look older than me. Characters are not properly set up or introducd either, the villain is dull and the ending cringeworthy. I'm not outraged by the movie though, there's a few bits of humour, a fairly fun tone and a brisk pace, but it also leaves a lot to be desired.",Negative
943,"Dragonball Evolution ISN'T Dragon Ball at all; it's a cheap imitation of a MUCH stronger media franchise and fails to capture a fraction of its charm during its torturous 1-hour-30-minute~ runtime. I'm fairly certain the screenwriter never read the comic/manga at all and just read up on the Wikipedia entries on Dragon Ball without thoroughly studying what made the story so beloved and timeless. The same goes for the director too; the lack of care in this film is incomparable to anything else Hollywood's done with comic book movies, and for that alone I commend them for making such an embarrassing movie.This movie is a cliche-ridden headache that has quite easily become my least favourite movie of all time. It's THAT bad! The characters are total disservices to their original counterparts, the fun and pure imagination of the manga is non-existent here, the Westernisation of the settings and aesthetics makes Dragonball Evolution a truly nauseating experience. Also, the fighting wasn't NEARLY as good as it was in the source material; that and everything else.Dragonball Evolution doesn't work as a self-contained story, it outright fails as a Dragon Ball adaptation, and above all else it's not remotely escapist material at all; it's diverging from the source material and nauseating high school romance subplot makes for one helluva bad movie. Thank Christ it flopped at the box office.0/5 stars; I know, I can only vote as low as 1 star but by god this film deserves a specially designated 'zero stars' rating. I rarely think ANY film deserves to be discarded as such, but there you go. Dragonball Evolution is quite easily a contender for the worst movie EVER made.",Negative
944,"This is a monstrosity from start to finish. The story wasn't really entertaining at all, the acting made me cringe, the characters were uninteresting and boring and the action sequences were dull. Yeah there were one or two action scenes that kept your attention a little bit but everything about this movie just makes you want to try every method possible in trying to erase it from your memory. The writing is beyond terrible and the direction was just poor. If you have trouble sleeping, turn this on and you'll fall asleep within the first five minutes of the movie.As a movie reviewer, I have to be honest with you and with myself. I'm a fan of the television series and I liked watching the shows and when I heard that this was going to be released, I had mixed views. As much as I really wanted to like this movie, I knew that it wouldn't really be very good. I thought that it would be average or below average but I cleared my mind of those doubts before watching this movie and after watching the movie, I realised I was right. Dragonball Evolution fails on almost everything on so many levels and is truly a disappointment. The characters were just awful and the one thing that bugged me the most about this movie was Picollo because his make-up was awful, he looked really out of place in the movie. I'm actually quite surprised that Stephen Chow has made some great movies such as the unforgettable and funny Kung Fu Hustle and then takes part with this tripe. From cheesy dialogue and dire acting to bad special effects and dull action sequences, Dragonball Evolution may entertain the children and young teenagers and possibly fans of the show but if you're looking for a great action movie, give this a miss.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Negative
945,"They almost destroyed dragon ball. I can just watch the first 15 minutes... Everything is wrong in the movie... I don't know where the 100 million went to... I've seen better effects in non budget amateur movies. Goku a teenager? Are we crazy? Goku's never been a teenager, Goku never went to school either... And who decided to take out Krillin? Whatever, this could be minor problems if everything else was OK, but is not the case. Boring direction, cinematography and art direction... They just wanted some money and they made the movie without watching or reading anything of dragon ball. Hollywood is having a bad time, that proves it.In conclusion this isn't a movie, is an abortion. We'll just have to wait until Fox takes this project to someone with a brain (this could take 20 years...).",Negative
946,"Just to clarify: I've NEVER slept on a movie. Not even through some really bad drivel. Not even the unmistakeably awful. Not even through Titanic.But yes, the first time I saw this movie I fell asleep 20 minutes in and lost the whole showing. I figured it was because I was tired and had just spent a few too many hours awake, so I tried it again even though the little I could remember of watching in the multiplex seemed more like part of my nightmares.The second time I went to the cinema again (good lord I can't believed I paid this much to the people involved) and made sure to be wholly awaken to see the movie all the way through. 20 minutes in I realized (to my horror) that no, it wasn't a nightmare. What little I remembered of the movie really was what the filmmakers decided to commit to screen. Half hour in I was so bored I fell asleep again.Then now I have the DVD rental (it came free with other purchases, I still feel ripped-off) and promised myself I'd watch all the way through, so I drank nearly half liter of coffee and went on with it. By the time Goku fights Piccolo for the first time I realized no promise was worth it and just popped the damn thing out to watch something else.I'm not a fan of the Anime or Manga, so I don't feel exactly betrayed (ripped-off, conned and used, yes, but not betrayed), especially because I've always thought the story itself would never translate well at any degree into the big screen. But the Anime itself (at least the first series) had interesting fights and ideas. The fights in this one are easily the worst thing in the entire movie.The world feels like it is populated solely by the protagonists, and all interactions between characters don't only feel forced and contrived, but extremely unnatural to a point that not even blatantly reading the script and actively trying to act badly would accomplish. They must've made many, many shots in order to get a take horrid enough to put in the movie, because scenes that bad can't possibly be the product of a first try. The scene where Chichi discovers that Goku can manipulate Ki is unbelievably bad, but not in a funny way. It's not ""so bad it is good"", it goes beyond ""so bad it is horrible"". The story is poorly executed, the main protagonist is an unlikable blank sheet of a teen and by halfway through I wished so much that Piccolo was successful in his plan and blew up that stupid world that I just couldn't bear to know the movie would have a happy ending, and as such I didn't want to expose myself to it.Hollywood, you may have raised the bar showing that it can be done with Speed Racer, but Dragon Ball have completely stripped any doubts that Speed Racer was just a gigantic fluke way beyond your capabilities.(Gods, I still can't believe I've slept through a movie, or that what I saw in the screen wasn't a nightmare)",Negative
947,"Worst freaking movie ever! Everything about this movie is wrong and not right! This movie shouldn't even exist! If you gonna cast the characters at least cast them right!

948,"Everybody is so negative about this movie so of course I had to be stubborn and go see it for myself.I think everybody was (and is) expecting a 'Dragonball Z' movie instead of just Dragonball (without the Z that is). If you want to see a whole lot of rapid fire balls, instant transmissions, gallic guns, Neo vs Agent Smith kind of fighting and Super Sayins ...maybe DBE 2 and this movie is not (not yet I hope) what you're waiting for.This movie is based on Dragonball. The early years. ...A whole other story line but it's still based on Dragonball. And it wasn't bad. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. I enjoyed it. (maybe because I had no expectations, but still.)If this movie wasn't called Dragonball and had nothing to do with Dragonball, this same movie would have been rated 6 instead of 3. I'm sure of that.And of course some scene's seemed a bit rushed, and Piccolo's outfit looks like Batman vs The Matrix, and Brian Singer/Michael Bay would have directed the **** out of this movie. ...Ah well! Maybe DBE 2.So if this movie was an attempt to be like Dragonball Z then yes it's rated 3. But assuming it's based on Dragonball, call me crazy I give it a 6 because I enjoyed it.",Negative
949,"This is the first time watching anything Dragon Ball Z. I enjoyed the acting and script as it seemed to be alike to comics or Anime scenes. The writing was fun as there were a lot of times that it felt like anime, but with real actors and actresses. I don't agree with the low rating since this movie was entertaining and that's what movies should be. If you were not entertained by this movie, then it must take a lot more to entertain you. I thought there was comical scenes, loving scenes and really cool action scenes. The film was believable to me and I enjoyed diving in the entertainment.",Negative
950,"Other than names and likenesses, this movie used nothing from the source material and was a massive let down. It is 100 percent clear that nobody's heart or mind for that matter was in this film. It ruined Wongs directing career and made it impossible to adapt any film from a Japanese IP for at least a decade. This was a total cash grab by FOX and they basically admitted it. They had the rights, it was about to expire so they slid this absolute deuce out onto the silver screen. The majority of the budget was spent on marketing just so they would at least break even. This is all wildly similar to the story of how the live action Super Mario Bros of the 90s was made and received.",Negative
951,"I wish there was a ""0 out of 10"" option. If you are a fan of the legendary Dragonball you would probably know what I mean. Or if you are a movies-fan then let me put it to you in a more meaningful manner. This is a rape to the legend that is Dragonball. Why did the Japanese allow it to be made into a live action film still keeps me wondering. Even if you have the highest paid CGI studios, you cannot achieve GREATNESS that was DRAGONBALL. This is nothing compared to the original manga (comics) or anime series and anime movies.In the UK release of the DVD and BLU-RAY, the tagline or fun-line or punch-line says, ""THE KIDS MATRIX""Does anybody really know how hurtful that sounds ? Dragonball (comics and anime) came earlier! I'm a fan of the MATRIX, but where did all that influence come from ? ANIME! PURE Japanese ANIME! That's where film-makers refer from when they wish to create something fantastic. That's why MATRIX was fantastic. Now this movie DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION is far from pleasing any type of audiences.

That was sent to earth to destroy it, then came a old man name Gohan that found the child and the rest is history. Whats next Dragon ball z the return of piccolo, come on man you basically destroyed the dragon ball world with that movie. I think if you want to redeem yourself need to count this one as a loss and start over, go back to movie people and say with all the negative feed back we need to start over.

955,"From the moment your gaze falls upon the film's poster, you brace yourself for a comedic ride, anticipating the cinematic fiasco that's about to unfold. Venturing into the theater, laughter was expected but instead, I was greeted by a parody of Dragon Ball so audaciously flawed it borders on comic genius. This film attempts to ground the beloved saga in reality but strays so far from its inspiration it seems the creators set out to disappoint.Efforts to mirror Dragon Ball's essence end up resembling reflections in a carnival's distorted mirror: warped, bizarre, and unintentionally hilarious. This cinematic endeavor serves as a masterclass in how not to execute a parody, blending misplaced sarcasm, misguided satire, and a remarkable inability to hit any target. Those seeking laughter will find it, not in the script, but in marveling at how spectacularly this film fails to capture what made the original so great.In a twistedly ironic way, it becomes the perfect comedy: its misalignment so egregious, laughter is the only response to its boldness. With over 600 characters of critique, this review highlights the film's journey from potential to comedic folly, marking ""Dragon Ball Evolution"" as an unintentionally humorous chapter in the Saiyan saga.",Negative

It's a silly fun kid's movie, however bad some people may say the movie is most will agree the CGI in a lot of the movie is pretty good and shows promise. Sometimes the Acting was silly I did not like it when Goku started talking slow at a few points in the movie it made him sound stupid. Before you go to this movie please remember a few things. 1. Its PG not M or R so there is not a lot of strong violence in it. 2. it's taken from Dragon Ball not Dragon ball Z. Also to add it's not a copy of the comic it a different version with similar characters from the Cartoon. Like the first Xmen movie. I suggest you see the movie if only to bring up the figures so we can get a second movie and get to the good part of Dragon ball Vegeta.REMEMBER!! This movie is a ""silly fun kid's movie"" not a copy of the comic, books and some TV shows are always better than movies as movies are restricted on time and you can't not develop the story as much.

957,"By and large I think, Dragonball Evo was alright. It wasn't ground breaking, or necessarily a mirror of the original Dragonball series. It's quality wasn't exactly stellar either, though.I'm an artist, and a fan of the Dragonball universe. I wouldn't want to make a movie that was a mirror of what has already been made. That'd be like me trying to recreate the Dragonball comics. In terms of making a movie based on something as extensive as Dragonball, there are sacrifices that need to be made. There are over 100 eps of the original DB universe, and that needed to be shaved into a single movie.All the base elements are there. Roshi is a perv, Goku loves his food and rigorous training at the hands of Roshi, Bulma has capsules (which was her big thing in the original series), there ARE capsules, Yamcha is a desert bandit, Grampa Gohan raises Goku, etc etc. The base elements are all there, and the director deserves some credit for even making that effort. Not every director tries that hard.Now, do I agree with all the liberties with the characters made? Not at all. Roshi was a hoot, but wasn't a bent over OLD man. Chow Yun Fat did a brilliant job with one of the series' most memorable characters, but there were some aesthetic changes that didn't sit right with me. Also, no Krillin. Yamcha, but no Krillin? Dang.Ironicly enough, Dragonball Evo maintains the history of pacing issues renounced throughout the Dragonball universe. Except for episodes full of staring and gruntings, it was lightning fast the whole way through. It even felt rushed by the end.Riddled with flaws, and by no means the perfect take on the Dragonball universe, it was still kind of entertaining. :) It has all of the base elements necessary to make a Dragonball movie, and it's own unique twist of the story. They did alright, I think. :) Now they need to train their movie making skills to make a better movie. :) Train at 100 times gravity!",Negative
958,"Look, to those saying ""it's not supposed to be an exact copy of the anime series"", shut it. If you're going to put the NAME on the movie, then you have to do more than just take character names from the series and create your own story line.I also saw someone create a review who made a comment ""it's not supposed to be DBZ, it's just Dragonball."". Have you even seen Dragonball....EVER? Of course it's not DBZ, that would be stupid and make even less sense than the movie already does...but seriously, this movie doesn't follow a damn thing that any of the series depicted.I can't believe that a fellow ""DBZ fan"" ACTUALLY suggested I see this piece of garbage. I was literally stupified throughout the entire thing. I didn't think it was possible to actually feel PAIN from watching a movie. It doesn't matter if you compare this movie to the series or not, it was just plain awful. The casting was awful, the script for the movie was awful, the story line was awful, the action scenes and fight scenes were awful....just...awful.Please, PLEASE, if you are reading this and have not yet watched this ridiculous waste of time and money known as a ""movie"", HEED MY WARNING, it is unbearable, and painful. Thinking about it makes my body hurt, i'm not even kidding. Ugh, UGH, i've seen cheap, low budget horror films better than this. Has anyone seen the movie ""Squeel""? IT was better. I'm not sure I can even put my disgust for this movie into words, but I make this review in hopes that someone reads it, and avoids the urge to punch themselves straight in the face. UGH!",Negative
959,"First I want to say. Where is the evolution in this movie? Goku is already in a city at school and wanted girls not martial arts. This is very stupid they made character awful ""Goku and girls"" :)). Kame->Master Roshi is in center of ""lake"" in a big city and in a awful house. Then all movie was talk searcing and so on when at final with Picolo fight that was just an not a big effect then movie is finish and 85 min | 100 min (uncut version) of your life for nothing. To bad they done this to the Dragon Ball anime that was amazing anime and it is today. We hope that it will be another movie that is will be a very good one as the anime.",Negative
960,"Hey, I have an Idea, lets take one of the most popular animes of all time, and change the storyline entirely, because even though that plot line brought millions of fans from Japan and America together in loving one character Goku together. Hey even better, lets cast Goku, as this Skinny white dude that looks like a total douche the whole movie, in fact, lets change ENTIRE PLOT SEQUENCES and things from the original movie, cause who wants to watch a a small 8 year old kid beat the living hell out of aliens from another planet.... I was so disappointed in this movie I cannot even begin to describe it entirely. First off, Piccolo looks terrible, Goku is a complete disaster from the original intent of the character ( a warm adventure loving innocent child who gets into adventures and discovers the inner power within him to defeat evil) somehow gets turned into a 17 year old kid who gets picked on in school and has to ""play it down"" and let the bigger kids whomp on him to be normal, but yet still has no problem showing off even while having almost no real saiyan power.... The sequencing of events was just terrible, and a joke. I think the thing I have to say out of all of this the most is that I was so sad about this movie, I literally burned my copy and told all my friends to never watch it as it was a travesty of the original story.They should have stuck a little closer to the original story, and had some awesome cgi effects (which there were VERY little of) and kept Goku as a child to have that awesomeness factor of watching a kid beat the crap out of adults.In the end, I wouldn't recommend my worse enemy to watch this movie if they were in any way shape or form a fan of the original dragon ball series.",Negative
961,This is the funniest movie of all time. I would give this movie a -10/10 if I could because it's so bad it's good. Everyone needs to see this masterpiece.,Negative
962,"This movie was a slow plane crash from beginning to end.The ANIME in itself was sooo good that I actually watched the entire DBE movie hoping that something would relate to the anime,but that wasn't the case.I apologize to Akira Toriyama for whoever was involved in destroying his world famous masterpiece. The same masterpiece that took America by storm even before the pokemon phenomena.The 3d animation, the actors chosen, the setting, the story, the fight scenes, the kamehameha wave, the anticlimactic ending, the roles, the execution...all wrong, stupid, pathetic.I pictured DBE to be more like The Matrix series mixed with The 5th Element, Final Fantasy Advent Children, and the X-Men series. (remember when they removed Cyclops glasses and his eyes shot this huge beam and blew a massive hole through the building roof? THAT was along the lines of a decent kamehameha wave)But what do I know? I've only been a fan for 17 years. Not 17 minutes.",Negative
963,This movie is a disgrace to the dragon ball series,Negative
964,"Remember how the Dragon Balls work? You gather all 7 of them, and then the Eternal Dragon Shenron appears, and you can make a wish. You got that? Good. Now, hold that thought, because it is the only Dragon Ball-related thing in this entire excuse for a movie.Before this movie even aired, the Internet Movie Database was already full of negative reviews, so I didn't expect much of it. But even then, I couldn't imagine how bad it would be.First, I have to say that I am definitely a fan of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. It is absolutely a true masterpiece, and it made me love Japanese animations. You'd think that with such a popular show, Hollywood would try to make it even better by adding a 3D-effect to it in a live-action movie. But what they did was exactly the opposite: absolutely NO effort was put into this movie at all! The story and especially the characters are hopelessly westernized and some people might take this as a good thing, but it really does the story no good.There are barely any similarities to the original series at all. Not even the name is correct. The original series' name was Dragon Ball, but here, they somehow decided to make one word for it. Further, the only things that relate the movie to the source material are the names of the characters and the concept of the Dragon Balls. That's right, only the names are the same, because the personalities are completely different. Bulma is just a trigger-happy rip-off of Lara Croft who falls in love with some hobo (Yamcha), Master Roshi isn't old at all and he lives in some apartment in the middle of a city, Mai is suddenly a henchman of Piccolo instead of Pilaf, and Piccolo is a lame enemy you'd expect in a Cartoon Network TV-series like Ben 10. But absolutely the worst example is Goku himself, the protagonist. At first, I didn't even know it was him! Where they high when they chose Justin Chatwin to be him (no offense, he was fine in War of the Worlds)? Oh, and Krillin? He didn't even appear.The most important thing this movie lacks is RESPECT. This movie is really disrespectful. Seriously, I couldn't imagine what they were thinking when they made this movie. I wouldn't be surprised if James Wong made this movie just to make the entire series look stupid. It's like they put the original plot in their mouth, chewed it for a minute, swallowed and then threw it up. The result: I wouldn't even call it a Dragon Ball movie. It's rather a pathetic fusion of High School Musical and The Incredible Hulk. I can describe this movie in one simple word: DISGUSTING! This movie is just an insult to Akira Toriyama and DB and DBZ fans all around the globe. This movie didn't make me sad, it made me angry. I have started an IMDb account just to post this review. Hopefully, that says enough.",Negative
965,"I had a high expectations to see this movie but I was highly disappointed, it's crap, laggy and it's not amazing as it should looks too much drama's and Piccolo looks more like a power rangers villain, haters of dragon ball z will surely enjoy it or those who doesn't like animes",Negative
966,"Amazing movie, stuck close to the original manga and anime source material (I watched 2 episodes of Dragon Ball GT so I know what I'm talking about). A one of a kind perfect movie with no clear problems in my eyes. Perfect cast and very very accurate representations of the characters in Dragon Balls Z. Amazing CGI and amazing costume work. Deserves best picture and best costume design along with hundreds of other awards. I would give it an 11/10 if I could",Negative
967,"Honestly, i understand why people usually don't like this film. It has no faithfullness to the manga and anime, and it has a very lame script. But a long time ago, when i was a DB fan, i liked this film. I enjoyed watching it. And i also liked to see the differences between this and the source material.On the technichal level, it was pretty good. The scenarios are good-looking and the fight choreographies are pretty good.What makes me sad about this film, is that people hate it as if it was a second holocaust. As if this film caused any death. And they exaggerate. This film is decent, but honestly, i would watch it if the showed it on TV.",Negative
968,"Watched this years ago, and i STILL have things to say about it. 1/10 because this movie dishonored the anime's legacy harder than any villain ever could.the only thing evolving was my regretacting so wooden it made the sets look alive. It was like watching a middle school play, but somehow still sadderwhy did we turn goku into a high school drama reject?the hair didn't even go blondeoverall, dragonball evolution is proof that nostalgia can't save everything, and that not all wishes should be granted. The anime we love is screaming somewhere.",Negative
969,It's like the movie See you yesterday. That's about it.,Negative
970,"The only good thing about this movie is the Kamehameha and awesome technology. Otherwise Goku's acting was terrible.And even if this movie would be like a prequel to Dragon Ball Z. They should make a sequel to this movie where Goku became epic. They recruited Piccolo, Tien and Krillin. Gohan is born and Vegeta finally arrives on the scene and that Hollywood can finally find out what a Saiyan is. Oh yeah did I mention the fight scenes were terrible. Fights were too short and I wanted them to more epic. Well if you would even take the time to make a sequel and market it during Dragon Ball Z Kai or during shows with viewers who even know what a Dragon Ball is well then sure life would be great.",Negative
971,"There has been a lot of exchange between US and Japanese cinema. Seven Samurai and The Glorious Seven. The Godzilla movie that was more like another Jurassic Park with a Monster that didn't even look like Godzilla. Etc.But this movie. This movie is a absolute train wreck. Everyone who knows (not even likes) DB will tell you this movie is a train wreck. It is an insult to the intelligence of DB fans. There have been bad movies that, 10-20 years later gained entertainment value... This movie wont! It will always stay the steaming pile of **** it is. Self-respecting DB fans hate it and people who don't care won't watch it.Like Godzilla this movie has only the name in common with the original. The rest is annoying, insulting crap. DB fans just watch the trailer and as soon as they see Goku they'll know they hate this movie.This movie is so bad that despite it having already 407 reviews I took the time to register with IMDb and to tell you how ****ty this movie is. It is not bad (bad would be probably good in 10-20 years). It is pure, annoying, and insulting ****.1*/10 (0*/10 if i could)",Negative
972,"The story was definitely mixed up a bit, fusing some elements of certain points of the actual story so that they could be DONE with Dragonball and Work on with DBZFor all of you Whiney boo hoo babies out there that are mad about the changes...don't watch the movie because you simply will not like itit stays completely true to the series and adds a more realistic touch to it. and thats that. If you haven't already seen this movie and you know that you aren't expecting DragonBall 100% then go see it, if you want 100% Dragonball with all the goods then go make one and then lets have a chat. but as for me i loved the movie, and im a HUGE fan of the series, i can tell all the changes that they've made but hey heres the thing, WATCH the movie 1 time, then compare and contrast the 2nd time don't walk in all OMG this is gonna suck big time they spoiled DB for life",Negative
973,"The movie has not yet been released here in my city, I hope they do release it. As a ultra fan of Dragonball series , I really expect everything to be as same as in the series, I heard a lot of rumors during my survey that this movie is going to suck big time and stuff, but I really think in a different way! According to the survey, I came to a conclusion that Yes, all the characters and scenes and relations has been changed drastically but that's what director is suppose to do! He gave us Goku, Bulma, Piccolo and all the other characters back but just in a different way! Please, If you truly are a big fan then try to appreciate Wong's work. At least he tried..*anyone who knows about the actual release date for ""Dragonball Evolution"", then please let me know at my email address*- Thanks....",Negative
974,"In all the interviews before the movie was released, James Wong, Justin Chatwin and even James Masters told us how much this movie will remained faithful to the manga and anime, but also with an added bonus such as the modern setting and the realism so that it looks like it is set in the real world. Thus, I had my hopes high.Walking into the cinema, I sat down with my popcorn as the reel started to roll. A fast prologue explains that 2,000 years ago, the evil Lord Piccolo tried to destroy the world with the help of his monstrous demon, Oozaru and was only imprisoned by a brotherhood of mystics. The film then skips to present day, as young Goku spars with his grandfather. As a gift for his 18th birthday, Grandpa Gohan gives Goku a dragonball, briefly explaining that only seven of the balls exist and when they are united a dragon is summoned which can grant one perfect wish.Okay, it still sticks to the original story. Fair enough.But on the same day, Piccolo emerges, freed from shackles, with his lady assistant in an airship, trying to find the Dragonball. All the while, Goku is at a school party trying to woo his high school crush, Chi Chi when his grandfather is killed by Piccolo who couldn't find the Dragonball. With his last breath, Goku's grandfather tells him to find Master Roshi, who lives on a small island in the middle of town, and find the rest of the Dragonballs to save the world.Okay, maybe some few changes. I can live with that.Goku then went on a ""Wizard of Oz""-like adventure, where he seeks the Dragonball and meets a few friends along the way. At least the Tin Man, the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion have more characteristic and development than Bulma, Master Roshi and Yamcha.Everything happened too fast. Goku had his training with Roshi on the way to find the Dragonball and learns the Kamehameha ""theorically"", because Roshi just tells him how to do it and in the final battle, he did it.The actor that really (or, almost) lives out the character is James Masters playing Lord Piccolo. We can feel his anger and vengeful drive towards the Earth, though we still do not know why, or how he was freed. And unfortunately, he gets so little screen time that the movie-maker could have just use CGI and spare Masters from wasting his time. Chatwin was also a great actor and was a real Goku... if Goku was such a moody and one dimensional character.But I guess what save the movie is the special effect and the storyline itself (which is from the manga; the ""Demon Lord Piccolo"" Saga). The special effect is really awesome (no where near Transformers or Watchmen, but still); everything looks real. From the background to the slow-motion fight scene and even the Kamehameha. And the plot was also entertaining, although it could have been done way better.Dragonball Evolution looks like a very high-budget B-movie, or something straight to DVD or TV.As soon as the movie ended, I was speechless.But the there was a short scene during the credits. Stay if you want, but I know a lot of Dragonball fans would already know what it is.Dragonball Evolution; recommended....if you have never read or watched the manga or anime and would like to just kill some time off the weekends.",Negative
975,"Yun-Fat Chow! He must be seriously thinking about sacking his agent. An actor of his calibre in a film which barely makes up for the pop corn. You would rack your brains trying to find positives for this film. But then again, I must have known just by looking at the posters. Why did I watch it then? Well, because I have been watching Dragonball anime years and years ago and I was utterly disappointed even beyond the cushion of low expectations I prepared myself with. Yes, bracing yourself before going to the pictures isn't going to help for that film. The special effects were fine - in the early 1990's. The plot didn't do remotely justice to the anime. The director must have been taking the p**s, because you cannot seriously try to make a good film and end up with this.Avoid at all cost.",Negative
976,"OK that it is inspired on Dragonball, but the only thing that it has in common with the manga is - the Dragonballs; - the evil guy.All was totally changed, so much that it seems another Karate Kid movie: - the surroundings resemble 3/4 of the screen time a typical American neighborhood; - Goku is a pacifist-socially clumsy American-like teenager that wants to fit,'be normal'and know girls, but he is bullied at school by the super-clichéd group of tough & cool bad boys; - All the characters, minus the bad evil guy, are dressed and act like they have been taken from a typical American High School movie.Helloo film-makers, Dragonball is basically a Fantasy-Martial arts story!!! That's the least fans expect to see, not a covered up high-school story of a social loser that becomes cool.Yes, I'm a fan that is complaining, irked and disappointed for the waste of such potential plot. Even if I saw the movie mentally prepared to accept a deep change of the story (that usually is not per se a bad thing, because it gives a different 'what-if' development that gives new life to the merchandise), I was appalled by the common clichés and lack of creativity.So to sum it up: Unwatchable for the fan, poorly entertaining for the casual watcher, because of its unoriginality. Special effects and battles do not save the movie as they are mediocre and we've already used to see so much better.",Negative
977,"Firstly, this movie is everything it could have been: a ridiculous, cliché, poorly acted, completely nonsensical lump of a movie. The dialogue is stolen from every hero movie in existence, the acting is completely transparent and downright bad, the plot goes so fast and has no sensible path that it fails totally, the special effects are fairly boring, and the only good thing to say about it is that Chow Yun Fat is marginally entertaining.Secondly, that's why I enjoyed it. This movie falls under the category of ""so bad it's funny"" genre. For anyone who has seen the anime, many of you know that Dragonball is the basis for much of the things Americans hate about anime. The dialogue is mundane, the characters look like creatures from some other dimension, and the plot makes utterly no sense. No one ever seems to learn anything valuable, nor do their motivations seem genuine. The characters simply exist to provide a moment of entertainment, which they normally fail to do. And this is why people watch it: Dragonball is completely adept at being inept.In reality, I think that this movie actually intends to poke fun at anime and itself with how horrible it is. No one could take Dragonball into a movie and have it make any sense. Going into the movie, if you keep that in mind and know that it will be an hour and a half of pure stupidity, you might enjoy yourself. I certainly did. Don't take it seriously, enjoy the special effects, and don't think too hard.",Negative
978,"First, here are most things wrong with this movie: Let's start with Justin Chatwin this guy is a born teen idol. I could see all the little teenage girls screaming his name and chasing him like how back in the day they chased the New Kids on the Block. How does this make him Goku? It doesn't. He really did try his best to play Goku, and for that I won't degrade the guy he just isn't Goku not young Goku or any other Goku for that matter. If they were casting this fellow to get teenage girls to watch the movie: than their heads were in the wrong place. They should have been thinking about the millions upon millions of fans when deciding who to cast.Next, Chi Chi. She was written too soft. This was not Jamie Chung's fault this was the writing. Chi Chi was way more aggressive than this soft girl that knew how to fight. Until the very end, no spark in her. And even then the spark wasn't that bright.Moving on to the rating: PG? Really? What made these people think that this would draw a crowd? I started watching Dragon Ball in the late 90s when it first hit the US there are millions of others just like me, so what's the point in making it PG? I'm not saying make the thing R but they could have shot for higher! Next the writing: The dialogue sounded like a soapbox sketch that some lamebrain threw together in a month. Enough said about that.Then there was Yun-Fat Chow as Roshi I know they were thinking: He was in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but Roshi is old. Even in early Dragon Ball he is old. He is supposed to be Old Gohan's mentor Yun-Fat was half the guys age! They should have casted someone else. It isn't like Hollywood is running out of old Asian dudes just because Victor Wong and Pat Morita are dead.Lastly, someone please tell those lame brain writers of this film that the dragon freaking talks! And where were the other characters from Dragon Ball: like the blonde chick with a machine gun? Okay the pros: Cinematography shows what they spent their money on.The fights without Justin Chatwin were really neat as well.Emmy Rossum until she stepped into this movie: I thought it was going to completely suck. She really studied Bulma's character. She plays her exactly right and hopefully gets more acting opportunities in the future. That about wraps it up.Oh and please as a favor If any of you ever meet Ben Ramsey (the writer of this movie) please punch him in the stomach for me. Then say, ""You know why!""",Negative
979,"I don't have seen the movie and i will not.This is not a movie about the Dragon Ball saga, is just another waste of money by 20 century fox. Is a offense to the fans of the comic. Why? why is Goku in the stupid high school??? Does the person who wrote the screenplay knows something about Dragon Ball?? I really don't understand why is too hard trying to keep the characters as they are, instead of do meaningless copies. Why the hair of Bulma isn't blue? Was too much expensive hire the right hair stylist for the task? Why is Goku in the high school??? Also why is Goku so old if when he meets Bulma is just a kid? Why is Goku in the high school??? Where is Krillin? Why is Roshy so young? And why is Goku so skinny, pale and in the stupid high school???? My God! I can't believe the ability of the Fox to make crap of diamonds, they're absolutely very talented on that; the only skills of the producer is in taking bad choices, a stupid writer, the worst cast, and the worst make up. That was one of the comics that i wanted to see in the big screen since i was child, but this piece of crap just too far to be Dragon Ball. Stupid high school. Stupid Fox... Sigh... now i'm sad.",Negative

981,"I am going to try to show this movie wasn't that bad as they say, but annoying as hell.yes, I am a lucky guy I never saw the original television animation series of Dragon Ball Z, so I had no expectations at all for this movie. a friend of mine wanted to see this movie and because I like movies too, he asked me to go with him. we already heard a lot of bad criticism about this picture, but he was a great fan of the series, so this film was a must see for him. I went too, because that's what friends must do: go take the good times, go take the bad, and take it together.the movie started and he really was ashamed of bringing me to such BEEP, but I said 'hey don't worry, it's just a movie, I will survive this. after all, this isn't so bad.' and I was right. it wasn't as bad as Derek Jarman's 'The Garden', but it certainly wasn't as good as 'Monsters vs Aliens' (a movie I consider bad).the storyline was new for me and I found it quite amusing. however, after wards I heard this friend was so mad at the director to (in his own words) rape this excellent animation series. I didn't mind at all he was saying that, because I didn't like it that much.conclusion: I can say this movie has made me very tired. so if you want to sleep, don't hesitate and go see this movie.",Negative

We'd all let out a sigh of relief and rejoice.Worst line:Goku: ""I must become one with two!"".No Goku! No you mustn't! You need to have someone cut your tail off. What, you don't have a tail?

I have a better name for this movie, I'll call it ""Disgraceful balls of Emostuff"". This is my 1st time writing a review, which I don't ever do other than rate movies but this movie angered me to the point I can't take it anymore that's why I'm writing this review.

986,"Hollywood has done it again. They tried to copy the comic-to-movie craze with their tried and tested anime/manga-to-movie craze. Guess what happened? NOTHING. In the case of box-office flop ""Speed Racer"", this film inevitably jumps the shark with everything that goes wrong when adapting manga or anime to the silver screen; Hollywoodizing the source material, character personalities, right down to their names. Obviously, Hollywood has serious cultural issues. What a shame because it's one of the best anime/manga's out there so if I were you, I'd watch the original Japanese series over this one. Nobody learned their lesson over ""Speed Racer"" and sadly in ""Dragonball Evolution"", which should have been titled ""Dragonball Devolution"". It's one of the worst films of 2009 and a strong contender for the Bottom 100.",Negative

988,"I had very low expectations for this film and thought it would be lame but this was just ridiculous, almost painful to watch. Even 10 yrs will be rolling there eyes while watching this mess. Even if the title says ""Dragon Ball"" it seemed like the director didn't even watch any of the episodes of the original cartoon or even the manga. Also why is Goku a white guy? And to top it off there is hardly any fighting in this movie which ""Dragon Ball"" is notorious for and when there is a fight scene it's just dull with crap special effects, I mean the special effects aren't terrible but it was pretty bad. This is a film that everyone that hates ""Dragon Ball Z"" and just laugh at it and also at the fans, cause if you watch the movie before you check out the cartoon version, you will most definitely not even give the cartoon a try. It also probably cost a lot just to get the license to make this film from the cartoon, but the budget was way too low for this type of cartoon to film adaptation. If Micheal Bay made this film I think he could have done a better cause at least he had a bigger budget to work with, and that is a big diss to James Wong. This was a bad adaptation and a terrible script. I give this movie a 3 cause I seen worse and the look on Justin Chatwin was hysterical in every scene cause his impression is like ""you guys have got to be kidding me"" and kids under 10 can at least enjoy all the color and stupidity.3/10",Negative
989,"""Tried something different and heaven fallen apart"" well the above statement is for the director, story writer and casting manager. i don't know theses guys personally but had to tell ya all they have seen their last work. such an insult to to great TV series.Let me start off with the story, i don't think the story writer has even seen the original series thus he tried something different, could have been a decent story if the original series had not been made, intact had they tried the same story with different character name no one in the whole world would have guessed that they are trying to make a movie on the Dragon ball series.Second is casting well only one comment please watch ""Master youshi"" and ""Yam cha"" character in the movie you will get the complete idea as what went wrong. though the actors playing the respective roles tried their level best but it is the physical appearance that just the edge off. you all will have to agree ""Yam cha"" as a cool dude and ""Master youshi"" as mid age bit chubby person just didn't sound like them Well the fault of the director lies in not able to cover up the above mentioned flaws. the special effects seems OK in the initial 30 min or so but that also fell part as the ultimate battle between ""Goku"" and ""Pikolo"" started. back ground music was kinda OK but just could not do justice with the background scores of original DB series.All in all i would say if they had not tried to use the name ""Dragon ball evolution"" the movie could have done better as except for the name, dragon ball factor and characters name nothing else is matching with the original series not even the characters relationships.",Negative

Did they mean compete for worst movie in history to have a budget that big??? They knew it was going to be bad so why make this stupid film? They have ruined the Dragonball franchise and all the actors in this movie should be ashamed to be in some dribble like this. NONE of the characters portrayed even close to the original characters from the series and I'm surprised this movie wasn't directed by Uwe Boll. Oh wait one more thing, if for some god awful reason there is going to be a sequel based on the after credits scene, I will never watch another movie associated with any of these actors, directors, producers, distributors or whatever. And why the hell would you put another scene during the credits?

992,"this was the worse adaptation to anything I've ever seen. i grew up watching dragonball-dragonball Z and this was a terrible movie. first off to start goku is on his own since he was a kid. he met everyone in the movie when he was small, master roshi was bald, bulma had blue hair. they couldn't even get the basics right. then came the fact that this movie was so disgraceful to anyone who had ever seen any of the dragonball series. it looks like the director caught 2 dragonball episodes and thought he could try and make a movie out of it. if just wish someone who actually knew about the series would try and make a movie not someone who had no idea. the movie didn't even mention that goku was a saiyan. and what the hell does air bending have to do with anything this isn't avatar",Negative
993,"Surprisingly better than i thought it would be is the new Dragon ball movie. As i was a big skeptic i really doubted it could be done. As a massive fan of the anime i new that a live action adaptation would never be as good, But if you look at it as an updated twist in a classic it can be an entertaining watch. Chow Yun-Fat plays Turtle Hermit Master Roshi with out taking to much away from the well loved anime version. Since I have watched all the anime, and as most if not all who see this movie would know Our hero Goku, I was really not sure how Justin would play role. After all its GOKU! in the anime we meat Goku as a 12 year old boy, though Justin's Obviously not that young. Justin Plays an 18 year old version of our Hero who is still living with Grandpa Gohan (Randall Duk Kim) He goes to school where he is Picked on (cause Grandpa wont let him fight) by the Boy friend of Chi Chi (Goku's dream girl) played by Jamie Chung. With out giving the story away we can say that there's chemistry between Goku and Chi Chi. What would Dragon ball be without Goku's Arch Nemesis the Lord Piccolo who is in search of the dragon balls to make his wish of vengeance and destroy the Earth, Goku must find the 7 dragon balls with the help of Bulma who has a Dragon ball radar. All in all I would have to say if You are a Die Hard fan of Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, and Dragon Ball GT You will watch it even if you think it will be a flop cause no fan would want to miss a live action KA-ME-HA-ME-HAAAAAAA. for those who have never seen Dragon ball Z. It can still be enjoyed as a superhero movie.",Negative
994,"if you honestly went to see this movie and expect it to BE dragonball, then you were upset, i mean come on, its something new and MORE real than any of the episodes, yeah they did some goofs and I've seen every single DB and DBZ episode even the GT and this movie was great cause its real life and wasn't that bad of acting, i mean yeah they could of had 4-5 hours of talking....yes talking over 125 episodes of 291 episodes in DBZ was dialogue! and every dbz fan know that, and DB was just as bad,so imo this wasn't that bad and people need to watch it open minded and do NOT expect the same thing that happens in DB , cause i mean come on its a not a cartoon its hard to make people do that they do cartoons on screen and make it look very good. people can hate all they want i enjoyed the movie, and its 1 line jokes here and there,for a kid its a very good movie, for an adult it hits a brick wall of ""we wanted"" but ""we got this....."" like i said im a very big fan of the series and enjoyed the movie still.",Negative
995,"So why did I give it a seven? Because it was terrible in a GOOD way, but I really wasn't willing to make the vote any higher either.I went into the movie theater expected an absolutely horrible movie that would make my eyes BLEED. And I got that. I love DragonBall and DBZ, even though the shows really made no sense... I was willing to laugh at that. I was not insulted at all by this movie and I actually enjoyed it, not in a serious way of course. Of course, it's nothing at all like DragonBall... Maybe very loosely but nothing like it at all.I knew it was going to be terrible, and terrible it was. The acting, especially by Yamcha's actor, was horrible. The only exception was for Piccolo's actor - he actually did a pretty good job. Also, the women, all of them, all have very nice views of their boobs, especially ChiChi. I labeled her mostly as Talking Boobs. The whole movie was ridiculous and made no sense at all, and that's saying a lot given how little sense the show made.If you're the type of DragonBall fan who's willing to laugh at your fandom or you hate DragonBall, it's the perfect movie.But take note, if you are DragonBall fan... Do have some DVDs of the actual show waiting for you. You'll need it for healing. I may have enjoyed it, but I still needed to redeem the show in my eyes.",Negative
996,"The rating and reviews for this movie are too funny. When children decide to become movie critics, they really emote the STUPID, with no concept of what qualities comprise good or bad. Just check the reviewers that rate this movie with one star and see how many of them have only reviewed ONE movie; this one. Apparently the kiddies really like some Japanese comics called manga, or cartoons called anime, that this movie was based on. And since the movie didn't adhere to the version they like, they all got their little panties in a bunch.I've never read or seen another version, and having never seen anything this movie was based on, I can give you a clean review from an adult perspective.This movie was a fair watch. The action was good and there was lots of it. The writing was about what you'd expect for a movie of this nature; neither good nor bad. The CGI was pretty decent, and the actors playing the characters were all very likable and charismatic. And I must say, Jamie Chung is so good looking she makes me wish I was in my 20's again. I'd never seen her before and I had to look her up, but she's a real eye-popper. Faces like that always make me enjoy a movie more. Make no mistake, this isn't Casablanca or The Godfather, but rating it as average is certainly fair.And as for you kids that will give a thumbs down to my review just because this movie didn't match some cartoon version, you obviously have never seen a REALLY bad movie. If you think this was bad, you might look on-line and watch Night Train to Mundo Fine, Monster a-Go Go, or The Wild World of Batwoman (I think they are all available for free viewing, as nobody cares about copyrights on them). Those movies are truly BAD. Plots you can't follow, lack of continuity, microphones in frame, horrible acting, bad lighting and sound, and more clichés than you can name. Seeing movies like those can really give you some perspective on what's bad.Dragonball: Evolution just doesn't even come close to being as horrible as you make it sound. Sorry, but just because you throw a temper tantrum on-line doesn't make this a bad movie.",Negative
997,"I've been a fan of both Dragonball and Dragonball Z for years. While it was not the first anime I ever saw it did get me interested in the genre. However, when I watched the film I tried to see it from a non-fan's eyes. Sadly to say even with my blinders on the movie did not live up to my expectations for an entertaining film.The Good: In consideration of special effects the film did a decent job. The fight sequences were smooth. The make-up effects decent. Some of the stylized issues done with the film were interesting as well. I understood trying to make the film appear modern and at times this idea worked.Some of the actors did a decent job as well. Chow Yun-Fat played a decent Master Roshi and Justin Chatwin managed to capture the innocence of Goku. James Marsters did a decent job of Piccolo even if his screen time was relatively short. And Emmy Rossum crafted an interesting, but believable Bulma.The Bad: If your fan of the anime you will be annoyed to say the least, so I will leave that discussion there. If you are looking for decent movie you may be upset. The film is campy and reminds me of the old Street Fighter, Double Dragon, and Super Mario movies, but without the charm. The plot is convoluted and uneven. I understand that the world of Dragonball is not our world. Yet, I still could not suspend disbelief. the multiple types of creatures and characters in the film, an aspect understood in the show, is never fully explained in my opinion. The acting for some the characters is over the top. Yamcha's appearance and acting in the movie is particularly random. I guess to sum up the main issue, the film does not know where it is going. It has an idea, and even some of the skills necessary but falls short before it can fully explore those ideas. I'm not surprised considering how epic the show was.Overall: I think children will enjoy this movie. I think the lowering of the rating to PG will garner it some decent amount of attention for kids. The film may one day be a cult hit but I doubt it. Overall, I again think the film reeks of those films we liked as kids and as adults for childhood nostalgia, but will fall short for anyone over 13 years of age. Hopefully, the sequel will take the grown up route that the Dragonball Z series took. In other words: more action, simpler story, and less thoughtful points.",Negative
998,"I won't lie. I am a Dragonball fan. I've followed the show from the very beginning right to the end. I remember running home from school everyday just so I can catch DBZ when it aired. That said, my beef with the movie is NOT because it didn't follow the anime closely. I'm not a purist when it comes to these things and I enjoy quality in whichever form I can get it.The movie, for the first half was pretty fun. I liked seeing the modernized version of DB with Goku as a teen, dealing with high school bullies and all. It was pretty entertaining but unfortunately it only lasts for the first 15 or so minutes. After that the movie becomes a chaotic fast track.The movie moved too fast for me. It didn't really take the time to stop and take a whiff of fresh air. The gang is always on the move and it ultimately turns out to be a lot of crazy, inexplicable mess. Not to mention that it was extremely cheesy and too cartoony sometimes. It might've been nice for the little kids but those of us who grew up watching DBZ are grown now.The characters all turn out to be one-dimensional. There's NO character development from anyone's perspective. Goku may have had a tad bit of development but not as much as you'd expect for the main character. Especially when you consider the fact that the movie was all about ""Being who you are inside"" and all that corny mumbo-jumbo.The acting was... god. Justin Chatwin and Jamie Chung were the only ones who seemed natural. Emmy Rossum had great facial expressions but her voice seemed too animated for me. She didn't have any chemistry with the rest of the cast and sometimes I thought she may have been too uncomfortable. And DO NOT get me started on Joon Park. He was HORRIBLE. He reminded me of a surfer dude from a 70s movie(you know, when the acting was SUPPOSED to be campy). And as a Buffy fan, I gotta say that James Marsters was upsetting. He obviously didn't put himself into the role.The directing was lazy. Straight and simple. The only time it seems the director put forth the extra effort was during a fight scene. Everything else was... blah. But, you should expect that from a movie where there's no effort in development. Bulma and Yamcha's ""relationship"" came from nowhere. One minute they were arguing and the next minute they were having a one-on-one. Ridiculous.Overall, it was an EPIC fail. It was just a fail.",Negative
999,"OBVIOUSLY this is not going to be high quality film. I grew up with the cartoons and loved them (I admit I have not read the manga). Now, go into the film expecting to see a live action cartoon and you will come out fulfilling all of your expectations.But give an unreal ideal that everything you imagined and everything the story had piece by piece will be identical in the film, and you are kidding yourself of the reality of mixing media. It is not the same and cannot be nor should it.This film was made for a teen/very young adult audience (although my children enjoyed it). It was made friendly for families. They could have exploited the sex angle, and they didn't. Bravo for that.It is fine. It was entertaining. It was stupid. It was a movie based off of a cartoon ... really, they had to make changes to fit the needs. Don't go in expecting everything to be the same as you remember it from childhood (or perhaps for some of you, not so long ago), and you will be pleasantly surprised. Again, remember its FAMILY FRIENDLY. It is just like I said earlier, a live action cartoon with about as much depth.",Negative
1000,"Truth is, i'm a big fan of combat movies with tons of vfx. I agree with all the other comments, the ones who created this movie haven't watched enough episodes. The storyline and everything is messed up, nothing relates to the original anime series. It's like making a movie after a movie but all you watched is the trailer. This movie is not made for the fans of the Dbz anime series, even tho the creators probably thought they were making it so. The least they could do is keep to the original story-line, not just take the characters and make your own story (wich is worse). Even i would have come up with a better DragonBall movie than this.",Negative
1001,"Justin Chatwin stars as teenager Goku, who must use his special fighting skills to prevent the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters) from collecting all seven Dragonballs and using them for evil purposes. Goku is aided in his quest by master Roshi (Hong Kong action legend Chow Yun-Fat), school-friend and object of Goku's affection Chi Chi (Jamie Chung), gun-toting babe Bulma (Emmy Rossum), and thieving rascal Yamcha (Joon Park). As the group locate the dragonballs using Bulma's tracking device, they are attacked by Piccolo's sexy henchwoman Mai (Eriko Tamura).The plot for this live-action manga movie is all over the place, the acting is wooden and the special effects not so special, but I still managed to have some fun with the whole sorry mess, possibly because I had my expectations set extremely low after recently watching the lousy Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, partly down to the fact that I had no prior knowledge of the Dragonball graphic novels (and so wouldn't be disappointed by inaccuracies), but mostly because I was clearly in the mood for some mindless martial arts fantasy nonsense with several babes in cleavage enhancing costumes.And that's precisely what I got lots of silly kung fu action aided by wire-work and CGI and three hotties with their bosoms making up for their poor performances. Can't say that it has forever changed the way I look at film, or that it will even stay with me until the week is out, but I wasn't bored by its banality, miffed by its mediocrity, or angry at its inanity, which must count for something.4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for Chow Yun-Fat chewing up the scenery.",Negative
1002,"This was probably the biggest disappointment in a film of my life. It would of easily rivaled other movies based off classic toys and TV shows if it had a better director and was less corny. All they had to do was make it pg-13 and they would have been able to take out all of the parts that you actually feel embarrassed to watch, and add fight scenes that were a little more graphic and realistic. The acting was a little shotty in places, but with a storyline this bad it would'nt matter who was in it. The worst part though was easily put on the director and producers. Whether it was the obviously fake backgrounds or the fact that they developed and showed how the characters were so badly. Overall they should try Dragonball Z again, but should put on a little bigger budget.",Negative
1003,"I don't understand why everyone has such a problem with this movie. It's far from being the disaster that the Street Fighter movie was. I mean I have no idea what the anime is about or how close it sticks to it but I had a hell of a lotta fun watching this. It really felt like a live action anime. It featured a good looking cast, good special effects and pretty good fight scenes. Sure the film was silly and even less sillier than most animes are. It look a lot of getting used to to see what they were going for and truth be told somethings just work better animated. But all in all a very entertaining film not very deserving of the unfortunate rep its getting.",Negative
1004,Was going through my DVDs and spotted this as a red flag. Removing this from my DVD collection. Waste of space. This is movie is so far from capturing anything dragonball. They could have made a better movie with a bunch of cosplay people from comicon.,Negative
1005,"Dragonball has been around for 30 years now,it has become a cultural icon and one of the popular things just like Pokemon,Power Rangers,Yu- Gi-Oh!,etc.People who love Dragonball can make a better movie than the terrible movie Dragonball Evolution.The guy who plays as Goku Justin Chatwin seems like a miscast because his acting as Goku seems nothing like him.Th movie seems like it was trying to make a movie franchise out of the movie and change a lot from Dragonball. Like how Goku does not have a tail,Krillin is not the best friend of Goku because the movie made him an outcast,Bulma has one small streak of hair to confirm she is Bulma,Goku is madly in love with Chi-Chi even though in the show he doesn't know what being in love is like,and most of the characters and history in the movie is nothing like Dragonball.This movie is definitely on the list for worst movies ever and worst adaptions ever.",Negative
1006,"For the longest time I thought ""The Last
Airbender"" was the most insulting live action adaptation.They weirdly have a lot in common. But somehow the level of competency has plummeted even deeper! This is one of the worst looking films I've seen from a visual perspective. And the acting is an even further departure from the iconic anime characters they're portraying.This movie makes ""The Last Airbender"" and ""Death Note"" (2017) watchable, that pretty much says it all!",Negative
1007,"Yes, the movie is terrible from every point of view. But, when you accept that this is more a fan fiction than anything else, and it's one of the worst movie ever made. You start to laugh and have fun at how ridiculous it is.Highly recommend it.",Negative
1008,"Of all my time as a movie goer I have never seen a movie as bad as this movie and I've seen nights adaptations of avatar the last air bender. In my opinion this movie should deserve a negative 10 on stars but unfortunately there isn't that option and the only reason it gets 1 stars is the commitment James marster and some of the other actors put in for their roles. James marster which probably made this movie better than it originally was I consider him the true hero of this film. As for the movie itself the story is awe full, the characters except for piccolo are no where near as how they are portrayed in the series, the fight scene are incredibly cringe worthy. The writer only read a short plot line from IMDb before writing this movie because he was only doing it for the paycheck. A movie that can have the greatest potential in Hollywood is reduced to one of the worst movie ever made and probably the worst although birdemic is a close call for the worst movie ever made. When the actors says it's a bad movie and the director knows this movie is doomed to fail from the beginning than you know it's bad beyond reason.",Negative
1009,"Let me start by saying I never write movie reviews online, hardly ever even give suggestions to friends. That being said let me continue by stating the fact that growing up I loved this series of cartoons and got really angry when I missed an episode. I had low expectations going into this movie and when it was in theater my friends didn't want to see it so i didn't get to see it. But then it was only a dollar to rent to I figured why not right?Bad life choice. Movie was terrible, short, unfulfilled, not accurate to the cartoon version and left me feeling like I wasted my life. This movie's only saving grace was there were two hot Asian girls. I can't believe they made an 18 year old Goku!? At least get that right!! Well even though the curiosity killed the cat this time, I can safely say I will not be seeing the sequel to this (unless I get bored again and get curious) but honestly, terrible movie, don't waste your time especially if you were a fan of the original series.",Negative
1010,"Having never been exposed to the Dragonball franchise, this film could not ruin any preconceptions that I may have had were I a fan of the original series. Coming into this film with a blank slate, I was impressed and entertained throughout. The action scenes were good, Goku's character progression was well done and I even liked the song at the end during the credits. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to see a light-hearted action movie. Obviously fans seem to universally hate this film, but that must be because it is roughly based in the Dragonball universe, not a direct adaptation. As a stand alone product there is very little wrong with this movie.",Negative
1011,"i love all the dradonballz series, but this was a total butcher of the cartoon anime. i would of thought they would be smarter then that, goku should have been a 12 year old kid or something around that age. they could have made him right, innocent and strong or they could have least made him a super saiyan! idk... piccolo didn't look right, they should have made ALL of bulma's hair blue and made master roshi's house on an island, and they didn't even make shenron green! i would think that they would have been clever to not copy the dragon ball series and start at the ending of dragon ball gt where they left of...so no one could tell of their mistakes. i also thought that everything looked to fake, so i do advise that if you love dragonball anime you probably wont think this is better. if i am wrong then it is because i only saw this movie once when it first came out and forgot a few things, but a fan doesn't forget....",Negative
1012,"Good lord, this movie is garbage. I didn't even know it was a DBZ movie and I thought it was some crappy parody or something. This doesn't feel like a Dragon Ball movie at all. It feels like a rushed middle school project.To be fair, the writer of Evolution has admitted he never watched Dragon Ball, but I didn't think it would be this bad.The characters look nothing like they did in the source material, and they don't even act the same. Krillin is not in the movie, Roshi looked like a some 60 year old man wanting to be hip with kids, Bulma is now a bounty hunter? Since when? It's kinda sad how the only characters that were almost accurate were Gohan and Mai.But let's talk about the biggest thing they got wrong. Goku. He's nothing like the one we all know, he's apparently this socially awkward, teen womanizer that goes to school....You know the movie's bad when Toriyama himself also hated the movie.",Negative
1013,"One of the worst adaptations of a beloved franchise. One of the worst live action versions of an animated property. More concisely said, just one of the worst movies of all time.It is fascinating the changes they decide to make to the story. They do everything in their power to make this story more generic and less interesting. I want to be in the meeting where they thought having Goku go to high school dealing with bullies was a good idea.The effects are awful, the acting is awful, the story will take mindless detours that wastes the audience and character's time. Not being faithful to the source material is one thing but being this bad is something else entirely.It really is something that has to be seen to be believed. It is the car crash that you can't help but stop and stare. It is a disaster so bad, no amount of Shenron wishes would be able to save it.",Negative
1014,"so i just watched ""Dragonball: Evolution""... I'm trying to get the way I felt while watching this movie and I can only describe it as this. Imagine you're watching the worst movie you've ever seen eating popcorn. Then suddenly you realize that you're not eating popcorn, but your firstborn child. As horror sears this image onto your soul, you hear the faint sound of kamehameha and the complete annihilation of anything that was ever entertaining or held sacred by canon. This is a brief glimpse of what it is like to watch this movie. Now imagine you're me, who paid two dollars to experience this, and add the gut-wrenching horror that this 1.5 hrs of your life could've been better spent rubbing lye into your eyes. At least as your eyesight was burned away you would've seen something with a more convincing plot than Dragonball: Evolution.",Negative
1015,"The film tries to be a summary of what has already been seen in the first series of Dragon Ball, making several changes. Starting from Goku's training with Gohan's grandfather, continuing with the meeting with Bulma, Roshi and Yamcha, until the confrontation with Piccolo. The only good things that stood out are the design of the dragon balls that are good, some action scenes, some effects, Goku's suit that at least looks a bit like the original and at least Piccolo's design does make it look like an alien. Bulma's actress didn't seem too bad to me and Chow Yun-Fat is remarkable, but he falls short in his role as Roshi. There have simply been a lot of changes that make this movie very much derived from Dragon Ball. It had a chance to be something good, since it was produced by Akira Toriyama and Shaolin Soccer's Stephen Chow, but the director chosen was not the one. James Wong is a good filmmaker for having been responsible for The One with Jet Li and the Final Destination saga, but even so, he was not the ideal person to direct this film, since he declared that he had never seen or read anything from Dragon Ball, so I didn't know I was adapting. Unfortunately, this movie is undoubtedly a failed adaptation and a tragedy for an anime as emblematic as Dragon Ball. My rating for this movie is 5/10.",Negative

They took the characters, about 0.0001% of the plot, and sucked the soul out of the whole thing, firmly bending it over and totally ****ing it up beyond all recognition.Even people who have never had contact with the original manga and anime will say this is the worst movie ever produced.So much is wrong with it. It is impossible to defend this.please torture to death those responsible for this horrific cluster****I mean did they really think that fans of the original series would watch this? Any fan of the series would have walked out after the first 5 minutes(and i am being generous) and demanded a refund, and possibly compensation for severe mental trauma.BURN ALL COPIES, AND NEVER LET THIS HORROR HAPPEN AGAIN!

Perhaps it was because like the anime it got to the point a little quicker?

Overall the movie could use more as for what that more is who knows. I agree that Goku looked nothing like I expected him to.

1020,"I have always been a big fan of ""Dragon Ball"" and ""Dragon Ball Z,"" while ""Dragon Ball GT"" not sure if that will hold up well (Might need to have a look back at it). I have heard that this was first announced that Hollywood was going to make a live- action adaptation of not only the show, but the manga and I do not know if this movie was going to work because it might either suck or surprise me the heck out of me. As the movie was already being filmed, set photos were posted and we all thought that this movie was going to suck. Trailers didn't help, photos didn't help, or anything that was being marketed for. I did say to myself that if this movie was good its ""Transformers,"" but if its bad, then it is the ""Super Mario Bros."" (Referring to the live action movie). So I did watched the movie, and I was not the only one alone because we were all right that this movie really sucks so bad. If you think ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is worse than this movie, think again because I think this movie is even worse than the second Transformers movie, and I think that one is more entertaining than this pile of junk! ""Dragonball Evolution"" is one of the worst movies that was adapted from a popular franchise, which it has nothing much to do with the source material. If I mean nothing much to do, which now makes this movie a slap in the face to all fans, including myself, who all love ""Dragon Ball"" and ""Dragon Ball Z."" This has a butt-load of problems, and everything about this movie is all wrong. James Wong was not the right choice to direct the movie. It should have been Stephen Chow because he said that he was fan of the series. I never saw ""Kung-Fu Hustle"" but I still think he should have direct the movie; if not, then maybe it should have been the Wachowskis because they need knew how bring an artistic style for the visuals, and the action scenes like ""The Matrix Trilogy"" and ""Speed Racer."" The action in this movie are not well done because they are not that exciting as what the show did. If you have seen what Zack Snyder had done with the action scenes in ""Man of Steel,"" then this is what the movie should have because the action in ""Man of Steel"" were awesome. The story itself is not well written, and does have a bunch of clunky dialogue that doesn't seem to have a ""Dragon Ball"" feel. The special effects in this movie are not stunning to look at, and are not that impressive like the effects in ""Avatar,"" ""Inception,"" or any other movies that have great special effects. The acting is not really that good for most of the cast, but they at least tried. Justin Chatwin as Goku was actually not that bad because he at tried to be the character that we all loved, and I thought he looked fine wearing that famous outfit he wore during the last action scenes of the movie (As well as doing the Kamehameha). Emmy Rossum looks nothing like Bulma, and having one little blue color on her hair was not good enough. James Marsters did not do a great to play Piccolo, while the makeup itself isn't that great either. Jamie Chung as Chi-Chi was not a bad choice, but doesn't bring anything new to table except being a lover to Goku. Chow Yun-Fat playing Master Roshi in this movie pretty much killed his career. As for the rest of the cast, were all done pretty awful. The movie does have some plot holes like Goku transforming into an Ape (Which looks nothing like it) that doesn't have a tail, Roshi healing Goku with the Kamehameha that doesn't heal because it should have been Goku eating a Senzu Bean, and Goku's outfit not being ripped after transforming into an ape and going back to being human. The movie tries to be realistic like movies such as ""The Dark Knight Trilogy,"" ""Man of Steel,"" ""Arrow,"" and many others. This movie doesn't need to be, and there is no way that it can be possibly work. I'd seen movies and TV shows that worked better to be realistic while this and the ""Super Mario Bros."" movie don't work at all. I really don't like this movie, and I know that everyone has seen this movie are not completely satisfied; even Akira Toriyama creator of ""Dragon Ball"" and ""Dragon Ball Z"" hated this movie because they pretty much ignore on what Toriyama had in mind with his ideas for the movie. If you are going to do a reboot live-action interpretation of the show and the manga, then do it right as you respect the source material. Before I conclude this, I do like to say that the song ""Rule"" by Ayumi Hamasaki was actually pretty awesome because it does get the feeling of ""Dragon Ball."" I do listen to this song on my iPod, and I think it should be in a better ""Dragon Ball"" movie than this. Also, I really love Brian Tyler's score for the movie, which I thought it was awesome. So, yeah, those were some of the good things that I liked about while the rest of the movie sucks. Lastly, for right now, I rather go see and watch ""Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods"" over this movie that is trying to cash in with the name that carries the title ""Dragon Ball."" The new DBZ movie is animated, and it has the English Funimation Dub cast; go see and watch that one instead of this poorly adaptation of a movie. I never saw it, but I really want to. I give this movie a 1 out of 10.",Negative
1021,"Were there a God I'd like to think he wouldn't make people this dumb.This just the absolute worst movie ever made and I'm still pissed off about it 10 years later.The only movie worse than this is Transformers the last knight.I can't believe I can't rate this a 0.What's funny is the people that rated this 2-6 also hatred it they're just too nice to give it what it deserves. I clicked to read into the reviews cause I couldn't understand why anyone would rate this higher than the lowest possible rating.I doubt anyone even watched one episode as over half the names are pronounced incorrectly.I agree with folks saying you don't have to be a dbz fan to hate this movie. Fan or no fan, this was a terrible movie.",Negative
1022,"One thing about doing a live adaptation of a Japanese series is that the contents tied to the original series is often removed, and traded for changes that would hopefully strike a balance in appealing to the various different markets.This was where Dragonball : Evolution totally failed.Not only did the movie lose its fans of the original series through the various changes made, it also failed to impress those who are new to the DragonBall name.Dragonball : Evolution could be said to have no connection to the original DragonBall series at all, except for the character's design and name.In this case, the title ""DragonBall"" is merely used as a advertising tool, with non of the good points taken from the original series.If you are a DragonBall fan, you would be disappointed.If you are not one, you would hardly be entertained.This movie failed to show seriousness, but couldn't provide the laughs one would have expected even when taken as a comedic film.A prime example of a production train wreck that failed to live up to its name.",Negative
1023,"It is obvious for any fan of the manga Dragon Ball that the minds behind this movie where not also fan of the series, and if they were they never understood what made it special, unique and good. I'm not against change and I can imagine you need to modify a story to carry it to big screen. But still if you're going to adapt a series with such a big fan community, you need to keep it's essence.What ruined the movie for me was that Goku's background was raped and transformed him in something he is not. The hero we knew lived alone in the forest with his grandfather and had no contact with civilization, which made him goofy, unadapted to the world and funny. In Dragonball Evolution, we got a teen Goku who's worried about bullies, girls, etc. The protagonist we loved was completely inverted 15 minutes through the movie.Basically, the makers of this movie couldn't create an interesting DB universe because they didn't have the guts to capture the essence of Dragon Ball, making a movie we can only call a parody. As a fan you will feel insulted while watching this movie. First because it has absolutely no respect for the original manga. Second because you will notice a few details (Goku eating this big chunk of meat or running next to the car with a gigantic package on his back) that were good and have you think this movie could have actually been awesome done with more effort from the entire crew.Anyway, watch it with humor or do not watch it at all.",Negative
1024,"Everything about this is bad. I just finished watching it again because I was bored. It was so lame I couldn't focus on the movie. And as somebody who watched the show on and off for 20 years, I am not basing my views on the movie on how different it is from the show.This movie should have never been made. The world would be a better place without it.",Negative
1025,"I am a fan of Dragon Ball, and the is the worst thing I have seen in my whole life, how could he, how? This is not even Dragon Ball, no actor looks even a bit like the real Dragon Ball cartoon characters, no goku no bulma no piccolo no Mr roshi, this is fooool! Even the the fighting is nothing more than a little feminine kids trying to fight, and worst of all there are guns, oh my goodness. I am going crazy, and what, the f***in SUPER SAIYAN GOKU is bullied by earthlings, and who this actor taking Goku's role think he is, just give me one ***** reason why would this be goku? what a mockery, this is not dragonball story in any way, and if who did this is planning on another movie, he better not. Just if we meet ****** *****er. One last word, if you think you can't bring a fighting scene just like in the real Dragon Ball, I say you stay at home, don't think that because you added a good effects, this is dragonball, no no no. Thanks whoever reading this (:",Negative
1026,"I loved this film. It's so good. One of my all time faves. I enjoyed the King Piccolo Saga of Dragonball which is what this movie was adapted from. If you pay close attention they do have some stuff (or pay homage to) from the cartoon. It has a great message ""always have faith in who you are"" for kids and adults alike. I'm not too big on DBZ cartoon but this film I totally love. Cheesy yes. Bad? You could say. But I absolutely love it.",Negative
1027,"I really don't know why this movie got so much hate, the characters were lovable, the acting was great and the fighting scenes was enjoyable. Maybe it's because I'm easily pleased when it comes to films, overall it was, interesting and really entertaining to watch. I think if the film was made to win the hearts of the viewers they would've went above and beyond with the affects and all.",Negative
1028,"Dragonball unlike anything else is a show that is really meaningful to me, I GREW up just like millions of others watching this awesome show, i like millions of others became a devoted fan, Purchase the entire DVD collection also the anime movies, and every so and then i watch the entire 3 sagas from episode 1..When i heard of this movie coming up, and all the budget they were going to spend, I JUST SAID, please let it not be like Iron man, hulk and all the other money that were just made for the money, BUT I WAS WRONG, THis is not just a money, you Don't HAVE THE RIGHT TO MESS with something so precious to millions of people and corrupt it for MONEY.YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO CORRUPT SOMETHING SO MEANINGFUL, if i was a rich i would have send people to pay visit to the directors of this movie and teach them a lesson of respect..Another question, do the people that made this movie EVEN Watch the sagas? I feel horrible because i can't even express all the dislike i feel for this movie.",Negative
1029,"wow. how can i put this? it was just so bad. i love Dragon Ball Z, used to watch it all the time when i was little, so i know a lot about the series. this move was just horrendous, even i could have directed it better and made a better movie. the storyline is nothing like the cartoon. they tried to make it to modern, it wasn't kept original. they took the entire story line and flipped it, just tossed it away and kept the characters names, nothing else, nothing resembled the original thing. it was just terrible. the story line sucked so much its unbelievable. the special effects weren't that good, considering its 2009 and technology is just beyond amazing.the characters didn't resemble the real characters in the cartoon at all, since when did Goku go to school? since when did Goku meet his future wife at school and have a party? why doesn't Goku fly? why does he turn into Osaro if he doesn't have a tail? and the monkey looked horrible, usually the monkeys are giants in the cartoon, this one looked like a werewolf. theirs so many characters missing, the costumes where horrible, the hair, make up, everything. the scenery ware terrible. they tried to make the effects look cool, by adding slow motion and that, like at the end when Goku and chi chi fight, it just looked so lame. it basically looks like a movie you would see on Jetix, like one of those power rangers films, but even they look better.i was speechless when i watched it, it was so bad, i felt sorry for the actors in the movie, i would have been embarrassed to be in that movie. this movie just kills the feel of the cartoon, i was just shocked. the movie started and like 10 minutes into it, i was already bored. i wouldn't recommend it at all, very bad movie, one of the worst i've ever seen, 1/10, it gets a one for the effects which were average. Don't watch it, it's a very very very bad movie. needs to be remade by a better director and better casts.",Negative
1030,"I am not a fan, didn't even know what Dragonball was, until I Googled it after seeing the movie. But i am certain that if i was a fan, i would have been incredibly disappointed. Not only is the plot, the characters, the action, the decor, the costumes, the effects and even the music really bad, but they actually manage to screw up the obvious intentional humor every time.Even so, the movie did not bore or annoy me. It actually made me laugh, mainly at how bad it is, but still, it was entertaining to lose 2 hours with it on a stormy day with nothing else to do. Quoting from another person, you might really get a kick out of watching it while being hammered.",Negative
1031,"This movie is a total disrespect of the original Dragonball series. The outrageously inaccurate portrayal of 'OUR' Dragonball is just shocking, it has got nothing to do with the comic and hell they thought it's cool to add crap Hollywood elements into the film which completely destroy the untouchable classic. First of all, none of the actors resemble the characters in the comic a single bit and just when I thought they would create a cool looking piccolo, doesn't necessary have to look completely like the one in the comic but I was in for a rude surprise to see one of the best character in the comic looking worst then ugly duckling, not to mention that his role is literally non existence, same goes to the storyline which again has nothing to do with the comic. Without vegeta, trucks, red ribbons bots...etc was actually the best thing in this movie else the damage done would have been unthinkable and the director might need to look for a temporary hideout.",Negative
1032,This movie has no story and the Anime is much better,Negative
1033,"I went in to see Dragonball, not expecting much. The trailer already told me that the movie was gonna be very Americanized, have whack special effects, and a white Goku. Although it was exactly what I expected, the movie was still pretty fun. Everything was pretty lame, like the acting, the jokes, and basically all the characters. I guess the actor who played Goku got it right with the goofiness, but it still felt strange. All the actors were okay; they're weren't horrible like Street Fighter, but not ""great."" I felt that the actor that played Bulma the best out of the whole group. The actor for Yamcha was miss-casted; he sucked balls. It was weird that Cho Yun-Fat played Master Roshi and an older actor played Grandpa Gohan, when Roshi supposedly was Gohan's master, but whatever. Overall, the movie is just what you'd expect. The resolution and ""plot twist"" was kinda stupid, and was totally different from the Dragonball t.v. show. If the movie was at least 2 hours long (it was only 84 minutes, what a waste) the plot could've been better and stuff.",Negative
1034,"I think someone who has never watched the cartoons or read the comic book needs to chime in. A lot of these reviews are rated abnormally low because it didn't follow some story in some cartoon somewhere so I rated it abnormally high to come to the films defense.I enjoyed this movie for it's entertainment value and because I didn't have any pre-conceived notions. I wasn't expecting much going in and was pleasantly surprised.Justin Chatwin was excellent in this movie. He is a extremely capable actor who did a great job giving the lead role character and a cool personality. Chow Yun Fat did a great job as well giving the classic mentor/sensei role a great twist and humor you don't see in most cheesy video game/comic book based movies. Jamie Chung, who is absolutely gorgeous IMO, was reason enough to watch the movie. Her action scenes alone were much more realistic and believable than anything in that god awful wire-fu Chun Li movie.",Negative
1035,"I'm not going to say that Dragonball: Evolution is a great movie. Far from it. I haven't really enjoyed anything Dragonball since before Dragonball Z and its 10-episode fights and ****-measuring contests in the form of ""power levels."" But I always enjoyed Dragonball, the original creation of Akira Toriyama. It's ludicrous, but in a genuinely funny way, and despite the standard evil-doer-wants-to-rule/destroy-the-world motif, it manages to stay light-hearted and fun.Where this movie surprised me was how faithful it actually was to the story it's based on. Sure, characters are missing (it's only a movie after all, limited in time,) the Nimbus and Goku's rod are gone, but the characters remained fairly faithful to the original concepts, the basis of the story is here, and the settings are great. We get not only the populated areas but also the sparse wilderness and badlands the show/comic is known for. Piccolo's green, we get to see some Saiyan ape Goku action...honestly I don't know why actual fans of the original Dragonball complained so much.All in all, it's not great, but it's watchable, and fans of the original Dragonball should enjoy this as long as they keep expectations reasonable.",Negative
1036,"As soon as the theatrical trailers came out, I could tell that this movie was going to be horrific... but I didn't think it would be this bad...First off... the only things that resemble the manga/anime series... are pretty much the names (and the small part with Roshi's bikini mags). Other then that they butchered it.If you are a fan of the manga or the anime... then I don't recommend that you watch this.There should not be a part 2... ever. Throw it out... complete garbage. What needs to happen is someone that actually knows about the series needs to step up and make a whole new movie. Like the first Hulk... haven't watched it the whole way through yet because I keep falling asleep. But the new one with Edward Norton was great! If they actually make a second part to this movie... it will be the biggest waste of time and money. I would be surprised if they sold enough tickets in one day, to fill up the whole theater.",Negative
1037,"Adapting a beloved franchise like Dragon Ball comes with high expectations, and Dragonball Evolution fails spectacularly on every level. Instead of honoring the source material, the film delivers a soulless, uninspired, and utterly misguided take on the legendary anime and manga.The story is generic, the characters bear little resemblance to their original counterparts, and the action sequences lack the energy and excitement that made Dragon Ball iconic. The dialogue is laughably bad, and the CGI feels outdated even for its time.Even as a standalone film, it's a mess-poorly written, poorly directed, and completely missing the essence of what made Dragon Ball special. Fans deserved better. This is one of the worst live-action anime adaptations ever made.",Negative

1039,"Going over the reviews for the original DBZ, 2 things stick out.1) DBZ is written to be understood and consumed by 7yo and above. Not a criticism, just an objective observation, factual and verifiable (i.e. Rated TV-Y7). This movie only steps that up to PG.2) The awesome reviews come from nostalgic recollections of the reviewer's childhoods. You know, back when you were only pretty sure Santa wasn't real but just knew you too could one day be a martial arts master and superhero. Scroll through and you'll see they start with- I remember when I was 6, or- Started watching with friends after school, etc.All this to say, a 2 star average accompanied by such hyperbolic vitriol is the type of anomaly rating you get when you hit a nerd nerve, when you dare attempt to modernize stories of yesteryear that were embraced by nerdiest among us (not a criticism, I love nerd lore too;).Every comic book guy will come out of their metaphorical basement to say it's the ""worst ____ ever"".That's understandable, even amusing, but they're frustration is misplaced. Hollywood's attempt to reboot something fun from a then otherwise largely overlooked genre, should be appreciated, not derided. Not like this took away from some other anime movie getting made, as the years before we got the quality we have now have proven.It just wasn't time yet. The biggest mistake this movie made was not predicting the overly precious recollection of their target audiences childhood. That, and also just not trying very hard... Despite all the above, it actually isn't very good😂 It's just not NEARLY as bad as reviews make it out to be.I get it, it's a dumb movie, JUST like all things created for children (kids are great, but they're famously not as smart or able to understand the real world as well as adults), but that doesn't make it bad. It just means manage your expectations and know you're about to watch a 15yo live action reboot of a 30yo cartoon made for kids fascinated by super powers and fighting abilities that let them defeat their bullies in wild spectacles.If what you want is well enough choreographed fights that use unusual methods (like single handedly defeating a handful of attackers and destroying their car without ever touching any of them), and also still appreciate late 2000's CGI (not as great as today's, but passable), then this scratches the itch.If you grew up a diehard DBZ fan and want a movie that takes your childhood fantasies seriously to tell an adult story that adheres to your version of verisimilitude (which was as fuzzy as your understanding of that word at that age), then your nostalgia has set expectations that cannot be met.An adult giving this 1 star and ranting that it's an insult to fans is like complaining that the mall Santa is insulting your childhood memory of Christmas.It's a kids movie, get over yourself.",Negative
1040,"I have never seen any of the TV series but, I thought that this movie wasn't very good. In my opinion, they kept repeating the same thing over and over, getting very annoying. The movie didn't really expand on the story line and didn't have very much about it. Unless they'd advanced on the story line, the movie shouldn't have been as long as it was because it just dragged on. Many people may disagree with me but that is just my opinion. I thought the movie did have potential and opportunities but it was almost like they'd turned down every chance they got to make it a movie worth seeing. Unfortunately, it is not a particularly great movie and I definitely wouldn't rush to see it again.",Negative
1041,"I really advise the dragonball fans and even the ones who aren't to NOT SEE this sort of movie.I mean a sort of movie because this i cant rate this as a movie in respect to the movie industry.We all have reasons to be scared each time a live action movie sets to be released, and this one is the perfect example of why.I dont even have words to describe what went wrong because...well, it all went wrong.Storyline is a joke compared to our beloved anime series, the cast did an awfull job, it like they didnt want to be there, and i can understand why, the CGI was laughable to say the least.Even the DB Evolution writer came to apologize to the DB fans (it doesnt give me back the wasted time but at least he recognized the crap that was done in the first place)I can only see this movie as a barrier to not cross for future references.",Negative
1042,..and that's a good thing. The anime took what was great from the manga and dragged it out to a filler-slow dump. This movie on the other hand breaths new life into the franchise by re-imagining the story and therefore bringing new fans that probably wouldn't have stumbled upon the manga otherwise.,Negative
1043,"If you are a true DBZ fan, avoid ''even thinking'' about watching this garbage..... Its a shame too see such slaughtering of the original... This so called DBZ Action, Adventure, Fantasy film offers the following:-Lame action scenes... -Cheesy dialogues... -CGI from the 70's (for the power blasts).... -Unbelievable weak plots -Reincarnated Piccolo (''yeah'') -Inappropriate casting -laughable costumes -Filled with all the clichés you can imagine... And you know what the list stretches... But I am going to stop right here, and urge you all to watch DBZ series than waisting time and money on this Sh*T....",Negative
1044,"Dragon Ball is an epic saga of a kid named Goku, who travels the world to find 7 mystical balls of power to stop them from falling in to the hands of evil. In his travels he constantly overcomes his own limits to defeat any opponent in his way, protect his friends and become the greatest fighter in the world. It was a great anime that had many memorable characters and some of the most impressive action sequences on television. Dragonball Evolution on the other hand is an hour and a half of disappointment, watching as franchise that has such an enormous fan-base be ruined, losing all the charm that made the anime it was based on great to begin with.Obviously it's understandable for a film adaptation to make changes from the source material, but there is so little here that even resembles the anime that it's based on. It does keep the basic story the same. Goku and his friends are still trying to collect the dragon balls to prevent them from falling in to the hands of the likes of the evil Lord Piccolo. They also try to incorporate various other mythos from the show like the Kamehameha wave, but they fail at doing it well. All of the explanations of the universe and Goku's powers are rushed over so quickly that people new to the series will be lost and loyalists of the franchise will be annoyed at how poorly these mythos are incorporated in the film. Also whilst the characters share the same names as their anime counterparts, this is about as far as their similarities go. Goku's personality is changed from being a light minded fool who cares about only doing good and being the best fighter he can be, to being a typical teenage kid who spends most of the film having a crush on Chi Chi. Roshi's nothing more than a generic master who Goku finds. Bulma is just a Lara Croft type character without any of the attitude that made her character enjoyable. The character closest to their anime counterparts ends up being Lord Piccolo, since at the least he looks like the villain that he's based on. Everyone else suffers from worse miscasting than The Last Airbender movie with all the cast having nothing in common with their respective roles.It's also a dreadfully made film on a technical level, with director James Wong taking the epic world destroying fights from the original anime and turning them into amateuristic sequences that seem like they were made by a film student. They use a mixture of awful choreography with the fighters moving slowly and fast paced editing where each shot will last no more than a second at a time. Plus for a film with a 45 million dollar budget, the effects really suck. When the 2D cartoon that the film is based on looks more realistic than the effects do, it's pretty obvious that you screwed up. This film fails in every way. It won't appeal well to people unfamiliar to Dragon Ball since the characters and story are so generic, whilst being a terribly made mess of a film. And fans are certain to hate it since it fails to recapture anything that made the franchise great to begin with. It doesn't even feel like a real film. It feels like one of those parody trailers you see in something like The Simpsons that spoof how bad Hollywood is at with adaptations got turned into a real film. If you want to enjoy Dragon Ball just stick with the anime.",Negative
1045,"This film is just a horrible excuse for a fun action flick that happened to have the magnificence of Dragon Ball slapped onto it. I honestly don't think anyone who worked on this movie knew ANYTHING about the Dragon Ball manga or anime. None of the characters in the movie are anything like their actual characters. It also faces other bad problems, like bad acting, cheesy effects, a pointless love interest, and a crappy storyline. Also, the number of fight scenes is unbelievable. For a show that has so many epic fight scenes, you would think this movie would have tons, right? WRONG.This movie has like 3 fight scenes. Really, I counted. But it all comes down to this. If you are a Dragon Ball fan, don't watch this. If your just a normal person looking for a cool action movie, don't watch this.",Negative
1046,"100% opposite to the original story, who is goku Romeo?!?!",Negative
1047,"I too think the dragon ball evolution movie was a total failure. Nothing like the original anime series which i loved.The storyline was crap, the characters didn't match the personalities and looks of the anime (master roshi with full heir and way younger cmon!),i could go on a lot longer but i wanted to give my view on what could make a dbz movie work.I think they could easily have made a better or at least good storyline for the dragon ball movie.they could just follow the Radditz storyline for example: starting the movie with goku and chichi already married and celebrating the birthday of their son gohan, explaining of the dragon balls and piccolo, Grandpa gohan etc. in short flashbacks.. not like in this movie where goku is a geeky teenager who doesn't know his own capabilities etc! cmon he learned that along time sooner while fighting the red ribbon army and already having joined multiple world martial arts tournaments by that time!~ if they just followed the storyline of radditz/nappa & vegeta saga it would be way better, with a better cast and special effects, this could still make a box office hit wonder, since millions and millions of people in the world love DBZ! which child didn't knew about the series and loved it.. i can tell you as far as i know not a lot of people.and they could make it still so that people who never heard of it still understand it, by for example make a prelude (once upon a time.. etc.) where-after the movie starts.",Negative
1048,"Five minutes into the movie, i already started picturing James Wong's face and imagining how good it would feel like to put my hands around his neck and slowly squeeze the air around his tiny little head. that, in that moment, would have felt really, really satisfying. compared to the trauma i felt as i watched the anime i grew up with, woke up to everyday, begged my mom to stay up five minutes more to watch, and literally the pinnacle of my childhood, get raped and ravaged beyond any form of repair.i couldn't bear to watch the movie. if you are any loyal fan to the series, you'd know perfectly well what i'm talking about. it hurt so bad just watching it. words can't even begin to explain the absolute horror this movie made me feel. i felt disgusted as i walked out the theater. barely felt like myself for the whole week.what happened? why did they such a thing? why? the movie is beyond awful. the story was not a DragonBall-worthy one. i'd rather watch the Japanese version of Spiderman rather than watch this. the lead actor was a douche. why they chose him, i really don't know. thy could have casted anyone else and it would have been way better acting. heck, they could have signed the fat guy from LOST and it would have been a far better choice. all the elements from the legendary DB series were distastefully mutilated and crapped on. yes. crapped on. with matching flies and what not.i could go on and on and on about how this movie made me want to commit homicide and systemic annihilation of the cast and crew, but it would take me years to actually finish. bottom line is, if you've seen even just single episode of DB, stay as far away from this movie as possible. for those who have not heard of DB and want to watch this, please don't. Dragon Ball is nowhere near as lame as this movie. my heart goes out to all of us who felt like Goku was raped. i just wish the people who thought this up would suffer a similar fate.am i angry? yes i am. what am i gonna do about it? nothing. Hollywood will forever be Hollywood. uncaring. irresponsible. and inhuman. no thing will ever change.",Negative
1049,"This is not supposed to be an exact copy of the manga or the cartoon/anime. The side characters are eh... but they are trying to put hours of story in about an hour and a half. All and all it's entertaining and fast paced. If you miss 5 minutes of this you will be lost. The writing of the dialogue kind of sucks.... This was made and supposed to be the pre journey before dbz-ish story lines come about. The side stuff with Bulma and Yamcha sucks but they had to rush it for the time they had. Oh well, it's supposed to be like DB not DBZ which DB was more for kids and so was this. I'm sure it will get better. Worth a watch though definitely.",Negative
1050,"Dragonball may not be an epic masterpiece, but it's so much better than you'd expect after reading the fans' rants here. It's a fun little movie that does a good job in capturing the spirit, if not the exact letter, of the anime. While the effects don't stand out as anything we haven't seen before, they service the story well without looking phony, and although there are a few plot holes, it's nothing as glaring as... well, a large percentage of the other movies out there. There were a few things that were probably explained or developed in scenes that may have been cut to keep the length down to something that's closer to a pre-teen's attention span, but everything moves so quickly that you don't have time to really ponder those bits before you're on to the next scene.Justin Chatwin has a lot of charisma as Goku, and does a pretty good job with the fighting. Yes, he's a teenager in high school, but from a practical viewpoint, a younger actor probably wouldn't have the acting talent to carry the movie (think Anakin Skywalker in Episode One), and would be prohibited from working long hours and doing some of the stunts due to Child Labor laws. I wasn't really expecting to like him as much as I did. No, his hair isn't sticking out in two-foot long spikes, but that would have looked silly in live action. Of course he'd get his hair cut to a standard length, otherwise everyone would laugh as he tried to get through doorways.James Marsters is perfect as Piccolo. He's got the voice and the mannerisms just right, and has just the right amount of menace. Chow Yun-Fat is hilarious as Roshi. Really, the only actor who didn't work form me was Joon Park as Yamcha. He seemed to be just smiling and reading his lines, without putting anything of himself into it, and the character himself just wasn't developed to the point that you could tell why the others would trust him or why he'd be helping beyond anything that's just for the money. I can't imagine them being able to add more characters in, if they didn't even have enough time to properly introduce Yamcha.Yes, there are changes here, but actually less than most other big-screen remakes of TV series. It's better than the Wild Wild West or Lost In Space movies, but then again, what isn't? And changes don't necessarily mean that it's worse. The new Battlestar Galactica made Starbuck female, made Boomer not only female but a Cylon, and the whole mythos is different, but it's great. And some of the changes that fans here are complaining about aren't actually in the movie, but were just in the trailer, such as the mystics creating the Dragonballs. They don't say that in the movie itself.So if you go in without a completely closed mind, you'll probably find yourself having a good time. And be sure to stick around until after they list the cast in the credits for the extra scene.",Negative
1051,"No, I didn't all the other reviews but they suck anyway.Definitely not a 2/10 movie. Everyone who reviewed the movie need a slap. OK, so it was bad, but as bad as Bloodrayne? Hells no.First, it wasn't directed by Uwe Boll and as far as being a second rate power rangers? Who the f are the power rangers? I love 12 year old fanboys who review movies that didn't meet their exacting specifications.OK, so to actually review the movie you need to be aware that fox took the creative aspect into heavy consideration for the movie. Much of Dragonballs story has been altered to bring the movie to Hollywood, and some aspects make no sense whatsoever unless you've watched Avatar: the Last Airbender anime.They reference elemental attacks and the Kamehameha is an 'advanced airbending technique' which only makes sense if the Dragonball universe and the Avatar universe magically merge to destroy the Dragonball storyline.Taking the entire Dragonball series and setting it aside the movie makes almost no sense but is characteristic of everything Dragonball. They have essentially merged the entirety of the series into this one short movie which IMO isn't all bad.I could pick the technical details apart but in the end I was pretty satisfied with the first GOOD Dragonball live action movie. It is worth watching if you are a fan but be warned: it doesn't follow the story at all and many things are different than the anime series. Character names are there but that's where most of the similarity ends.I was only really disappointed by the tiny eternal dragon who somehow lost 99% of his mass in the conversion to film as well as his ability to speak, but having seen this one I definitely want to see the next ones.Dragonball Evolution is about a continuing evolving story and even though Hollywood screws up almost everything it touches they did an OK job with the first one and Dragonball is all about sequels.I would give it a 5/10, compare with 4/10 for Spiderman 3, 4/10 for Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull and 7/10 for Ironman.The reason it gets 5 is for the altering of the original story, the lack of explanation to newcomers that Goku is an alien himself and other mostly story elements, typical Hollywood 'movie magic' and a few groaner moments that make you question why. eg, 'Piccolo escaped his magic prison somehow.' I hope they do better on the next one but this one definitely felt rushed and pieced together by a child who obviously had no prior knowledge about anything Dragonball.",Negative
1052,"well, i wonder how long everyone will continue posting the same things over and over again. At this point most people are just venting. Its therapeutic I suppose. I guess many of us need this in order to come to terms with watching something so deeply routed into our hearts fall so fast and hard. Everyone is picking at one thing or another with this film and trying to explain why it ended up this way in the numbers and so on. But if you really look at the root of the issue it all stems from 1 miscalcutaion by fox.They were trying to make the film amiable for everyone but aimed the films production and story at a demography that was far to young for the general public to take seriously. The movie is fine if you look at it from a 10 year olds eyes. The youngest viewers don't read to much into it. So the story ends up full of potholes, lackluster dialogue, and childproof fight scenes and effects.In turn, the actual critiquing populous can only rate the film from their point of view rather than looking at it as a children's film. The script was aimed at very young boys but by it was promoted as a film for the general masses. Why not, its a billion dollar franchise that has lasted 20 years so it has to have a diverse audience to begin with. There wouldn't be to much work involved to convince ppl to watch it. But, after the first people watched it they didn't return to the theaters and told others it wasn't worth going. In general Only the 10 year old boys that it was aimed at may have been willing to go see it again and they don't have any money or a deep set love for the series since it is before their time.It doesn't seem as if fox realized the people who grew up with this stuff from 15 to 5 years ago were now at minimum in their teens. also, Writing and directing a script that limits its vantage point for they eyes of pre-pubescent boys severely limits the range of people that would be willing to watch the film or even give it a decent review.but Oh, well. rather then trying to understand where they started to take the wrong turns.. They just look at the numbers. so getting a reboot or sequel with a larger budget for better production may be out of the question. Because to them it is our fault it didn't do very well. We are the ones that didn't go see it or see it more than once so those numbers suggest that we just didn't want dragon ball on the big screen. It doesn't have anything to do with fox getting the driving factors behind the anime and manga right. They could have written a completely different and new story but keep the characters personalities and motivations intact and it would have still been dragonball. But they chose not to do that. The story was difficult to follow the main character was a completely different person personality-wise and the epic earth shattering action scenes that made the series were non existent.",Negative
1053,"NO NO NO NO NO! Unbelievable! How could anyone think this was a good idea. I don't even want to go into the plot. So I'm just going to try and get off this crappy film and try and review it as fast as possible for people thinking of watching this.The acting is god awful. Wrong casting everywhere. Bulma doesn't have blue hair and acts NOTHING like she did in the original. Nobody is right in this atrocity. A fact: The director didn't watch dragon ball z at all. It's always a good idea to give a director who doesn't know anything about the franchise to direct the film. Bloody brilliant. The effects. Oh those low budget effects. Two words: Hand Fart. Kamehameha looks like a freaking blue air pulse thing, and nothing about the moves had their explosive effect as they did in the original. The cgi sweat is plain embarrassing and I'm sure I could do better by inserting spheres in blender and covering them with stock footage textures.I'm not sure what they were thinking, but for the love of god: DO NOT MAKE A ANIME A LIVE ACTION FILM!",Negative

1055,"Director: James Wong Actors: Justin Chatwin, Yun-Fat Chow, Emmy Rossum, James MarstersCharacters: Goku(Justin), Roshi(Yun-Fat), Bulma(Emmy),Piccolo(James)Genre: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, Comedy Feature Length: 100 minutesRated: PG (Mild Action Violence, Infrequent Coarse Language)This movie was a modern version of the original Drangonball series revised into a 100 minute film. Director James Wong who also directed other hit movies for example, Final Destination, Final Destination 3, The One etc, did an amazing job in recreating the Dragonball story, while featuring well-preformed actors, like Justin Chatwin (Goku) who also plays as Robbie in War of the Worlds and Nick Powell in The Invisible. Emmy Rossum (Bulma) who also played as Christine Daaé in The Phantom Of The Opera, and Laura Chapman in The Day After Tomorrow.Although this movie was not exactly like the original manga storyline, it does not mean it is a let down. This new modern story was an interesting change for the original. Instead of Goku being being a dumb nut, he attended school. Instead of Goku being a little 12-15 year old immature child, he was an 18 years old, and more mature. Because the focus audience is still for children/teens, it focuses on modern problems in children/teen life, one is the bully problem at schools, Goku was not a well loved student in the film, but rather one of the victims of bullying. It also shows teenage love, like how they are shy to start of with but gain confidence throughout the story. Dragonball Evolution relates to the audience more then the original story.The Fight scenes were a combination of The Matrix and The One, which is quite a good mix, and is worth seeing. The effects were well done. It was still funny and silly like the series. While relating the series to modern time.Overall the movie was great, and worth watching. The Fighting is great, the relation from the movie to the audience was well done, it was funny and the cast was perfect. I would suggest this movie to people that are into Dragonball, that would not mind a change in the original story.",Negative
1056,"This movie is a complete disaster. Along with Street Fighter is one of the worse movies I've seen in my whole life. I never watched a full episode of the original series, but I've seen parts of it. This movie destroy the series. How can it be so bad? Well, in my opinion, the director never watched the series either. I saw this film with some friends and we were laughing at it, though it's not a comedy. The special effects were lame and so the actors. If it had been take seriously, maybe it would really be a good movie to watch in DVD. This movie can be only watched during a day of winter, you are locked, only one channel is working on your TV and it's TNT. So, if you don't want to waste time of your life, please don't watch this!",Negative
1057,"Why Akira Toriyama permit this nonsense?
The worst of the worst of the worst
Im a huge dragon ball fan, but this movie is an insult
I think you screenwriter must do better than this
Really i preffer put my money on to a bag and trow to a river",Negative
1058,"As a fan of the show in my youth, I once upon a time thought a live-action DragonBall movie would be awesome. I was twelve, please forgive me. Upon seeing the first trailers for this movie, I knew how wrong I was. Fantasy elements such as those in DragonBall just didn't seem to work in a live-action setting. Now that DBE is available for rental, I had to pick it up just to see how bad it came out. I am legitimately astonished. While DBE is certainly a bad movie, it somehow manages to avoid being terrible, which is more credit than I ever thought I'd give it.DragonBall Evolution is far from faithful to the source material, although nostaligia certainly was evoked. The dark lord Piccolo has managed to break out of his seal, and is hunting for the DragonBall's such that he can wish himself back into power. One of these dragonballs belongs to Goku, a geeky teenager who lives with his grandpa and trains in the martial arts, including some wacky airbending stuff and the word ""ki"". When Piccolo kills Goku's grandfather, Goku and fellow dragonball holder Bulma go on the run to find Master Roshi and stop Piccolo. Oh, and for Goku to woo hot fighter chick ChiChi.Certain elements from the old cartoons come across very well with live actors. Bulma's motorcycle-in-a-capsule is certainly quite awesome. But for every plus, there's five problems. Goku in high-school is almost insulting to the fans. The airbending techniques come across as a little too sci-fi since the world is made to look a little more realistic than in the cartoons (we accepted it there in a world where a dog was a police captain).Some of the biggest problems lie in the characters. Chow Yun Fat ostensibly brings some level of respect to the movie, but its one of his worst performances. In one moment where he celebrates a victory, he acts like Roshi straight out of the cartoon, something that doesn't work in live-action. Emmy Rossum really should be getting better roles than Bulma, and Bulma herself is made more action-oriented to fit in with the boys (although she's the only protagonist to play with guns). Joon Park is annoying as all hell as Yamcha, a Korean thief who talks like a surfer. Jamie Chung is definitely the hotter than anyone would have imagined ChiChi, but since when was ChiChi a fighter? Chatwin is decently likable, although the implications of a white Goku are a little unfortunate.Action is of course what the movie is about, seeing as the series prided itself on five-episode long fight sequences. The beginning scenes are quite awful, such as Goku's fight with high school bullies, with overuse of slow-mo. After that, the fights are a little more fluid and enjoyable, although far from memorable. But hey, we get to see Chow Yun Fat beat up the kid from War of the Worlds, which almost makes it worth it.In spite of how easy it is to rip on, DragonBall Evolution was much more enjoyable than I expected. There's a lot of groaners, but less than I expected. Maybe its just low expectations, but I got a lot more out of DBE than I expected. Granted, I expected it to be a zero-star affair, and it managed a whole two. Good for it. But from now on, realise the limitations of adapting cartoons to live action. This movie will be too out-there for non-fans, and the fans will absolutely hate it. Moderate fans looking for nostalgia, such as myself, are really the sole audience for this.",Negative
1059,"I had really low expectations for this so I was satisfied that it didn't totally suck.I knew it was going to be a bit of a contemporary spin on DB, like the lack of animals and Goku's being more of a typical person and I was cool with that.Well cast movie, Chow Yun-Fat as Roshi and especially the actor playing Yamcha we're very close to character. A lot of the elements of DB are retained in some way, the humour, Roshi's less than chivalrous moments and the somewhat corny yet essential dialogue so those are pluses.Effects were decent, fight scenes were solid and it could have been a lot worse. Took me a few minutes to settle in and not look at it too objectively. If that was the first I've heard of DB it would have been fine but it's not a sterling representation of Dragonball on the whole.",Negative
1060,Totally enjoyed the movie. Acting is good as well as the story line.,Negative
1061,"Dragonball Evolution was a movie I hated when I went to go see it in theaters, but I was 8 years old when I watched it. I just recently saw the movie and my opinions about the movie somewhat changed. The fight scenes are silly some of the time, yet entertaining. The acting is tolerable and the special effects are okay. James Wan gave us a HORRIBLE adaptation to the manga, if not the anime. I felt that if someone who actually watched the damn anime or bothered to do the movie justice at all would direct this movie a whole lot better. However, this movie holds a place in my heart like The Last Airbender did, and I'll always enjoy it.",Negative
1062,"Let's just get it out of the way: this movie isn't really Dragon Ball. If you come into it with preconceptions of what Dragon Ball is and should be, you're obviously bound to be disappointed since Goku and co. Are nothing like their manga/anime progenitors. At several points, just as I was beginning to enjoy it as a camp fest, I'd cringe a bit when hearing names such as Goku and Bulma which reminded me of DB and how disrespectful this movie is of it. But I managed to get over it after the first 30 minutes or so and actually had fun. If it didn't have to live up to its name, the movie definitely wouldn't be highly regarded, but I don't think it would be bottom 14 on IMDb either.I'd say it's alright as a standalone turn-off-your-brain B-movie. Nothing special or memorable, just middle of the road in most respects and below that in some. A lot of reviewers put the effects down, but I'd say that considering the low budget, they're surprisingly good overall. Of course, they ain't Marvel level, but most of them are pretty convincing by 2009 standards and some even rise above B-movie status... Except for the ones in the final 15 minutes or so. The Oozaru and Shenlong are utterly laughable! I guess the budget was running out when they got to that part.The acting is decent overall and has some highlights such as Chow Yun-Fat as Roshi and Joon Park as Yamcha, both of whom are clearly enjoying camping it up. Speaking of camp, that's what this movie should be taken as. The bizarre hodgepodge of cliches from superhero movies, teen dramas/comedies, sci-fi, martial arts and mysticism can be nothing else.If you manage to disassociate it from the Dragon Ball franchise and simply view it as a campy B-movie, you might just enjoy yourself!",Negative
1063,"My expectations for this live-action retelling of the one of anime's/manga's most beloved stories were generally mixxed going into the theater.Bad: Son Goku played by an actor of non-Asian descent and without a martial arts background (as far as I could tell); reports that they wanted this film to be more ""realisitc"" as apposed to the mystical-fantasy realm of the original; and the massive amounts of bad reviews and predictions from critics didn't help either.Good: Produced by Stephen Chow (the writer/director/star of SHAOLIN SOCCER and KUNG FU HUSTLE, classics); directed by James Wong (who gave us the action packed JET LI'S THE ONE); and Chow Yun-Fat starring as Master Roshi (a bit young but hey, it's Chow Yun-Fat!).With these ""good"" points, I figured that even if this was a bad film (which most martial arts films are) it would still be enjoyable and relatively faithful to the spirit of the original. What I saw, however, was a film that tried to live up to the original but falling way short of the mark and flat on its face. Not that it wasn't enjoyable, it was...it was that it wasn't Dragonball.I biggest complaint leaving the theater was that the film felt way too short. I know the director wanted to keep the character's to a minimum to build on characterization, but even with the characters present the story felt rushed with little time to truly enjoy them. The action also felt rushed, especially the final battle between Goku and Piccolo, deminishing the one thing that everyone loves about Dragonball: epic martial art battles. The attempt to make the story more ""realistic"" was more detrimental than anything else in this film.5 out of 10 for even attempting to make a live action film out of a story that spans hundreds of anime episodes and manga volumes into the length of an hour and a half. Still an interesting ""retelling"" despite its downfalls. Enjoyable but don't expect anything great.",Negative
1064,"Hopefully the film company reads this!!! I agree with most of the reviews out there about this movie. I would have thought the companies responsible for making this movie would have done SOME research on the movie,or at least taken some polls/surveys from people who have seen the show. I think there was/still is huge potential for this movie...assuming they get away from the people who made this movie...like so many people have said follow more of the show. Just because some people would like to see changes like this on the screen does not mean the large majority of DB fans wanted such drastic changes in the characters. To me it seemed what they did was take a tiny part of the show and just made stuff up on the fly. Get back to how the show went. If the company does not know where to begin....start with season 1 of dragon ball z. I am guessing this was there attempt at the goku saga?(maybe) I mean come on even something as simple as bulmas hair..streaks of blue..what couldn't the company afford a bottle of blue hair dye? Like I said great potential for this movie...just don't try another one like this.",Negative
1065,"Before even reading this review, you knew that the film was going to fail. You knew that there was no way that a modernized version of a brilliant anime that didn't even have the entire cast of characters (in the first episodes that is) was going to disappoint and deliver garbage. However, the difference between this remake/re-imagining of the animated cartoon and the typical Hollywood remake is the amount of effort. This was not some half-arsed production or cheap attempt to sell more toys and make quick money. This was an actual futile attempt to create a new storyline for the franchise that has been around since the 80s and jump-started the anime craze that eventually hit the United States in the late 90s. But yes the movie is bad. Yes the movie is muddled with clichés, over-blown special effects, wooden writing, and a weak ending. Yet, the energy and flair throughout the production stood out, and the potential for an evolving franchise that jumps from miserably bad to good is there. There is some bit of hope; you just have to deal with the fact that they aren't going to follow the original storyline at all. Maybe it's the fanboyism talking that if they listen; they can deliver a superior work of Dragonball. That or I might be utterly crazy. In the meantime, we shall gripe. 1) Oolong, Vegeta, Turtle, Ox King, Puar, Krillin are not in the film 2) There are no extremely lengthy fights like in the television show 3) Bulma is a gun-wielding feminine cowgal 4) Yamcha has blonde hair 5) Master Roshi was not living in a very secluded island with a palm tree next to it 6) There is only one signature move mentioned in the film 7) Piccolo wasn't green 8) The Great Ape is reduced to angry Donkey KongIf you are not at all ruffled at the previous complaints, then you aren't a fanboy, and can continue reading this so you know why the film fails. If you did get upset, stop reading, because odds are you are already protesting. Dragonball Evolution is most certainly not going to appeal to any of the true-blue fans of the show; those that saw Goku's travels from child to multiple deaths to wonderful memory. As for those who want to know what Dragonball is all about, skip this as well. If you are willing to accept a new vision of Dragonball, read on. To make the plot synopsis simple: Goku must recover 7 dragonballs in order to prevent Piccolo from creating apocalyptic havoc across the planet. With the help of Bulma, Master Roshi and Yamcha, he sets off to try to rid the world of evil using the dragonballs. This film has all the nods to other ""young lad must rise up to overcome challenges despite incredible odds."" The clichés are fired so often, you can predict the next one. It's pretty clear that the writers knew about the anime and the characters, but didn't study about it deeply at all. Its one thing to know the show, it's another thing to truly know the show. Example: makers of Twilight Zone Tower of Terror saw every Twilight Zone episode 3 times. End result is an attraction that literally looks like a Twilight Zone episode. In the case of Dragonball Evolution, it has the characters, some of the familiar characterizations, but that's about it. Blaming the acting would be wrong, since they provided well with the material they had. Justin Chatwin as Goku is a mixed bag; he can play the role, but doesn't resemble Goku that much. Chi-Chi herself doesn't look like Chi-Chi, but Jamie Chung plays the role with a nice dosage of beauty and feistiness. Same goes with Bulma, portrayed by Emmy Rossum. Last but not least, the best performance comes from Yun-Fat Chow, who plays Master Roshi perfectly. Too bad the turtle sidekick from the cartoon was missing. Bottom Line: Let's just wrap the review simply with this: It sucks, but could have been halfway decent if the clichés weren't flying and there was more research plastered into the production. While a Dragonball movie outside the manga series actually following the franchise plot lines is inevitable (there have been two live-action films already) the effort placed in this installment was actually uplifting, even if the quality of the movie itself destroyed any positive feelings. Dragonball itself is an amazingly charming story full of rich characters, why not do a highly accurate adaptation? The only reason to see this movie is the only reason I went to see it: for nostalgia sakes, to reminisce the good times of Toonami. Don't expect miserable utter failure, but expect a bad movie with a few good moments and elements.",Negative
1066,"After seeing the bootleg and screaming as my eyes burned...I felt that Dragonball was dead. After seeing the bootleg, I felt a little raped as some of you have felt as well.So I decided that I still needed to see the film on the big screen for a couple of reasons. One-felt like I had to since Dragonball was by far my favorite cartoon and had to pay respect to the creator who also was an executive producer of this film. Two-there were some extra minutes in this version than the bootleg...and yes, it's very obvious where the cuts are in the bootleg. It was really bad.So I took my girlfriend who had no idea what Dragonball was about. Before the film started, I gave her a summary of the cartoon so she would at least have some idea of what the film was going to be about. She looked confused about some things, but that is understandable.So when the film started, they gave a brief summary about what happened to Piccolo. There were some things I liked about the intro to the film, but there were some things that I did not like. It seemed a little to short for an intro in my opinion. Seemed like the people that had no idea about dragonball, or the characters, were a little cheated in a way. It was poor character development for Piccolo.It then goes on and we meet Goku as a teenager. Now a lot of people have been complaining about Justin Chatwin (I have been to) and I must say....I take back some of things I have said about the dude. A lot of people wanted an Asian Goku...maybe to show respect...or simply because they thought he was more Asian than white. In my opinion...I don't really care. Some of his facial expressions were great.I'm not going to go through every single scene and break it down...so let's just go to what I didn't like and what I did like.Things I liked: The composed music is amazing. It brings the movie alone up a few ratings. Good job Brian Tyler, you have done it again. The extra minutes in the film made the film better without a doubt compared to the bootleg. There wasn't any hardcore cutting to where you are like ""wait, what just happened?"" A specific scene I am talking to is when the bully runs over Goku bikes. To those who have seen the bootleg and the U.S version, you know what I'm talking about. I thought the special effects were just OK. The big fight scene at the end was actually better to watch in the theatre.Things I didn't like: I understand that the cartoon had a lot of cheesy dialogue, but I feel it didn't work in this film. They tried to go for a more realistic sense and the dialogue just didn't work in a lot of places...especially with Goku at the end. The fighting needed to be better. I think the best fight scene in the entire film had to be at the beginning with Grandpa Gohan and Goku.I think everyone will agree with me on this one...Goku in high school is the main thing I did not like in this film. Goku asking how to get girls? No.....*shakes head*....just no. Why? Why not just have him at his grandpa's house? He didn't need to go to school...he could have just met chi chi...I don't know, I just think that part of the story should have been different.OK...If anyone who wants to see the film...but is just afraid...if you have any questions...go ahead and ask...but i will say this...it's better than the bootleg...So my official review of the film...bootleg version: 3/10 Official Version: 5/10 If there is a sequel...then I will say this...have better choreography fights. And the direction was not as bad as I thought it was going to be...but man oh man...get a better story and a bigger budget for the effects. PLEASE GET A BETTER STORY!! THAT'S ALL I ASK FOR OUT OF ANYTHING!",Negative
1067,"I'm gonna get straight to the point. This movie is stupid, poorly made, and... okay. It sucks.First, the acting is terrible. A line in the film is ""I will avenge him"" and it's painfully hollow. I was expecting them to reveal that everybody was robots at the end. The only good actors in the movie are Yun-Chow-Fat, or however you say his name, and James Marsters. By the way, James Marsters- Piccolo- the villain- with the best dialog in the movie- is barely in the film. I mean it. On that subject, there are so many underdeveloped plots in the film. Especially the love subplots. Apparently, all i need to do to get a girl is open her locker for her. And what was up with Yamcha and Bulma? They immediately hit on each other, even after Yamcha traps them in a hole/cave. Next, the effects. Awful. The Oozaru. I'm shocked that that thing got past the editing room. That and those monsters that piccolo sends after the heroes. Oh, I almost forgot to question why, when these people meet each other- they automatically say ""Oh. I've got to help you."" What the heck is that? On the good side, I enjoyed the last twenty minutes of the movie despite the effects. Like I said, James Marsters and Chow-Yun-Fat are good and Roshi was funny. But, there is just nothing to offer here. The movie's biggest problem is that it's stupid and the jerks at Fox clearly didn't care at all about Dragonball.4/10REBOOT PLEASE",Negative
1068,"It's truly amazing to see everybody obliterating this movie. Some first-timers just registered on IMDb to be able to express their disgust about this film adaptation. Of course, most people who react are die-hard fans of the original manga.Look, when I was a kid, I used to read all those Marvel comics, presuming they would be available in my little village in Belgium. On TV I was addicted to all those manga series on the French channels. I am also a die-hard fan! My closet is filled with both comics and manga series.Here's the thing. Let's take the X-Men, Spiderman, Batman, and God knows what other recent film adaptation, and they're in several cases nowhere near the written holder of the name. Let's get to the manga field, and take Fist of the North Star, with several 'big' names. What was up with the guy playing Kenshiro here? Dragonball Evolution is doing basically the same as movies mentioned above: it takes some elements from the original story, usually elements that cover several years of that story. It tries to make a whole. It fails, as expected (the final fighting scene is indeed terrible), but delivers in some way (the main character had potential).What would be good? Some kid with a tail running around naked, turning into King Kong, fighting childish monsters from the Red Ribbon army? No, you need adolescents, but then you must change the story. The whole idea of the dragon balls has to be introduced, so they integrated it in the change. They try to use the relevant characters from the original: a tech girl, a skilled thief, an old pervert martial arts expert, a dead grandfather, a chick that will hold the love interest of the protagonist, and of course a monster to fight with.No, it's not the same as the manga. No, the actors probably didn't all check out what it's all about, which makes them seem sometimes bad. No, the hardcore fans will never be satisfied. But yes, it's entertaining for a clueless crowd, and it can be entertaining for people who keep an open mind. The movie industry is all about commercialization, not so much about tradition. I would take my kids to see this. I'm happy I saw it. I can see myself watching it again.I'm sorry if many will not agree with this point of view. I didn't expect much, and I got more than I expected. That's a passing grade in my book.",Negative
1069,"So I've heard a lot of bad things about Dragonball Evolution; bad acting, bad visuals, poor writing, etc. However, after seeing it I'm sorely disappointed in the Dragon Ball fanbase for being as closed-minded and dismissive of an excellent movie.As far as reviews on this particular title go, there were a LOT before the movie even hit the theaters, making me question the legitimacy of the sources. Either they were pirated, or a LOT of insiders decided to review express copies. The second doesn't seem very likely. Having seen the special effects myself, they look great - on the big screen. The ki attacks looked natural and fluid rather than over-dramatic and lightning-y. The acting wasn't nearly as bad as what I was told either, considering the characters that are being portrayed. In the end, it seems to me it was a load of internet junkies jumping the gun on what might not have even been a final production copy.Many say the story seemed rushed. It may have been somewhat, but more so to convey story than action. It was more cohesive to a long-time fan than a new-comer, but the point remains. Story and comedy have always been #1 for Dragon Ball, with a close second to action, and that seems to have been forgotten. Adaptations can't always have all of the original elements, as it doesn't work in one media as another. If you don't believe me, look at Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins.There is also a notion from many fans of anime that American adaptations are inherently worse. Emotions aren't conveyed as well, action scenes aren't as entertaining or believable, and aren't written as well. The main opinion is that the Japanese are just a master race when it comes to acting and writing, and this usually comes from whiny American kids who don't actually know anything about Japan. To those people I say: READ THE CREDITS. Akira Toriyama, creator and writer of the original Dragon Ball, is the Executive Producer.In the end, it just seems like it was never really given a fair chance. Nor was it seen as it was meant to be - in a theater. So if you aren't just going to automatically say it was terrible because you have a preconceived opinion from leaked footage, it's worth a look.",Negative
1070,".... Not to get in to too much about what's wrong with this movie, but one major question i haven't seen addressed is where the hell is krillin?? He was almost the comic relief for the cartoon. He was not the most important character, but didn't he grow up with Goku? I may be wrong thinking he should be in the movie, but he trained with Goku and Master Roshi.. If anyone could shed light on that it would be much appreciated... And it appears that the director tried to make so much of an Americanized version of this film that he did an almost twilight type dragon ball, which does not belong anywhere in this movie. It was a great cartoon, and even better manga. I have not seen the movie yet, but i will go see it, even if just for reminiscent purposes, I just hope I am not let down. Again please someone tell where Krillin, the bald little guy with the disc, is at?",Negative
1071,"I expected a pretty bad movie considering all the comments I had heard about the film. I finally saw it today and I had a good time. I laughed a lot and the movie is not that bad. I was a bit disappointed when I saw the special effects....I have to say I expected a lot more. The acting was decent. Nothing out of the ordinary and the plot was OK, although it's kind of lazy sometimes. If there's a sequel they should try with a new director. Of course the cartoon is a lot better so if you're hoping to see a faithful adaptation of the cartoon into the big screen, then you'll be very disappointed. Dragonball has a lot of potential, they could really do Great movies with the story lines from the cartoon...just try a little harder!",Negative
1072,"This film is about a modern day American teenager who was chosen to find the seven dragon balls lost somewhere in America.""Dragonball Evolution"" is getting scathing word of mouth even before it was released, and I can see why. I don't understand why the chosen guy is American, and the dragon balls are in America. The race to find the dragon balls is hardly exciting or adventurous either.However, putting aside the drastic differences compared to the original comic, ""Dragonball Evolution"" is quite enjoyable. It has great special effects, believable romance and good looking leads. Together with the cheesy plot, it is good for brain off popcorn entertainment.",Negative
1073,Give dragonball evolution a chance rather screwing its name and making fun of it...i think the movies gonna be good...dragonball has been the favorite of many people in the world and the people want to give rise to the new dragonball evolution movie thats kool..so instead of making fun see the movie and then decide don't screw the image of dragonball evolution.....iv seen the movie trailer and it looks amazing...the special effect taken are also pretty good..so i don't understandwhy people are making fun of it....its gonna rule............ ................ .......................... ............. ........... ............ ..........acash,Negative
1074,"Mankind's worst attempt of trying to use camera's. The scenario is far worse than a day of me in the toilet. The man who made this masterpiece of garbage is clearly between 2 and at most 3 years old. Please someone on IMDb make an exception and rate it 0 or below if possible (NOT). Even if you don't consider the adaptation from Dragonball, which this is not the case, this is still one of the vomitory movies anyone could watch.Lumiere are rolling in there graves.P.S to MR wong, rename yourself to Wrong and do not attempt to touch any other anime ever again. Ever, Never.",Negative
1075,"This franchise has so much potential in the live-action scene. In Dragonball Evolution, Goku is 18 and a high school/college student. This movie is mostly the Roshi training/King Piccolo arcs mashed together, which is fine, the whole of Dragonball condensed into one movie. The pacing through the series was great and really the only thing good about this movie. Seeing as they had these two arcs, and Goku was 15 when he fought Piccolo, why didn't they just set Goku at 15? It would be an acceptable change, would it not? And why did they put him in school? To make him seem normal? There's the thing, Goku is anything BUT normal and never had a day of formal education in his life. THAT, was some bullshit. Also, where was Krillin? Krillin was a major character in the series.Had it not been based on Dragonball, it would be a mediocre movie. But it ruined one of the most well-loved franchises in history, and that makes it one of the worst movies of all time.",Negative
1076,"If you've ever wondered what would happen if you took a beloved, high-energy anime and stripped away everything that made it iconic, Dragon Ball Evolution has your answer. The film feels less like an adaptation and more like a rough draft of a generic teen action movie that someone vaguely themed around Dragon Ball at the last minute.The characters barely resemble their originals: Goku is reduced to an awkward high-schooler, Piccolo looks like he escaped from a Halloween store clearance bin, and the script seems determined to avoid anything that might actually excite longtime fans. The fight scenes are bland, the CGI already looked dated when the movie released, and the tone wobbles between unintentional comedy and outright confusion.It purely earns its place as one of the worst adaptations of an anime because it is technically a movie with a beginning, middle, and end. But as a Dragon Ball adaptation? It's a catastrophe of missed potential, questionable choices, and outright misunderstandings of what made the franchise special.",Negative

1078,"One of the worst movies ever made and a disgrace to the Dragon Ball z 
I just have nothing to say about it",Negative
1079,"Let me start out by saying that I may be one of the biggest Dragonball/Dragonball Z fans of all time. I can remember getting off the bus every day and excitedly waiting for the next episode of Dragonball.Whenever I wasn't watching the series, I was buying up the newest movies, collecting dozens and dozens of action figures, playing that stupid card game, drawing pictures, and absorbing as much ""Dragonball Knowledge"" as I possibly could.Dragonball is, in my opinion, the greatest animated work ever. It is a fantastic cartoon series that is so gripping and intense that I enjoy watching it to this day.With that being said, you can imagine my excitement when I first read in a Beckett Dragonball Z magazine that Fox had acquired the rights to make a live action Dragonball Z movie. Fast forward five or so years later, and we have Dragonball Evolution. The film I had been waiting for since adolescence.I was skeptical, of course, how could they possibly transition my childhood icons to the big screen? How could they script such a rich and interesting story? But, I assured myself they couldn't screw it up too bad.Then I saw the trailer.As I watched the last remnants of my childhood die, I completely dropped all standards for this movie and simply saw it for fun.If you go into this film expecting Dragonball, you will be sorely disappointed.It is a sad parody of Akira Toriyama's epic. There are literally innumerable inconsistencies with Dragonball Evolution and the Dragonball series. Goku has no tail? Piccolo has some estranged unexplained female lackey? Goku went to high school? Seven mystics made the Dragonballs? I could go on and on.But, if you go expecting a good time, you will have one. Although the story is so thin it's almost absent, I loved every second of its wacky charm. This film felt like a high budget ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch with all its clichés and absurdities making it downright hilarious. I often found myself uncontrollably laughing.It is literally the funniest films I have seen in quite a long time, and with society's current state laughter is becoming rare. So I accept it, even though the ending makes no sense, the characters are as thick as blocks, and the writing is cringe-worthy.And for those of you with kids, they'll love it. It's brainless action with quirky characters, explosions, and kung-fu. Although be warned, some of the women's shirt cut-lines are *ahem* less than conservative, but no nudity is visible.Don't expect this to be Dragonball Z or even Dragonball, it's not. It's no where near such levels of excellence. But that's okay.I had a genuinely good time viewing this mediocre work of art, and I will probably watch it again in the future. I honestly adore this awful movie and its poor attempt to recreate my favorite childhood show.And if you go into it with an upbeat attitude, you will too.6.5/10",Negative
1080,"Well, if there were two movies I was worried about as far as ruining my childhood, it would be ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" and this bad boy, which, while it's much, MUCH better than the aforementioned abomination, is still pretty tough to watch in a serious way, as it's barely passable as unintentional camp fun. I don't even know if that's a compliment or not.I can honestly say that I wasn't disappointed by this 'film', but I can't decide if it's because my expectations were so low, or because I actually liked the campy feel of it, versus the ""Street Fighter"" blowup that tried WAY too hard to be serious. Thankfully, there at least appears to be some effort put into this one, as the special effects aren't laughably bad (nor are they good, especially the creature effects *gags*), and the characters are as endearing as they are cheesy.Justin Chatwin is probably one of my least favorite actors, and I found his Goku to be rather bland with only flashes of the geeky hero he really is. Chatwin plays the role by the book, never letting go of the script pages enough to make the character his own. Emmy Rossum gives the cheesiest performance in the film after Chow Yun Fat (though he was supposed to be like that), and it's kind of stunning considering the wonderful talent this young actress possesses. James Marsters is stereotypically bad as Piccolo, who is so absent from the film that it's kind of sad. I don't blame Marsters for the failure of Piccolo, however, as he is horribly written.The film features numerous special effects, but doesn't overdo it, as they aren't that great. It wasn't a distraction or anything though, so it doesn't get any points off here. The film also has a very rushed, compact, and empty finale. Another point I want to make is that there weren't really any scenes that stood out to me besides the Goku/Chi Chi scenes (which were actually kind of sad, because Jamie Chung was trying so hard to make them work, and Justin Chatwin just...wasn't).""Dragonball Evolution"" definitely falls into the category I made for the ""Twilight"" film: so bad, it's almost good. It's decent campy fun that retains a little bit of the spirit of the television show in the transition to modern times (though not enough to make a big impact), and I didn't feel like I wasted my time. However, I'd go ahead and wait for the DVD or catch it online. I'm not upset because I didn't have to pay...Oh the joys of working at a movie theater...",Negative
1081,"I really don't see the movie deserving even the 1 star out of 10..It has molested the image of Dragonball Z/GT , which has been the hard work of anime-makers in Japan over so many years..They just destroyed the epic. The film-makers should go to jail for this. If there is a petition for blacklisting the film-makers from doing any more irreparable damage , i will be more than happy to sign it.The image i had in mind for Goku was destroyed and things keep happening on their own. Crappy directing/production. It's the perfect example of how you can destroy an empire by just shunning its king with some sort of rape charges.Watching the whole movie was too big a deal for me , but i ""endured"" ..yes , endured the whole movie just to see how bad it could get. And believe me it was much worse than i had anticipated. If you consider yourself a DragonBall fan , DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE! I absolutely Taboo anyone from watching it!",Negative
1082,"This really is as bad as everyone says it is. The story is awful, the characters have no development, the effects are shoddy, and the action is boring, and that's all without mentioning the acting.There's really nothing to redeem it, but even that doesn't get across just how bad this is. If you watch it, your face will be stuck scrunched up in pain and disgust for the entire running time.",Negative
1083,"Oh boy, Dragon Ball Evolution.... Now I have been a fan ever since I was little. I've watched every single episode at least 3 times and I have to say that this was like taking those memories and dumping a pile of dung on them. Now, I can normally handle a terrible movie but this? This was a disgrace in every regard. It had no similarities with the series, the actors were awful in every way! And the scripting was enough to blow a persons brains out. Alright calm down, let me say the specifics of this movie that make me want to gouge my eyes out. Goku. The actor not only didn't sound or look anywhere near him (and yes I know that Goku's a animated character but still!)! Second of all, he's in high school... HE'S IN BLOODY HIGH SCHOOL! Fans of the series will know how dumb that is. Bulma... No blue hair = NO BULMA! Great Ape Goku? This is enough to kill me. Great apes are supposed to be absolutely huge! As big as a skyscraper! Their Goku was hardly grew a foot! Now don't get me started on King Piccolo! Absolute worst of them all! By acting and by appearance he was a disgrace. Phew. That's enough. I could go on but I might put my head through a wall...",Negative

1085,How do you take one of the most loved shows ever and utterly botch a live action adaptation so poorly. I don't trust anyone that have this over 1 Star.,Negative
1086,What a steaming hot pile of garbage this was. I feel so bad for the actors whose reputation was tarnished. To the actors who watched and read the source material to understand the role only to be shown the garbage script. The director should be sued and made to pay the actors who lost roles and money because of this inability to do anything. Just make a movie without dragging a anime by using its name and characters. Do not watch this as you'll waste valuable minutes of your life.,Negative

1088,"When I first heard about this movie I was very skeptical about how it would turn out. I am a big fan of the original dragonball cartoon series and I didn't think for a second that the movie would be as good.When I first saw the movie, I almost cried. I didn't expect it to be great but I was not prepared for the crapfest that it was. The acting was average and the special effects were OK (not great, but OK). My main problem was the story. I won't include any spoilers but I will say that there was no need for them to change so many things.To sum up, a classic and brilliant story was taken and absolutely butchered. If your a fan of the original series then please stay well away from this movie as you will just be disappointed like I was. I just pray that the sequel gets cancelled.",Negative
1089,"There's no way this director ever watched an episode of this cartoon. The actors were awful choices for the characters they played. Apparently Piccolo has the same powers as Darth Vader (Force Grip) Yamcha was pretty cool in the cartoon, this guy is possibly the biggest tool I have ever seen in my life! There is no possible way to make this movie any worse. I don't know whats more embarrassing, having a part in the creation of this movie or the fact that i have spent an hour and a half watching the whole thing. I kept watching in hopes of something happening to redeem it slightly but nothing happened. Hands down the worst interpretation imaginable of something great.",Negative
1090,"What a joke Please make a new Dragonball Movie with some better characterizations and do it right...Start from Dragon Ball Z if u wish, as it's the better, and if u succeed u can go back to dragonball (past) or dragon ball gt (future)But u must pick at first the better one, like LUCAS did with STAR WARS...So the first movies should have been:First Saga: Vegeta; Second Saga: Freezer ; Third Saga: Cyborgs ;Fourth Saga: CELL; FIFTH SAGA: BOOO BOOOAnd please choose some better actors... Master roshi is bald u bastards.... Bulma has blue hair etc etc etcThis director should be banned from directing more movies or at least should have been some organization that protect some stories from being told by incompetent people",Negative
1091,"the director's job was easy compared to mine. All he had to do was make a good movie on a television show that was story that already existed in the television show. My job is to describe how terrible this movie is in 1000 words or less. To start how does Goku a man child in the television show who only cared about fighting, family, food, and fun turn into a whiny little emo punk? Piccilo not a bad casting choice should have gone with someone taller thats all. The Oozaru is a 50ft tall ape creature in the television series in the movie, its a werewolf dude like really.... I'm not even gonna put the rest of what is wrong with this movie into sentences to save time this is the last introduction you are getting: Master Roshi is a hermit he doesn't live in the city Goku meets Roshi when hes like 6 Bulma is supposed to be like 10 years older than Goku Goku never went to school Its pronounced Namek not Nemix Goku needs a tail or he can't change Piccilo is supposed to be an evil alien martial artist not a god damned sith lord Shenron is supposed to be huge not like 10ft Where is krillin... alright to conclude you took all the fun out of the series. And its going to be very hard for someone who actually understands the source material to gt the rights to make a good movie because this sh*t box film exists. Why god did you let this happen.",Negative
1092,Im sorry. But it's Dragonball Z. Never was a fan as a kid. And definitely not now. The movie shows it for what it is. Haters going to hate. Therefore its a solid 10. Perfect adaptation. Hahaha,Negative
1093,"I have mix feeling about the movie. I went to the theater very open minded, and it worked. I mean, I actually enjoy most of the movie taking into account that this is not Dragonball Z but an adaptation to Dragonball, which turns to be more for small kids than grown ups. However I must say I was VERY disappointed with the final battle and specially with the Kame-Hame Ha. It wasn't exiting at all, instead was a very rushed ending and many loose endings (that will work like a charm if they make a good sequel).Justin Chatwin makes a funny Goku, which works for Dragonball (Evolution), however he will have to train REALLY hard as the sequels go by because his character grows up both body and mind while time goes by, so I hope he will be up to the task for the future. Mr. Chatwin, so far so good.I was kind of bumped about the fact that Piccolo is a very small part of the movie and that he don't really shows us the real menace he is. Instead his appearance is just for a few minutes and a very green Goku is able to defeat him without problems. Piccolo is a bad-ass, c'mon!!!!. You failed on this one. Not your fault though, Mr. Masters.The rest of the characters were OK. Bulma, Yamtcha and Roshi did a nice job working together.We really needed to see more intense training for Goku in the future films than the really lame air bending training that is showed on Evolution. We need to believe this youngster is going to defend us from Vegeta and the Sayians, so GET TO WORK, SCREEWRITERS!.By saying that I will give 6.5/10 points given the effort and the relative small budget (50 million) they had to spend.To the hardcore fans: The movie is appointed for little kids, so try not to fill the air with negative energy. It's OK for starters. I'm agree on something though: GO HOME JAMES WONG!!!!. This type of franchise (and specially for the story to come) needs a director with (dragon)balls. The Wachovsky maybe?. You decide.",Negative
1094,"Oh yes, I remember this highly anticipated film. Everyone was impatiently waiting for this, especially Dragonball fans. When it came out and when I looked at it, the disappointment I felt was something indescribable. Acting at the amateur level tis very below average. All characters are generic without personality without enthusiasm. Visible attempts to insert some funny scenes that are not funny at all, forced commedy. A romantic relationship, if we can call it that, was inserted purely to exist in the story. The plot is characterless, uninterestingly complicated and moves too quickly without explanation every now and then, lots of unexplained things, sketchy with lots of holes in the story. The only good thing in this movie is the visual effects, I must to admit, but that's not nearly enough to save the rest of the film.",Negative
1095,"Regrettable attempt to achieve an adaptation according to the tastes of North Americans
Lacking the soul and charisma that characterized the anime; nobody within the production seems to have seen any chapter and it shows that they tried to turn the characters into superheroes of the time.They destroy the characters, add a non-existent love arc in the anime and the action far from what it should be, understanding that the effects to achieve it would be very expensive but at least they could have been more ingenious.I give it one star because at least, and that's being very kind, the main character's wardrobe (at the end of the film) shows a certain resemblance to the anime and I liked the effect of the dragon balls. And that they filmed it in Mexico, that's all I highlight about this film.",Negative
1096,"OK the concept of the Idea was good I see the director is very good the storyline could have been good however why was this picture squezed it could have been great if the movie took time to look at some aspects deeply (also Goku wished Back Master Roshi but he knew he could also wish back his grandfather ?? no moral dilemma ""granpa ill do that next time sorry"" thats the least he could say and yes the deadth scene ? reminded me of the Batman of The Future WTF was it necessary even for him to die ???Goku for the first time went to a party and Picollo just had to attack now XD:)...I laughed really) To much characters kicked out the main Antagonist wonderful its the first movie I seen when the Antagonist was how do you put it not present (guys it actually only worked for the Lord of The Rings) Picollo had the right for some screen time most viewers expect to know something about the bad guy yes we want to see him listen to him understand his chain of thoughts come on people don't get bad ass just like that ! There's no such thing as absolutely good person and absolutely evil person the battle of the characters is the aspects of to conflicting truths the good guy dosen't only kill the bad guy he should lecture the bad guy where that bad guy made his errors thats what most of the heroes do not only in anime look at Dark Knight !!!

I admit to being a fan of the cartoon and I've seen every episode but I was looking forward to this film in full knowledge it would not be the same. I have to say as a stand alone film it looked like they were just going through the motions. The dialogue was childish and the story had been squished into such a short space. No time at all had been taken to write a proper story - they just bastardised the original, Goku was a white teenage boy for Christ sake!they should have written a new story that just paid homage to the original coming up with something interesting but instead they ruined an already well developed story. i think they just made some cheap rubbish to see if they could get all the dragon ball fans to rent it!",Negative

1100,"I watched it as I enjoy the dragon ball cartoons and comics and thought it might be interesting, despite a lot of negative reviews etc but lets look at it for what it is. No its not going to light the acedamy on fire and it is not going to go down in history for deep plot and script writing. The movie is fun and when you think of the challenge of bringing manga comics/animation to live action thats a big task. I thought the realisation of the characters was good and the elements they have taken made for good story telling. There is life in the movie and the enevitable sequels can get better. I will most likely buy on release as it is something fun to watch on a slow weekend afternoon. If you want a martial arts epic watch Legend, Enter The Dragon or Hero, if you just want to sit back and be entertained this is not a bad choice.",Negative
1101,"The thing that pisses me off is not the fact the the movie itself sucks. I mean, seriously. You could not have possibly expected otherwise. The thing that pisses me off the most is the fact that a person like me will spend weeks/months pouring his/her soul into a script, only to send it to Hollywood and have it thrown into the very pile of ""junk"" that should have been the final resting place for this flaming pile of human feces. Not saying that my work is the best out there. But I do know 2 things: 1. a film made from one of my screenplays would not exclusively have negative reviews on IMDb.com (EVEN if it were an adaptation); 2. my screenplay would not insult an entire nation of people, not to mention millions of others in other nations. I'm sure the same thing goes for most other aspiring writers out there.EVERYONE who was involved in the making of this ""film"" should really look back on it as the low point of his/her career, and use it as an example of what NOT to do. Can't possibly find a better example than this one.",Negative

She's also the only one that seems to have paid attention in acting school because the Goku character made me cringe 2minutes in with the horrific showcase.Don't watch this, watch a couple Anime episodes instead or look up the girl that played Bulma and watch one of her movies. I'll guarantee you that either will enjoy you more.",Negative
1104,"When the first notice was heard that a movie was going to be made based on the DragonBall franchise, everybody started saying things like their childhood was going to be destroyed, that there couldn't be a good movie based on it, that oh my god Gokuh is not Asian, etc. And when the first images and info were leaked, people just couldn't believe their eyes, that Gokuh was on High School when he was supposed to be a child, that he has no tail, that casting was plain wrong, and that Gokuh's hair was a failure if compared to the manga/anime's, therefore movie was faeces.Seriously, how can ANYBODY dare post a comment like that based on the hair of character of a movie that has no had any kind of official nothing released? (If you don't know what I am talking about, I am talking about the picture of Gokuh with a backpack in a parking lot, the first image leaked)I am saying this because I have read MANY comments like this, and I don't mean written by any stupid basement dweller blogging around, I have read these on truthful, reliable movie blogs (spanish blogs, I have to say), sources of information that are not supposed to take a side on anything, just inform with a little degree of subjectivity.And yet, people do not stop bashing their heads on the keyboard and see that the original DB manga/anime was not that good. We deem it good because we saw it through a child's eyes, we saw people flying around, shouting, throwing energy balls with their bare hands, GOD (which was a green alien) and those things that fit so well in the real world we live in.Anyway, there cannot be such a thing as a faithful DB movie. The original manga tells the story of an alien kid with a tail that becomes a huge monkey when full moon shines,rides a cloud and waves a stick that can become longer or shorter at command, is taught martial arts by an old man, has a friend with no nose, a friend who is afraid of women, a flying blue shape-shifting ¿cat?, a talking pig, and has to find 7 dragon balls to summon a dragon that will grant him one wish. I have to remind you geeks around the world who hate this movie, that the talking pig asks the dragon for some knickers, and oh my,the dragon gives him those knickers.Now imagine this on a cinema screen with real people. OH MY GOD it cannot be made, leave my childhood alone. Cluck you. Cinema is a business that can and does earn MILLIONS of dollars basing the scripts of their movies on things that already exist, whether these things are anime, manga, TV series, books, short stories, other movies. So if there can be a DB movie, there will be a DB movie.They had to change things from the original, of course they had, everything would have looked plain stupid otherwise.Gokuh is on HighSchool as his son was in high school in DBZ (right before the BuBu saga). And he is older because if you don't have a GOOD script(and I am thinking about AI, by Steven Spielberg) and the main character is a kid, your movie will be FOR kids. Who the cluck wants to see a kid doing stuff anyway?I have seen all the videos that there are around on the internet, and of course, people complain about action and humor and acting and everything, without regarding the original source, which was and is full of slapstick humor, and they complain about this very fact, arguing that if they change something, they should change it for good, this is, if they try to give it a more familiar and ""adult"" look, they should completely reject humor parts.I will make a FULL review WHEN I SEE THE MOVIE, I don't have my expectations high because I know EXACTLY what I am going to see, that is, a good dose of action, kicks, energy balls and entertainment. Yes, entertainment. Because entertainment is what the movies are for.And to finish, I have to say I grew up watching Dragon Ball and DBZ, and I was a really big fan, but hey, I grew out of it. I didn't like at all the first DB, I preferred DBZ much much better. And for those people that say that the final confrontation in the movie should be like the one between Neo and Agent Smith on MAtrix Revolutions...I simply have to say that in the Manga Gokuh cannot fly YET, mostly because he has not trained enough (why would he move around on a cloud if he could fly?). And I don't think that in the introduction movie of a saga (oh yes, I do hope they do more, usually sequels of ""hero"" movies are better than the first installments, suck on that) the main character will learn how to pull Kame Hame's, fly and fight, since all these three things are supposed to take a little training.",Negative

And I am a positive guy. :(",Negative
1106,"First of all before u continue to making comments about this movie ask your self why u even watched it, you all might have seen the previews to it that tells you mostly if a movie will s@$k or not. Every one should know by now all movies based on games and anime and comics will all ways be wrong when they make a movie. Example Wolverine Origins - in the previews with out watching the movie, gambit should be younger then cyclops and cyclops should not even be born when wolverine got the metal skeleton. The reason why wolverine got it was so he can hunt down the hulk read the comic not the new one that was created for the film the original one wolverine first came out in marvel in a hulk comic. This is knowledge not a spoiler watch the movie to see what i mean. Look first of all if you wanted to see Super Saiyans and other things from dragon ball z then don't watch. Its not dragon ball Z!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its Dragon ball!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! second of all from what i saw the story was off by a lot but was close, i wont spoil it for those that are true dragon ball fans know what i mean. The characters were OK the way the pro trade them was OK by major dragon ball fan standers.A major point is that Goku is an alien so if in any way he pro trade in a live action movie he can be any color race, but the movie makers decide to keep it like the manga and anime the race color white so no complaining why a British dude played him. This movie was suppose to be if it were real and there are a lot of details that they could not film like a little kid beating up adults and the training he went through, its to long and none realistic but they tried they messed up just even trying but they at least came up with something. The budget has nothing to do with it, It always ends with the writers. If you know what they wrote before they came to you and asked can we have money so we can make it of course people wont give any. But fans want it you get what you want, but its to late to complain. Remember Fox movies s$%k they ruin suppose to be good movies.",Negative
1107,"Without a doubt one of, if not the worst movie I have ever seen. Whoever made this should be ashamed. Please do yourself a favour and never watch this ever. Don't even mention it. It doesn't deserve that. The acting is so bad, its not even funny. The characters are so far away from the original you would have trouble thinking this is even dragon ball. The plot. Oh the plot. Well it doesn't make sense at all. There is nothing from the anime or the manga that resembles this. The dragonballs were created by 7 mystics? Um no. Goku goes to school? No. Goku fights piccolo as a teenager? Not the first time. Goku is in love with chichi? He didn't even know about girls until after his gramps died of natural causes. There is just too much wrong with this movie. I don't usually review movies but this was just so unbelievably bad I had to vent.",Negative
1108,"We knew it before it even came out. That it wasn't going to be the same as the original series. It couldn't be. The story would be changed to fit into 2 hours available and so some things would have to go and plots would have to be simplified. This movie does suck on every level but if it would have been only a matter of poor overall quality then it wouldn't have been a big deal. Hate it and move on!I feel though the makers didn't stop just there. They betrayed the whole spirit of the Dragonball saga. Goku's key characteristics aren't his strength, hair or lineage as much as his personality. A sweet, confident, feisty boy who is unshakable in the clarity and simplicity of his convictions. A little wild man who's free from the pressures to fit in. This movie's Goku is NOTHING like the Goku we all know and love. He is the same archetype used in all fantasy movies involving an adolescent. Being special but for some reason hating it just wanting to fit in, blah blah blah. Goku's personality is THE most important part in Dragonball and the makers just threw it all away. They could've had a unique character for a change but instead they settled for mediocre. Maybe it's a good thing that the screw up was utterly so, so that when somebody with the stones to do this properly finally comes along it can be fresh fresh for western viewers",Negative
1109,"Some of the most talented actors are supporting roles in this film. I met Mr. Blake in Japan at the premiere of this film and have followed his career ever since! Also, Justin Chatwin is the most perfectly cast Goku there could be. This story simply could've been better.",Negative
1110,"Dragonball Evolution attempts to bring the cartoony and over-the-top martial arts/fantasy/sci-fi manga to the big screen. Mostly the transition has been handled well. The film takes considerable liberties with the source material but considering the over-all length of the original manga this is to be expected and the changes work on their own.Characters are given adequate introductions and the film also features plenty of comedy to even out the fighting and action. However, the film suffers from scenes rushing by way too quickly and the villains for one are not given many character moments. It really feels like the film makers could have taken the time and textured the film's plot better before the inevitable CG-heavy final fight sequence which was thankfully handled very well.Despite some rather sharp contrasts with the original characters' appearances all the actors seem to fit their roles well, especially Justin Chatwin who is finally allowed to channel the bad ass towards the end of the film. The only character whose transition wasn't perhaps done as well as I hoped was Shen Long who pops up only near the very end.Between the comedy and action, the inherent entertainment value of the piece Dragonball Evolution is well done adaptation of the world famous manga. If the sequel ever materializes I hope they take time to work on the film's pacing rather than just slapping on some more characters from the manga.",Negative
1111,"Dragonball Evolution is not merely a failure-it is a cinematic abomination. It stands as a textbook example of what happens when a studio acquires the rights to a beloved franchise and hands it over to creators who do not understand, respect, or even remotely care about the source material.This film is not a reinterpretation. It's not even a loose adaptation. It is a soulless, tone-deaf cash grab that uses the name ""Dragon Ball"" purely for branding, while stripping away every single element that made the original story meaningful, fun, and iconic.Goku-who should embody curiosity, kindness, and boundless fighting spirit-is turned into a whiny, awkward, high-school kid straight out of an early 2000s teen drama. Piccolo is reduced to a bland villain with zero depth. The character arcs are nonexistent. Dialogue is cringe-inducing, often bordering on parody, and the lore is butchered beyond recognition. Ki becomes a generic magic trick, the Dragon Balls are a cheap plot device, and fan-favorite moments are either ignored or reimagined in ways that make absolutely no sense.The action choreography is uninspired, sluggish, and poorly edited. The visual effects look dated even for the time of release. There's no spectacle, no sense of scale or tension-just flashes of light and embarrassing wire-fu. Worse, the film fails even on the most basic cinematic levels: poor pacing, amateur direction, wooden acting, and a script that feels like it was written in one afternoon.Dragonball Evolution isn't so-bad-it's-good. It's just so-bad-it's-painful. Fans of the franchise will find nothing of value here, and newcomers will walk away wondering why Dragon Ball is even popular in the first place. It's the kind of movie that should be shown in film schools-not as inspiration, but as a warning.",Negative
1112,"This is the No. 1 Movie from the bottom. Meaning it's the worst movie, ever.I thought Avatar the Last Airbender was the single most unfaithful adaption in all of movie history, but Dragonball Evolution makes that movie seem like it's the most faithful thing ever.None of the characters looks like their anime counterparts, Piccolo looks like Martian Manhunter in Zack Snyder's Justice League. For some reason, there's both Airbending as well as the Force used in this movie, even though I have never seen those once in the anime. Most of the characters here barely act like their anime counterparts. I swear, if the name ""Dragonball"" wasn't slapped on the title and the characters had different names I would've thought this was just some random action-fantasy movie.But if you're not a fan of the anime, then trust me, this movie would STILL be awful.Its storyline is stupid and is filled with more plot holes than Swiss cheese. The MC and the love interest have absolutely zero chemistry with each other. The acting is either bland or too over-the-top. The CGI is extremely poor, and while I know they're limited with a rather small budget, it's still more terrible than what it should have been.Though, credit where credit is due, the fight scenes are so ridiculous they are funny and Roshi's actor is also extremely silly, which makes him funny. If not for those, I would've rated this a 1 instead of a 3.",Negative
1113,"This movie does not do justice to the anime and neither to the manga. James Wang directed this? Production must have used him as bait for the audience. Pieces of the original story are put together and thrown to the spectators that has to put them together and recompose the picture. Lame dialogues, acting and CGI. Watch something else.",Negative
1114,"Like most, i was hyped when this was released, but my god what a load of rubbish this was. It gained notoriety in the last few years purely because of how awful it is, James Wong should be embarrassed, and as others have said, the story and character changes were unnecessary. I'll be fair and say Emmy Rossum was convincing as Bulma with American sass, along with Chow Yun-Fat who added a touch of that famously eccentric East-Asian humor, it's just a pity nothing worked too well outside of that. There was so much material to work with, and so many story arcs to choose from, and the best they could do was make Goku a highschool kid, and turn Piccolo into a generic villain of the week. I really hope if ever the remake comes into fruition, the movie does a better job and utilizes the source material a bit more",Negative
1115,"I saw the film for the first time recently on television and since I refused to see the film in theaters because the trailers showed what looked a godawful cash in of an adaptation, I thought ""I'll give it a shot, how bad can it be?"" For the first time, I can honestly say that it hurt to watch a movie. Seriously, watching this movie left me in physical pain, that's how bad it was.Like many, I grew up following Dragonball Z. Actually I had seen Dragonball first but only a few episodes and then it was years before I found DBZ and I was hooked. Sure in hindsight the stories were flimsy and contained more padding than a junior high school student but I was drawn in by characters like Gohan and Krillin as well as the fighting scenes when they did happen.Enough happy times, time for the plot of this movie. Goku is a young, happy boy living by himself in the woods, he is freakishly strong and has a tail and completely ignorant to the outside world until -- oh I'm sorry, that's actually the original storyline from Akira Toriyama. No, instead we have Goku in high school.GOKU IN HIGH SCHOOL!? Not even 15 minutes and already this film is ruined but wait, it gets even WORSE! Not only is Goku in high school but Goku is, as one youtube critic put it: ""a whining little crapsack who never smiles."" Did I also mention that they took away his tail? Then we have Bulma, played Emma Rossum doing a fantastic impression of a wooden cutout...oh and they also screwed up her character. Yes in the anime she was shallow, cowardly and selfish but you know what, she was actually the most normal character in the anime, aside from being a super-genius that is. DBE's Bulma seemed more like a Bond-girl reject, a gun toting Jean-Claude Van Damme wannabe. Oh and I love how she doesn't have blue hair because the creative ""talents"" thought it would be unrealistic...THE SHOW HAS DINOSAURS, SPACE ALIENS THAT CAN DESTROY PLANETS WITH A FINGER, TALKING ANIMALS, HOUSES COMING FROM CAPSULES AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST MACGUFFIN'S THERE IS AND THEY THINK BULMA HAVING BLUE HAIR IS UNREALISTIC!? And then there's Master Roshi...they just didn't even try to be faithful. Not even a beard, just Chow Yun-Fat waiting for his hopefully massive pay check.And don't me started on Chi-Chi, Yamcha or Piccolo. I'm actually amazed they found a way to make Yamcha's character even more useless than Toriyama did in DBZ.This film is awful! Just a complete and utter neutering of a flagship franchise. Yes changes are expected BUT TO BASICALLY GIVE A GIANT MIDDLE FINGER TO WHAT AKIRA TORIYAMA PRODUCED IS UNFORGIVABLE!",Negative

1117,"If there was a way to rate this a 0, it would still be worth a negative 10..This is such a horrendous movie that holds zero likeness towards Dragon Ball other than a name and character names. Aside from those things this has zero to do with what Toryiama created.With the technology we have these days, there should be an effort to erase this from existence and do right by the franchise with a real and legit live action worthy of the Dragon Ball name.",Negative
1118,"I don't even know where to begin on how this film messed up a great animation series. This movie didn't even touch the show in anyway other than the names of the characters & moves. This is the worst depiction of DragonBall. Fox has to do better. Try again, get characters that fit the roll. And who actually look somewhere near the characters. If not that. Give the characters their original personalities. I think k this was half asked and not cared about at all. Total waste of time & money went into this film.",Negative
1119,"Everything in this movie DOES NOT resemble the real Dragon Ball anime series. Dragon Ball is one of the greatest stories ever made, yet this movie is not even close to a single episode from the original.This movie remains me of two other Hollywood made movies based on two beloved video games series:Double Dragon, and Super Mario Bros.Those games are fun, they have an ""interesting"" story, the cartoon series are fun to watch, yet the movies suck, they are lame.It's almost as if Hollywood were intentionally trying to remake awesome series from Asia with the lowest crappiest quality as possible to make them look bad. The only thing not added this time was musical intervals with the typical dancing and the singing to add their typical touch of junk.Avoid this movie like the plague.",Negative
1120,This is like the 1998 Godzilla movie. This is NOT dragon ball at all. They ruined all the characters. They made goku go to school to appeal to the younger audience. The cgi is awful. Just everything about this movie is a disgrace to dragon ball,Negative
1121,"It has nothing in common whit the dragonball animation series. Its a totally different universe, they just stole some ideas and characters from it and turned it into a ridiculous childish movie. Off course dragonball is made for children but in the animation series the makers created a deep and very interesting universe whit extremely powerful characters who combine martial arts whit fantastic powers.When i watched that series long ago i really wanted to be like those characters,i wished i could make my hair turn yellow while flames cover my body and all the dirt flying up and started spinning around me.I was expecting the same feeling from that movie, i know its not easy to replicate that but they didn't even try.Dragonball deserves a serious movie really based upon the fantastic universe we know from the animation series.Don't bother watching this.",Negative

1123,"Decent enough watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend if you're a fan of ""Dragon Ball"".I was so conflicted after watching this that I binged all 5 seasons of ""Dragon Ball"" (subtitled) just to compare it to the source material, and this movie is full of (message redacted).If I had never heard of anime, then this would actually stand on its own just fine. It has a stellar cast (Yun-Fat Chow, Justin Chatwin, Emmy Rossum, and Jamie Chung), good production value (energy attacks and action), and a relatively good story line.However, being a fan of the anime, this comes dangerously close to being ""Avatar"" in its level of infidelity. This would have been a great story to put into the Dragon Ball universe, but you have to use different characters.I'll avoid going on, in great detail, about everything it left out, and just say that its a problem in the design of the movie: it wasn't meant to be condensed into one movie, its a series for a reason.Give it a watch, it'll either be a good time, or it'll at least get your blood pumping a bit.",Negative
1124,"I love this movie, sounds like it's awesome! I wish it got a better review, but by me, it's a solid 10/10. To those who watched it, you're lucky. I only watched a 4th of it before my friend turned it off -_- But it's still the best. Just like The Last Airbender movie. Perfect.It doesn't follow the story of the anime or the manga much, which is kind of a minus, but it's a fine movie. I think they need to make a sequel, even though this movie was very, very underrated. As I said, could watch barely any of it before my ""friend"" just turned the movie off, but I might watch it again if he isn't around, so I can write a better review. But I REALLY, REALLY hope you people reading this don't hate me for loving the movie. End of review. Sorry it was short.",Negative

There was a few minor things that I didn't like about it, but I thought it actually represented the characters somewhat true to the series. I also think that the movie summed up the whole dragon ball series' story in about an hour and a half, but to be perfectly honest the story for dragon ball really doesn't make much sense either, but they did an okay job putting it on the big screen. I do have to admit that I probably wouldn't watch this movie again unless it just happened to be on t.v. and there was nothing better on, and I definitely would not buy the movie, but it is worth seeing at least once. All and all, I thought it was pretty entertaining.",Negative
1126,"This film i am especially angry off, simply because I'm a huge fan of dragonball, and this film is an awful representation of the cartoon. First of all, Dragonball is not a kids cartoon, its very funny, very exiting and definitely the best cartoon ever, and thats not even Dragonball Z. Now being a fan of Dragonaball, i was very exited about this film and was eagerly anticipating the release of this film thinking that it would be of the same calibre of, say, the Transformers movie, which was surprisingly very good. But i was extremely disappointed not only of the poor quality of the film, or the terrible acting in this film but the many many plot holes in the film which don't make sense compared to the program. For example; grampa gohan dies when goku is really young, which by the way is near the age of goku when he first meets bulma (who has blue hair), master roshi doesn't look anything like he does in the film or live where he does, the kamehame wave is always blue, piccolo doesn't look like that, ookazi isn't piccolo's side kick, or is part of goku ready to be awakened within him and my god, they are not only not so pathetically weak as they are in the film but there characters are nothing, NOTHING like the film! i could go on for days, but, thats not the point of this review, the point is that this live action dragonball movie, is so pathetically awful, terribly written and acted, that it actually makes Dragonball look a hell of a lot worse which isn't fair, because its a cracking cartoon.",Negative

Being a massive Dragon Ball Z fan, this movie got me so angry within the first 30 minutes of watching it.I am so ashamed, Please if you intend to watch this Don't!this got me so angry and i want to spit in the directors faces. they no doubt even watched the series or read it. All they did was get the characters names, throw in the dragon balls and thats it.They should be sued for putting such a brilliant manage/anime to disgrace.The actors were pathetic and didn't even play the characters right. All in all, this movie was nothing like the series and it makes me sick seeing these actors in future films to come.",Negative
1128,"Nothing in this film makes sense and I cant believe that the people involved had the audacity to release it and charge people for it. The fact that this film exists proves that not anyone can make a movie. I am biased with this film as I am a true DragonBall Z fan. But I feel that majority of the people who paid to watch this film are fans of the anime. Everything about this film is garbage. From the acting to the story to the dialogue. If you want to know what NOT to do when making a film, just watch this. The people who worked on this film clearly had no respect for the fans or the amazing story on which it's based. If you are going to watch it, then please prepare yourself for what I feel is the worst movie ever made. Doesn't deserve a grade of 1.",Negative

How could DB be sold out like this? HOOOOOW? WHHYY? My 8 month old daughter hated it. How can I tell that she hated it?

1131,"I have not been a dragon ball fan for very long, during the covid19 lockdown I had a lot of downtime so I watched the entire dragon ball lineup of anime, and Eversince I would call myself a casual fan of the franchise. When I learned that this film inspired the resurrection of the dragon ball franchise, mainly because of how the creator( Akira Toriyama) of the manga was so mad at this film and what it did to his creation he brought back the series by spearheading the production of Dragon Ball Battle Of gods which at the time of release had been the first film released in 17 years. I also heard about this film from a few movie reviewers like Chris Stuckmmen. I knew that I had to watch the film because of its reputation and my newfound interest in the dragon ball franchise.After finding it on Disney plus I decided to give it a watch to see for myself just how bad it was..... that was a mistake. This film pays zero respect to the material and is a complete utter mess from characters to the story, action effects, acting, and having zero to do with the anime/manga it is trying to adapt.It reminds me som much of M. Night Shyamalan's Last air bender movie and how it went out of its way to shame the source material and throw out everything that made their original properties so beloved.There is little more I can say that hasn't already been said. But I am grateful somewhat because this film lead to the creation of Battle of Gods my first exposure to the dragon ball property and led to the creation of my favorite character of the franchise Beerus.

Some of the feature length DBZ/DB films contradict the cartoon TV series and other spin offs.For me, the start of the film was a little like karate kid (don't let that put you off :) )I thought the characters where portrayed well and not to many from the anime appeared.It had us all gripped in the first 5 mins, I was worried that my partner would not like it at all.We saw this at the cinema, the cinema had lots of kids in it and they were all quite throughout the movie. Kids quite in the cinema = good kid film.

I recently watched this for podcast work and it was extremely difficult to get through. I had to pause, step away and take break.

It should never have come to film. This movie is a profanity in and of itself. Like to get angry? Watch it. Otherwise, don't. Need ten lines minimum, so lets review some more.

Dragonball Evolution is not only the worst movie adaptation ever conceived, but one of the worst movies of ALL TIME. In the history of cinema. Granted, i never watched the anime, but do i really need to see the source material to tell you how bad it is? What makes this horrendous is Justin Chatwin. He can't act in this. It really makes Robbie's mysterious reveal at the end of War of the Worlds seem more logical than HOW IN THE H CAN YOU NOT SAY A LINE LIKE YOU MEAN IT?

1139,"While the film was fun to watch and a great piece of visual that would keep the kids occupied for an hour on a Saturday morning, it was horrible. And not just as an adaptation of a classic story, but as a stand alone film; just bad. I understand that making a film adaptation of a television show, or comic series is difficult because there's usually tons of information that's been introduced throughout numerous episodes and issues. Somehow, the screen-writer has to summarize all of it to fit in to a 1 - 3 hour film. It's not easy. But what I don't get, is why virtually every adaptation of a show, or graphic novel or video game (This film of course being no exception) unnecessarily changes key elements of the original story. It's usually elements such as a character's origins or abilities; things that gave the character charisma to begin with. As a fan of the original anime, i was of course furious at how many idiotic changes were made to the storyline, props and character backgrounds. However, I was able to put aside my loyalty to the show and observe the film as a spectator and critique. And still didn't find very much that was redeeming about it. As a stand alone film, it needed much tweaking to be considered a good movie. And while I'd like to say that a good film doesn't need to follow another storyline regardless of it's basis and can shine on it's own... In the case of Dragonball, it's unfortunately not at all true. I mean, let's face it: Dragonball the series told a good story!! and deviating from that, destroyed the film. So once again like so many other remake films (Such as Last Airbender, Spider-Man, The Hulk, X-Men, etc.) this film tanked because the screen writers tried to ""outcreate"" the original classics. Learn your lesson people!! Don't try to improve upon classics!!",Negative
1140,"Lets understand, most people going to this movie grew up watching Dragon Ball (Z,XT,ABC,XP) or whatever. Most followed Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, and loved the characters from Goku to Yamcha. (Krillen was missing)I thought the movie followed the story line as best as non-animated characters can. It is a movie people! I loved all the characters the plot (Although known) and the settings. OK, the Dragon could have been better and Piccolo was mucked (Does look like a Buffy vampire) and a few more let me say Director's vision issues. But, I loved the movie!Anyone who followed the animation, should like the movie. NOTE: The marketing team is doing a horrible job promoting the movie on television. Say what it is not the garbage I saw on TV. The bad promotion made me take time out of my day to see the movie, before I start reading the bad reviews from people who obviously did not see the movie.",Negative

If you want to enjoy the movie do not think of it as a DBZ movie make believe this movie has nothing to do with Dragon B all Z and only then would you enjoy it.Watching this movie with high expectations is the worst thing to can do. The only thing this movie has in common with DBZ is the names they use in the movie so, don't expected anything you were use to seeing in the cartoon show. In conclusion, the movie was not that bad when you don't think of it as a DBZ movie but more of a normal action movie.",Negative
1142,"Full disclosure, I'm not a fan of the comics or cartoon, it's seems like a serial in which you need to know all of it to enjoy any of it. Much like the one episode of the cartoon I tried to watch, with this movie I didn't know if I should take none of it seriously since it feels silly or all of it seriously since the world is at stake? The logic is very farfetched and it's hard to know when you're supposed to turn your brain off or pay attention to what you're watching, so I was lost a few times. Overall though, I could see this fitting into the movie rotation of a 6-8-year-old boy. However, its far too generic, derivative and homogenized to be enjoyable to anyone else, especially fans of the source material.",Negative
1143,"This movie was completely unpredictable when the trailers came out. Yes there was the fight scene and explosions and I could tell it wasn't going to suit the cartoon that well but to be fair, even fox knows that a movie with blond, giant haired body builders that are constantly on fire throwing each other through buildings isn't going to work.The movie itself was a complete let down but the idea had potential. In the hands of someone who actually knew what they were doing this could have been a very good film. Unfortunately for the public, we were stuck with James Wong who got the whole thing completely wrong. Besides doing his own job terribly he allowed other poorly skilled staff to ruin the film. The special effects were horribly unbelievable and the costumes were pretty stupid. I also personally would like to punch the script writer who thought that because it was based on a-let's face it- ever so slightly cheesy cartoon show they could make it as sappy as they wanted.I'm not saying that Dragonball Evolution is a bad movie altogether. If it was redone by one of the marvel comic movie directors it could be very good but considering how much of an atrocity this movie was I doubt any one would like to go near the idea of a live action version of Dragonball anytime soon",Negative

For someone who watched the anime is insulting what they did with the story until the time comes that it is impossible finish the movie. For those who have not seen the anime, is a remix of teen movie, ill- conceived adventure, heroes and villains unconvincing underdeveloped. A watchable movie for children under 12, but if necessary it is better to make them see the original anime before this shame. I could write endless tube faults the movie, not only in history (that's the worst that can happen to a fan of Dragon Ball), but the script also poorly developed, the actions run down and address unintelligible, but it would be a waste of time. It is best to pretend that the movie never existed.",Negative
1145,"Film adaptation of comic book characters, anime or TV shows is always a touchy subject.

The manga has given rise to two anime series that had a huge success worldwide: Dragon Ball based on the first 16 volumes of the manga, and Dragon Ball Z based on the last 26 volumes. There is still Dragon Ball GT, a third series whose history is not based on the manga. It is through the series that the series really became popular and became fever world in the 90s, winning millions of fans, mostly boys, and immense popularity to this day. When it announced an adjustment to theaters fans were thrilled, but then came the news that would be a live-action version, with real actors, not animated. From that point, the tragedy was announced. First would be hard to imagine in real life characters with appearances of anime: Goku with that huge hair, Bulma hair all blue, all green Piccolo. Secondly the film would have to have a script and electrifying special effects first class to try to transmit at least not so vexatious the complex history of the world Dragon Ball.The script is more or less the synopsis of the series. At age 18 Goku (Justin Chatwin) wins gift from his grandfather, Grohan (Randall Duk Kim), a ball called Dragon Ball. Within it are floating four-star. There are only six other identical spheres, and who has all in its domain have a desire perfectly realized. Goku's past is related to the existence of spheres, but he himself does not know. Grohan promises to tell the truth on your birthday dinner, but the young man flees to the party of Chi Chi (Jamie Chung), his classmate. In the period that is missing a tragedy occurs in your home, which makes Goku and his friends depart to gather the seven Dragon Balls.Directed by James Wong (Final Destination (2000)) and scripted by Ben Ramsey, the greatest proof that the potential of the mythology of the series was not even a little explored is the lasting just over an hour. With the screenplay based on the series Z , which already has a more adult Goku and Piccolo facing, one of his first threats, what we see is the total lack of concern of the filmmakers with the series, a total disrespect. A series that has millions of fans around the world not deserved a script written by someone who seems to have read some information on the internet about what it was about the show and writing the script in a few hours. There is no relation with mythology or any exploitation of the past of the characters. For a work so complex was expect a film with at least two hours, so that all the main points and the essence of the original work was transmitted to the public. Screenwriter took the main story and its main elements (Kamehameha, Ki, villain Piccolo) and tried to make something similar to the design. Attempting to what is valid and tried to leave some aspects similar to the anime (effects of energy out of his hands, fights in the air, a sense of humor, quick movements fighting) but missed much.Dragon Ball is a series known for its exaggeration, the mood always present, and epic battles watered much destruction. Are always extremely difficult to win battles with opponents who lead the protagonists to exhaustion. Except mood that appears sporadically, none of the other characteristics mentioned are the soul of the series, are noticeable. The human version of each of the characters is really pathetic and pitiable. The Goku is a boy with hair slightly creepy and without the same innocence. Physically, it is far from the physical appearance of sayajean most feared in the world. And the work of Chatwin in dramatic moments, like his grandfather's death, not passing any sense to the audience. Bulma, played by Emmy Rossum, is insignificant and not nearly resembles the restless character, and is always desperate to get a boyfriend. Only your intelligence is untouched. She was able to invent a machine that can capture the energy emitted by the balls. The naughtiness Master Roshi, which appears very light and even out of context. James Marsden, who gives life to the villain Piccolo, is laughable in its appearance and also lost any dramatic density. In the series he is a complex character, because in the movie he just wants to have the balls to conduct a proper desire. And another thing: Why does he want the ball to dominate the world and destroy everything if he can do it all '. The only actress with a bit of charisma is the beautiful Jamie Chung as Chi Chi. The rest, helped by poor characterization, does not match the interpretations.The script totally cliché is still capable of moments more than unbelievable, for example, when the grandfather of Goku is almost dying, he tells Goku and emotional prophetic phrase: ""Always have faith in who you are."" Following Goku meets Bulma and decide to go after the Dragon Balls. Before they go into the house of Master Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat) to help Goku to develop his powers.What we see is a huge disappointment to fans of the series and manga. Every mythology has been set aside to try to do something more commercial, based only on the action. The big problem is that the technical part of the movie is a flop. It is almost unbelievable the amount of problems in several areas. The special effects are one of the worst ever seen in recent cinema. Even nowadays that films with small budgets get good results, what we see with one of the series where the effects would be the big draw of an adaptation with actors, is deplorable. If the struggle to be saved with some good choreography, scenarios created by computer or physically small spoil everything, especially in the climax. In one of the worst final battles for a movie already, the villain Piccolo comes to seem ridiculous, failing to put fear into anyone, being defeated with ease after a fight without emotion.Everyone would love to see movies in the Dragon Ball anime version or at least one director and crew that match a bill that would have everything to be great. With no positive aspect to be noted, the film is a big waste of time, which only served to ridicule a series that has a huge legion of fans around the world.",Negative
1146,"It's a feel-good movie, maybe not spot on like the original Dragon Ball Z that I grew up with, but it's worth the watch. Goku is portrayed as he should; clever, witty, humble, and humorous. The fight scenes are more realistic to the eyes, rather than being fully edited with CGI and special effects. The storyline and character development is well-paced. The only thing that was unsettling is the fact that Bulma looked exactly like Arianna Grande. Overall, Dragon Ball Evolution is humorous, diverse, and an enjoyable film in our modern times.",Negative
1147,"What the hell? What in the holy sanity of the world (even though barely is left) happened here? What the crap? This is beyond repairable. I can't even live this down. The one thing they got right...the names. That's IT! Not even the origin of the Dragonballs was correct. Kami made them, not 7 gods or whatever they heck they wanted to try to pull off. Any huge fan of DBZ will never forgive the people that allowed this movie to happen. If they took everything that was DBZ related and chucked it out (which would have been easy) then it'd be a pretty good movie in itself. Not great, not horrible, just OK. But this...Oh my ******* god. Master Roshi wasn't the right age, Grandpa Gohan shouldn't have been alive to begin with, Bulma has guns? and is hot? Yamcha has weird hair, Goku doesn't have the right hair, not enough blasts, not cool enough fighting, shitty storyline, and what's with the PG rating? Ooh yea, kids totally could handle the show. It was pretty damn violent and it had quite a bit of blood in it. The show was AWESOME. I grew up with it (yes I know, I'm a hypocrite) but I watched every episode, owned TONS of action figures, I mean I was obsessed. I always dreamed one day of having a DBZ movie on the big screen. I was so excited when I heard about this...but I just had my dream destroyed, obliterated, because of this crap. I guess I'll just have to buy all the seasons of DBZ...relive the good days. You guys who made this movie, suck. Hard. Thanks a lot. Bastards.",Negative
1148,"I knew this movie was gonna suck the moment i saw Goku played by the whitest guy in existence. However, I watched it later on an airplane cause it was free and i had nothing else to do. They pretty much ruined the whole series. Why they tried to make it modern with Goku being some nerd in high school, I will never know. I thought some parts of the movie were pretty hilarious because of how poorly this movie was made. The only thing I actually like about the movie was Jamie Chung (chi chi) because she's pretty cute. Other than that, this is a garbage movie and I pray to god that there is never a sequel to this piece of trash.",Negative
1149,"Truth be told I came to this movie with a dead set hatred I had the same feelings that a bunch of fans seem to be having, that 20th Century was going to completely destroy Dragonball. I walked out of that theater with a smile and curiosity blazing. I am a long time fan of the entire Dragonball series (DB, DBZ, and yes even GT) and throughout the entire movie at the back of my brain I knew this was different, that these filmmakers had diverged greatly from the source materials, and to the ""hardcore"" DB fan I feel this is the primary reason for hate as it was mine. That nagging thought seemed to dwindle as I watched, yes there were many changes to the story and yes the characters and locations have been tweaked a bit, but overall I began to like it, dare I say I became attached to these representations of long beloved characters.Overall the movie was well composed. The script was good with bits of decent humor tossed in my only gripe there was the fact that they pronounce ki like 'key' instead of 'kai' which I guess isn't really a flaw since it can be pronounced either way. The actors played their roles well. I must admit that Chatwin's portrayal of Goku seemed a mite bit weak (but hey it might improve in subsequent movies, if there are any), and Rossum's Bulma seemed a little more violent that I really expected. The only actors I can really draw poor ratings against have to be Tamura (Mai) and Marsters (Piccolo) and even then my only faults with them are that both have about maybe 10 lines of dialog each in the whole movie, and Piccolo's make-up was... odd I guess would be the word. The effects were great, whoever did the effects appeared to have allot of fun with particles when it came to the attacks especially in the final battle. The only problem there was that Oozaru (the big ape) was a bit strange, the scene with him in it is and incredibly fast scene and the camera angles chosen combined with the pace make it hard to discern that Oozaru is even an ape at all in points or if it is just a person in a large monkey suit. The fight scenes were pretty cool as well, very well choreographed in my opinion. The whole thing made me wish it was a bit longer, actually, the movie seemed short even though I've heard that the American release is a half hour longer than the Japanese one.All in all what I guess I'm trying to say is I am a Dragonball fan and at heart I genuinely liked the movie. In the end that final bit played and the credits rolled and I was left sitting in my seat asking for more and questioning where they will take it next. I truly hope that those haters out there if you hate it and haven't seen it please go see it and give it a fair shot. If you have seen it and you still don't like it think of this; Though the story may diverge and the characters are a little different, this movie is introducing a slightly newer generation to Dragonball which ended a little over a decade ago (if you include GT from 97'). Give this movie a look see you will be surprised at how good it actually is and I truthfully hope that there will be more in the near future.",Negative
1150,"The Dragonball series had sooooo much potential to be an excellent live action franchise. The series has a loyal fan base and the action of DB would appeal to any movie lover, but in order for this to happen the franchise must be handled by people who know what the HELL DRAGONBALL was about. This garbage isn't Dragonball, this movie is more closer to High School musical than it is to DB. You can tell the writers of this crap weren't fans of the series, because the only similarities between DB and this movie is the Title and some Character names. I am not going to place the blame on the actors because it isn't their fault that the writing and casting sucked. (How are going to have a white Goku??? That's like having a Japanese Superman...It doesn't make sense)...But yea don't waste you time with this one....",Negative
1151,"The movie its really bad, the idea was good. Its a shame of all Dragon ball Z fans. It would be so nice if someone make a proper movie of Dragon Ball Z, with effects of Man of Steel/Avengers/The Last Airbender/Matrix/Lord of the Rings/etc... it shouldn't be that hard since every decent action movie has acceptable effects, its not even possible to take this movie serious. I guess all the fans of the Dragon ball Z saga will have a long wait for someone to make a decent movie, its the kind of movies its not even worth the time to watch online or something, maybe only for support issues, I've watched on cinema and was really a waste.",Negative
1152,"This movie was actually pretty good, a lot better than I was lead to believe by the reviews on this site and others across the net. I will admit it could have definitely been better.A few details didn't line up with the original dragon ball anime but, there were a lot of things that hearken back to its origins which as a fan of the anime I appreciated. One must keep in mind that this movie is based on dragonball not dragonball z. I feel that the movie main story is very similar to the original story without just flat out reproducing it. And the effects are astoundingThe one major problem I have with it is that the fight scenes aren't long enough I say that if your a dragon ball fan you should see the movie and look forward to the sequels which are rumored to already be green lit.",Negative
1153,"I really don't even need to review this movie because it was so awful and just know where near the original show. I grew up watching Dragonball as well as DBZ and DBGT and im just afraid to even think of what the director would do if he ever decided to make a sequel. Im all for switching things up a bit but really? Goku goes to high school? They find the dragonballs in 5 minutes? The Oozaru is only 8 feet tall? And i could point out even more FAILS if i wanted to but there's honestly nothing I can put on this review that you already haven't seen on like a million other disappointed fans. Ill be honest this movie is as bad if not just as bad as the Green Lantern that just came out a few months ago. And im not one to judge a movie just by the trailers or even word of mouth, but I think I might have to just go by the trailers from now on and save myself the pain of watching a movie that shouldn't have been made. Also, casting could have been a thousand times better. None of the characters are believable in their roles.",Negative
1154,Jesus Christ this was horrible. I'd rather watch 2017 Death Note than this pile of 💩,Negative
1155,Do NOT watch this terrible terrible terrible movie. The story is poorly told and the acting is even worse. I want my time back! Who ever came up with screenplay surely never saw ONE episode of the original anime.,Negative
1156,"Instantly it contradicts itself saying oozaru was around 10,000 years ago but Goku is only in his teens. Then every 5 seconds something new insults the original series. It would be better to have your head burned off or shave your eyes. It would be better to chew off your own arm than to watch this. The movie was obviously a deliberate act of spite. There is no explanation for how cruel this is. The fanboys aren't joking, even if you haven't seen a single episode of Dragonball, this movie is still hellspawn and it also trashes the original series in a obvious deliberate act of spite. Its movies like this that I think hell may be here on earth.The thing is, me and my friends used to watch ""Bad Movies"" for fun. Like ""A dangerous woman"" or ""Neverending Story 3"" or ""Manos the hands of fate... the god of boredom"" lol... and anything that looked really bad. Those movies were a lot of laughs. Dragonball Evolution is worse than watching a 2 month marathon of horror films like ""The Cell"" or ""Hostile"" and ""Schindlers List"" in a row.Why? Because unlike propaganda films, this film had no political motivation other than to smash the dreams of all the people who love the anime so much. Everything was the polar opposite of the manga. Goku wanted to get girls instead of being pure hearted, he went to high school, the dialog was garbage, the film was rushed, the effects were trash. But the story, holy !@$%. I mean, it would have been better to release 2 hours of a blank screen with silence. I would have appreciated that more. Or even just 2 hours of anything but this. Anything about this movie was bad. I am not sure if the soundtrack was bad because watching the film gave me a headache.I remember showing 15 minutes of the film by ""skimming"" to a friend and we both got sick, I almost threw up and we spent the next couple days depressed. This was only to do my civil duty to show what the face of Satan looks like. I actually had unfortunately saw it a second time with another friend because he wanted to know what it was like to spend an hour in hell. Again, we got sick.So this is coming from a guy who loved ""The Room"" and thinks it was a maserpiece of ""Bad Movie Comedy"". But Dragonball on the other hand really is that bad. Its like the movie ""The Ring"" but in real life. This movie in comparison would make Mother Theresa think ""Salo"" was ""Citizen Kane"" after watching this.The only reason I could think anyone would have refused to let Akira participate would be that they deliberately wanted to make the worlds worst movie.Akira Toriyama is such a hero, that he made ""Dragonball Z: Battle of the Gods"" and it was so obvious he made it because he felt that he needed to sooth the broken hearts and souls of people who suffered after GT/Evolution. But even GT is a masterpiece compare to this film.With that said ""Dragonball Z: Battle of the Gods"" was one of the best films ever made in the Dragonball series. And nothing beats the original series of Dragonball. I'm a bigger Dragonball fan than Dragonball Z actually. Anyways, had to end on a positive note. This is the only movie I ever reviewed on IMDb. It can't be said enough. If you see a copy of this in the stores, vandalize it. If you know anyone with a copy, go on to their hard drive and delete it. If you see a copy lying around, throw it in the trash. Hopefully if we all do that, we can eliminate the film from existence.",Negative
1157,"To start, this film suffers from the pox of many such films:Why would the bad guy want to totally destroy Earth in the first place? What, is it in the way of his intergalactic highway construction company? Even if it was ""revenge"", destroy the enemy but keep the very, very valuable planet.Of course, no one ever accused bad guys of sanity. Still, this is a very old, overused, and trite plot line that started the film off on the wrong foot.The second problem is that it's Dragonball. Simplisic-minded fighter video games are not likely to translate to a good story on the main screen. It certainly didn't on this one. The only thing this has going for it is pretty girls... and those can be found in any film. (They likely spent a significant portion of the film's budget on push-up bras.)Beyond that... the goofy and highly-predictable story, the 2D characters, poorly-written script, and barely-there humor only lead to the extremely-predictable during-credits ending. The first 3/4 of the movie were at least somewhat entertaining in a ""solid action adventure without depth"" sort of way... but the final 15 minutes were a significant letdown, with a lazy and juvenile ending.But what did we expect? When we go into a film with ""Dragonball"" or ""Transformers"" in the title, we shouldn't be expecting cerebral. It's going to be pretty much casting fireballs all the way through.Three stars for not making a totally abominable film. No more than that due to the formulaic, predictable and cliche story line. Nothing new here folks.",Negative
1158,"I hated this movie from the get-go. I knew that this was going to turn out to be so bad just from watching the trailer and behind the scenes of this movie. I didn't even wanna see it, my mom dragged me to see this monstrosity. There I was sitting in the movie theater with Goku training with his grandpa and such. Then he is the typical bullied boy in high school... HIGH SCHOOL I tell you. Why would Goku be in a high school? That makes no sense. Oh, and he falls in love with Chi chi. Now I didn't watch Dragonball Z when I was a kid but even I KNEW that it wasn't how that happened. Ugh... I wanted to leave the movie theater so bad because it was just too terrible. From the plot, dialog, script, character casting, and EVERYTHING. Most of the actors don't look like the characters but then again, it was based off an anime so that's understandable. I hated how they portrayed Piccolo in this because he looked so ridiculous. Anyway, even for a non fan like me, I knew that this movie isn't exactly like the anime and manga. I wasn't even a fan of the anime/manga but even I knew that this is so inaccurate. I regret spending money on this but I didn't wait for the DVD version of this movie. I saw this movie on television back in 2012 and I still couldn't bear to watch it.",Negative
1159,"I don't know why all this hate's floating around for this movie, but the thing is pure win. Start to finish, it captures the essence of the Anime and the emotions I felt when I first watched it like 10 years ago. I felt like a 13-year-old watching Dragonball Z all over again! They took all the goofy fighting, goofy animation, epic plot lines, crazy characters, and condensed them amazingly from what would have probably been like a million DBZ episodes to a 90-minute film. They even had a minute-long charge scene!Seriously, don't listen to all the crap on here. Go watch this movie, and try to be a kid again.",Negative
1160,"OK so the Movie wasn't great but it wasn't that bad. I am a huge Dragon Ball, Dragonball Z, and Dragonball GT fan. I own and have watched every episode. I think that you first have to realize that this is a Dragon Ball movie not a Dragonball Z movie. Yes it's not exactly like the anime but did you really expect it to be. First there is no way the live action characters will look exactly like the anime they are real people not cartoons. Also as for the fighting, have any of you actually watched Dragon Ball it was very comedic in its fighting especially early on in the series. Dragon Ball was a long series and they tried to cram it into a single movie. There were some missing components in the movie and some changes. I think overall it wasn't that bad. I know I will buy it when it comes out on DVD. Also if they make a sequel I will watch it.",Negative
1161,"This movie is nothing in comparison to the original Dragon ball/DBZ anime if they made a movie out of dbz properly that would be sooo awesome!! But this one sadly was just awful. Piccolo was not like Piccolo, the dragon balls weren't made that way, everything about each character was wrong, Goku is much different. The feel of the anime is what gives Dragon Ball z that unique touch, but I guess we'll never have that technology to be able to make a good enough movie out of it. And they probably think there aren't enough fans, I think differently as I see how there are 6 million people who like the facebook page that alone is a lot for a Facebook page, and then the word spreads about how good it is and the advertisement should draw people to see it as the tech should be insane as the fights are just Awesome!",Negative
1162,"I can honestly say this movie made me appreciate the manga. I love it, but only got into it to impress a boy in my teen years. Seeing this god awful movie (which I knew would be bad, who DIDN'T know?), I want to go back and read the entire series just to wash it out of my brain. It feels like they pushed and pushed this movie back and like a school child who doesn't want to flunk by not turning in their project, they just threw together something and threw it out there hoping for participation points. They encompassed so much into the one movie that they had to leave out all the characters. How can you create Goku with no tail and a liking for girls? As my husband said, ""Goku thought marriage was something to eat!"" They wanted this movie to appeal to the ""consumer"", like every romantic comedy Disney channel production that is processed in Hollywood. God Bless the manga.",Negative
1163,"I'm no film buff, I'm not great with actors and directors names, but as a child I was one crazy Dragonball fan. For this exact reason I completely put off the possibility of me ever watching this film, especially due to the westernised feel of the flick from the trailer. But as I switched through the film channels on Sky today, I saw it was on and decided to give it a go, ""what's the worst that could happen?"" I thought to myself. Whatever the 'worst' was, this was still worse.AUTHENTICITY: This film was in no way, shape or form authentic to the original series. There were many slip ups which were so aloof from the original manga and TV cartoon. Let me list off a few problems that I had with this movie. I've never, EVER, known a Kamehameha to be used as a healing tool. It doesn't matter what context you take it in, firing a Kamehameha blast into the chest someone that is near dead would finish them off, not jump start them. Next, why didn't Piccolo look like a Namekian? He was wearing some crazy matrix suit and didn't even have antennas. I could just about live with Bulma and Yamcha's characters, but the romance between them? Oh please... did the story/script writer even see or study the original manga characters before including that ridiculous notion? Also, Oozaru can only be achieved by Saiyans who still have their tail intact! I was literally face-palming when he transformed as I'd seen no evidence of a tail up until that point, and even if there was, it would still be wrong as Grandpa Goku removed his tail as a child! My last point (though there are more) is that Shenron was tiny! I've become used to seeing a huge dragon folded over and over itself, this one just looked too normal. And the wish? Come on, Goku from DBZ would never just wish for Master Roshi to be brought back to life, the wish would have been to revive everyone who was killed by Piccolo, including his Grandpa! But anyway, enough of this. I'm definitely coming across as a DBGeek now! PERFORMANCES: I'm not entirely sure of any of the actors as such, but from what I saw, only Bulma (Emmy Rossum) and Master Roshi (Yun-Fat Chow) really made any effort to act like their characters. But in all cases, the dialogue was often very awkward and very unbelievable. The fight scenes were short, underwhelming and very unlike what DB fans have been treated to through the TV cartoons. The whole thing just shouted out 'Power Rangers' to me. Not a good look.EFFECTS: Glass half full, glass half full...*breathe*...I liked the look of the dragonballs... and the whole 'Transformer' thing with Bulma's vehicles... But the CGI landscapes looked so so fake, and the Ki blasts just didn't have that Dragonball feel. I don't want to say that the special effects were complete balls, but they just weren't right for Dragonball.OVERALL: The film overall is a huge flop. James Wong really has butchered a great series. I'm not quite sure who they were marketing this movie at. If it was to the DB fans, it's useless as it doesn't look or feel like DB, plus all of the glaring mistakes. If it's to the people who aren't DB fans, it's also useless. Why would someone who isn't a fan of the series want to watch a live film of a cartoon they didn't like or watch? Basically this film could only have been marketed at people who had never heard of Dragonball, and I don't think that is a very big market. In the future, if someone ever makes a real-life Dragonball movie again, I really hope that they do their homework on the series, cast the right actors, and get the effects right. Whoever gets this right, could have a good 5 to 8 successful 2-3 hour movies! Dragonball doesn't need to be westernised, we love it as it is!",Negative
1164,"Ow* Ow* Ow* Sorry, I was hitting my head on my desk. This movie is terrible! It's not just nothing like the show nor manga, not to mention getting all the characters completely wrong; it has insultingly bad CGI. I know I keep using this word, but it really is insultingly bad!I know I might get some hate for this, but for some reason, some of the characters in this movie are Asian. In the manga and anime, there actually isn't a confirmed continent known as Asia on their version of Earth. Therefore, none of the characters are actually Asian. There's not much difference in skin tone excluding the white ethnicity and black ethnicity, and no, that's not racist. It wouldn't have hurt to make their skin color not look so close to the actual color black, but it's not racist. Mr. Popo isn't even human!Now, back on topic, the acting is...pretty bad. There's awkward pauses at a lot of points, and Goku, for some reason, seems like a Hollywood heartthrob not to mention being in high school for some reason despite never going to grade school in the anime nor manga.Some of the characters are white while some of them are Asian...which again makes so little since. Even worse, ki blasts and energy attacks look a lot more like air bending from The Last Air Bender movie. The CGI is the equivalent of that turd everyone leaves in the toilet each morning.Akira Toriyama reportedly tried to put a lot more of his input into the movie, but he was shut out by the studio producers and/or executives.Master Roshi...I'm sorry. ""Master Roshi"" looks much younger in this movie.There's nothing redeeming about this movie!",Negative
1165,"Normally I break down my reviews into good and bad sections. So let's start with the goodGood:
Short runtime (85 minutes). This film respects your time and wraps up its awfulness in relatively short order.Bad:
Acting. The Goku actor feel pulled out of a bad CW high school drama. None of the actors feel engaged or like they want to be involved with this messScript. Truly awful writing, muddled concept, doesn't have any idea at all what its even trying to say or do.High School drama. Why is an anime about otherworld martial artists posing as a high school drama movie in the first place?Action - Terrible martial arts, terrible CG power effectsIts trying to play itself so seriously as well, that you can't even say its a fun romp / camp type movie, it just doesn't workI can't even speak to the lore / accuracy, as I wasn't a huge dragonball fan going in, though I have it on good authority that the accuracy is on par with the rest of the awful qualities of the film.",Negative
1166,It would take too long to write. My review is too short.,Negative
1167,"I knew it would be bad so I didn't have any expectations, you could say I watched it just for the heck of it...and I still regret it so much. Dear God, it was like watching Power Rangers shooting magic! Everything was bad: the acting was bad, the special effects were bad, the storyline was bad, for goodness sake, it was so bad I couldn't even laugh at it! Even if you try to watch it as completely unrelated to the manga/anime, it's still utter crap.I realize that recreating a story from 80s isn't easy but I just can't understand why they had to make it even more corny...and if you're trying to make it more realistic, you should stick to it to the end.",Negative
1168,It's a master piece. The special effect of the plot the charácters omg this Is the Best movie in the wooooooooorld i think the internet dont apreciate this movie but if you look the new Dragon Ball series and movies you Will check that thats a really good movie the only think that you say wow this Is really strange it's picolo design but well you can ignore that because it's a great villain with purpose and it's not a cat with op Powers AND the fact woho was film un México only says that it's a world film AND better that México series sorry but this Is the movie who you really nees to see it's a master piece.,Negative
1169,"But, for the life of my, I can't understand why I actually let myself be entertained by this. Yes, they took extensive liberties with the plot and characterizations, but for them to compress all of Dragonball down into an 86 minute long movie, some changes needed to be made, and in all, they really weren't that bad. What came out after all the Hollywood meddling was an actually fairly decent little action movie. Inoffensive, mildly entertaining, and with enough of the source material in it to make it recognizable. Justin Chatwin was serviceable as Goku, Emmy Rossum made a very good Bulma, and I don't think I could have picked anyone better that Chow Yun-Fat as Master Roshi. All the rest of the characters fall into the ""good enough"" level. It was actually refreshing to see him go back to his comedy roots a bit for this film. I am really perplexed at the people screaming, ""No Plot! OMG!!!"" this movie had just as much plot as the entire rest of the series of DB at any given time. DB isn't complex political intrigue or multi-layered character study. It's about people that fight. Period. The plot that was presented in this movie serviced that well enough. Another complaint is that this wasn't epic enough. What people seen to forget is that Dragonball, in it's very early days, started just as small as this movie. People didn't get thrown through mountains in the early days. Early Dragonball was more akin to Indiana Jones than the earths crust smashing excess that it became.If you want to hate this movie because of the flaws, fine, go ahead and hate. Just leave those of us that turned our brain off and enjoyed the movie for what it was alone.",Negative
1170,This movie is garbage horrible nothing like the anime.,Negative
1171,"This movie was so bad. It's not just the fact that it didn't resemble the manga or anime or anyway that made it bad, it was also very poorly constructed. So many plot holes, terrible acting, terrible fight choreography, poor character development, mediocre special effects, and a very short final battle...Who the hell are they marketing this to anyway? They've taken out the stuff that makes it good and different and replaced it with cliché lines. The main character, Goku, who is supposed to be AN ALIEN (therefore with a personality totally different from the humans), now he is a stupid overrated emo teen who only knows to think on girls...lol.. what kind of hero is that??? this no longer have the martial arts/sci-fi/fantasy as main thematics.. now Dragon Ball is a pure teen romantic movie.Because its an adaptation film from the popular anime\manga created by Toryiama, a few changes were expected, but that doesn't mean it should be so butchered from its source material (why call it DragonBall then??). I don't mind a different story or an alternate timeline. But its when you make a movie that is so removed from its source material, its not even recognizable anymore. The only thing they had for source material was names and the dragonballs itself, nothing else. It was a cash-in pure and simple (taking an advantage to the popular title), there was no effort on this movie at all, its a complete garbage.What it is ""killing"" me is the fact that James Wong and Co. are introducing the wrong Dragonball story to the world and with a new story that will put the fans in shock and the non-fans will think we fans are crazy by loving such franchise... DB do not deserve something like that.. it was an awesome show turned into a mockery!!",Negative
1172,"Nothing in this movie was enjoyable,acting was horrific, writing was horrific, it's almost like they have never watched a single episode of Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z. None of the characters were anywhere close to what they were in the show. Goku wasn't a cocky a-hole. Bulma barely ever fought, and she sure as hell was never in a serious fight. Piccolo was a lone wolf type of character so the fact he had followers is just absurd. Goku grandpa died when he was very young, not when he was 18. Roshi was an up beat kind of guy, not a metaphorically speaking boring old guy. Yamcha was pretty obnoxious on the show, but not that bad, probably the most accurately betrayed personality. But he was also a good fighter so him being completely useless was stupid. The kameamea wave was much more simple, not a bunch of complex hand movements that make him look stupid. Oh and body's don't float in lava. Overall just a terrible movie, definitely the most disappointed I have ever been by a single movie in my life, and I saw Indiana Jones 4 so that's saying something. My least favorite movie of all time, I would rather watch Son of the Mask 10 times in a row than watch this movie.",Negative
1173,". Dear Dragonball Evolution. Why did Goku charge when using the Kamehameha? Why wasn't a massive crater were the blast left? Why didn't the Dragon speak when the wish was about to be made? Why was Goku in high-school? Gohan went to high-school, not Goku. Why did Goku act like he was in pain when he fell against a wall? Why was Goku so slow? Why did Goku turn into an Ōzaru at an Eclipse? And without a tail? He can only turn into an Ōzaru if he has a tail or if he is in Super Sayian 4. Why was Piccolo lying in bed being attended by a Human? When he can regenerate a limb in a minute. Why did he refer to Goku as a Human? Why was he dancing to use the Kamehameha? Why did a Kamehameha restore life to Goku? Why was he almost killed with one gun shot? When he was killing dinosaurs when he was a kid. Why did you call it Dragonball when in Dragonball he is a kid? Why did you not make Bulma's hair completely blue? Why has your director, sponsors, entire crew and cast not been killed yet?",Negative

1175,"How anyone, fan or complete newcomer, could see this and enjoy it or even give it as high as three stars is beyond me. This sort of drivel should be discouraged by everyone, I implore you to burn every copy you find. Extreme? NO BURN IT. Yet again Hollywood has managed to grasp a decent concept, then suck out all its innards and compose a film with its deflated skin, perhaps we should destroy everything that's good, keep some photos, so that the morons with millions can't get their hands on it. NO Goku doesn't go to some cheesy typical American 'high school', he doesn't get bullied and he certainly doesn't have fights at parties with jocks. Mr Wong, I'm assuming, must be a big fan; 'wtf's going on with this?' I pondered as the film dribbled by, there is almost no resemblance in any of the elements of the film, I know I know its someone else's idea of Dragon Ball but Jesus Christ just don't call it Dragon Ball, that way you don't get the fans using your DVD as Frisbee's and you can keep the 12 year old's you've fooled and convince them to buy the lunch box.Rant over, i just mainly didn't understand why Hollywood feels the need to Americanise absolutely everything, I heard they planned to make a feature film of the classic AKIRA...in New York? WTF. 1. not everyone lives in America 2. if you do, if you go to see a film like Dragon Ball, why would u want it to be in America? 3. Hollywood needs to die, its time",Negative
1176,"I don't like DBZ at all so when I was on a 9 hour plane ride to Greece I thought I could enjoy this as a dumb action movie, I was wrong! I couldn't get through 10 minutes of this garbage fire, I even tried watching it with the volume off so I can ignore the horrible dialogue but I still couldn't get throught it. No joke I just decided to stare at a black screen for about a half hour until I fell asleep on the plane.",Negative
1177,"We went out to watch this film last night and all highly enjoyed it. It is fairly well paced with pretty good action scenes, hilarious dialogue, and only an hour and 10 minutes. Many of the complaints about the film seem to stem from people not realizing exactly what this film is trying to be. Although I've never seen the cartoon, this movie is a perhaps tamed down version of what I imagine the cartoon being like. My friends mentioned how in the cartoon somebody would be charging an energy ball for a 2 or 3 episodes before anything would happen, well that fortunately doesn't happen in this film, but the dialogue, sets, and social situations are all reminiscent of a early 90s cartoon. Take for instance GI Joe. If somebody took the script of one of the episodes and filmed in in live action, the result would probably score a 2/10 on IMDb. The voices and dialogue of many (especially Japanese) cartoons, while great in their own right, don't really work in a live action setting. What this film did is essentially use a cartoon script and put it on film, leading to a charmingly hilarious kids movie. Somebody previously wrote on here that this film seems as if it were written by an 8 year old, well, yeah but that's what makes it great! If I were 8 years old, I can imagine loving this film. As a 22 year old watching it was perhaps the most enjoyable theater experience I've yet had. So my recommendation: grab some alcohol, sneak it into the theater, and get ready for a wonderful time.",Negative
1178,"First of all, I am a DBZ fan. And unlike most of you idiots that want to belittle anything that has to do with dragon ball manga, I take it with a grain of salt. The basic problem with the movie is that no matter how hard you try you can't cram 130 episodes into a 90 min movie. But all of you seem to think that it is possible... right. And, oh yeah, I totally forgot... HOW COULD YOU LEAVE OUT KRILLIN!!!!! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING... I mean it would be so realistic to have a midget playing the strongest human on Earth!(s/n.. for those of you that are just bashing to bash... Krillin is only 3 feet tall) Oh yeah... Yamcha didn't fight...because we all know how much of a fighter he was in DB! No Puar...GEEEZ.. cause a shape shifting cat would be believable. ( I didn't leave out oolong... just felt no need to comment because all he does in DB is try to scare Goku... and then promplty gets his a$$ whipped) Although I could go on for hours about how retarded everyone of you are (knowing you will own the DVD) My real point is... IT IS WHAT IT IS... you spent your money to go see it... and there will be a sequel, and you will go see it.. because we are human and curious.. so before you start an internet petition.. don't be gay sparky! Don't be Gay! For the review.... its an adapted movie that fanboys will hate.. because.. they're fanboys... for the rest of the world... its a movie.. you will like it or you won't, End of story.

1179,"Dragonball Evolution is a comical movie. Surprisingly, it made me laugh a lot. The acting was alright, and the story was so messy. A lot of the time I was completely confused at what was happening. Plus, I was not expecting to see Emmy Rossum. The only thing that kept me watching was the action. It was so amazing! I loved the fight scene with Jamie Chung and herself. It was choreographed really well. Yet, this movie in no way reminds me of Dragonball. I have never watched it, but I've seen pictures and some videos.

Anybody, and i mean ANYBODY who appreciated dragon ball despises this movie. and for good reason too. its terrible. The characters are not anything like the show, vital things about everyone were changed, AND BULMA'S HAIR WASN'T EVEN BLUE! Even if you have never seen an episode of dragon ball z this movie would still be the worst one you'd ever see. The director was an absolute idiot and this piece of crap has forever scarred the name of Dragon Ball. Our fan base has a saying nowadays. ""A true DB fan respects ALL of the series, but still hates Dragon Ball Evolution with a passion."" Do. Not. Watch. This. Movie.",Negative
1182,"I cannot believe that anyone who was involved with this movie has ever even seen the entire Dragonball series. First of all, why is Goku some white kid with gelled hair? They couldn't find anyone that fit that part better? really? and second, I would really like to know why they completely ruined the plot. Why did Master Roshi live in the middle of the city? why did Bulma not have all blue hair? why was Yamcha not afraid of woman? why why why did they make this movie? there are so many things that they completely ignored that could have been so easily fixed. There was no need to change the storyline that much, that is why we all loved it in the first place, the original effing storyline! I am so angry that this movie even exists. I think they should release a personal apology to all the fans of the original anime. I could have written a better screenplay in my sleep.",Negative
1183,First ever review and I waste it on the worst movie Hollywood ever produced.Thanks for the honour.If I could rate this movie a zero I would have done that but unfortunately IMDB is too kind and do not allow 0 ratings.I've seen over 1000+ movies and this is by far the worst.Challenge me!,Negative
1184,"I was at the movie theater trying to figure out which of the new releases to see. I saw the poster for Dragonball Evolution, and it had Chow Yun-Fat's face on it. That tipped the scales and I paid my money and took my chances.The movie starts with the traditional martial arts theme of an old master beating up on a young student. Actually it started with a slow motion zoomed in picture of a guy sweating, then the old guy beat him up.From there it was kind of downhill, but super funny at the same time. In many ways it reminded me of watching the power rangers shows (which came out when I was in college). A bunch of pretty people, acting incredibly earnestly, but coming across as funny instead.In terms of quality, the high point was the first scene with Chow Yun-Fat. He has the kind of physical charisma that is utterly captivating. Later, at the cinematic denouement, instead of captivating the audience, the audience broke out laughing.The problem with the movie, was there wasn't a clear audience in mind (except obvious fans of Dragonball). There were scenes which clearly had more adult audiences in mind (nothing explicit, but some innuendo), but the overall maturity level of the rest of the script was for elementary school students. With enough high school angst thrown in to try to appeal to the young teens.All that being said, most of the people left the movie in good spirits. Not because the movie was good, but because they had a good laugh.",Negative

1186,"To me personally Dragon Ball Evolution was a pretty fine movie despite its flaws, if taking it as a standalone movie based on Dragon ball concept, characters and elements. Due to backlash, it received we end up missing out on more DB live action movies for better or worse. Some major influencers set the pace & trend of hating it usually under pressure of and to appease loud & proud haters and other people followed, just hating it for the sake of hating it like NPC sheeps one after another. It wasn't widely hated when it first came out but haters won eventually and shaped the opinions of everyone else.",Negative
1187,"Here is the original I mean really people, the original wasn't all that great. http://www.onemanga.com/Dragon_Ball/1/11/ It was the fact that it was in your own personal world that you opened up to it in the first place. In all honesty the last movie i saw was twilight. So with that in mind, the acting was great. Hollywood actors usually don't get into there 'powers' in these types of movies. Although Piccollo did look a little funny, but he was borderline. The tone was silly and mischievous, the same as dragonball. If you didn't like it than go read a few chapters of the one above and write a review on that.",Negative
1188,"I don't know where to even begin explaining how much of an embarrassment this movie is to a classic manga and anime, but I'll start with the things I hated least of all; Goku in high school, letting the stupid kids label him as a geek when he could have ripped them all a new anus without even trying, and getting Chichi to like him; not a wise choice for the plot line, but I suppose some changes to the story need to be made so it doesn't look like a carbon copy of the anime. Also, since Goku was always portrayed as an ""oriental"" character, that would mean he would look Asian.They chose a Caucasian actor for the film, and a lame, weak actor I might add; Justin Chatwin has little or no experience in acting, and should not have been chosen for the role of such a big character. In fact, all of the actors did poorly. Their dialogue was corny, and, like Chatwin's acting, lacked a good sense of drama. They also did a poor job on Goku's hair; it looks like they dumped a glob of hair gel on his head and molded it around. They didn't even bother spiking it up. Then there was Piccolo's design; he looked like The Mask, except with pointy ears, and his outfit looked so ridiculous and derivative; a design that's been seen in Star Trek so many times. Also, Goku has no tail. He needs the tail to be able to transform into the Oozaru. And he transformed at the eclipse; he's supposed to transform at the sight of a full moon. When he embraced the Oozaru within him, it had a repulsive lack of drama. The special effects were clearly on a low budget, and they couldn't even afford to set up fans in the scene so, for example, when someone charges up an energy ball, wind blows all around them to enhance the effect. Krillin's absence doesn't do much good either; how else is Goku able to unlock his super saiyan power without the ""pain of loss""? The worst part of the entire movie was the final battle between Goku and Piccolo. Goku's ""kamehameha"" cry was also very weak and dry, and instead of a beam struggle between Goku and Piccolo, Goku used his beam to fly at Piccolo and punch him out. Let's not forget Shenron's design; he looked like a stubby western dragon; Shenron was always an eastern snake dragon. But there were still some good things; such as when Bulma first introduced the capsules her family invented, and activated the capsule, instead of appearing in an exploding cloud of dust, it transformed into a bike; that was pretty cool. And even though Master Roshi clearly wasn't as old here as he was in the original anime, he still maintained his ""dirty old man"" persona. Unfortunately, those don't change a thing about my opinion on this movie; If James Wong even dares to make a sequel, somebody please call his hit.The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 out of ten is because they got the names right!",Negative
1189,"The 2009 movies is destroy the childhood of those fans.

Year pass and I came to the realization that this so called ""adaptation film"" is a piece of utter garbage. Heck, maybe worst than The Last Airbender, at least that film has a simple story from the cartoon series. The action is terrible, the visual effects is blend as hell, the only good character in that movie was Master Roshi, everything else is a cliché executed horribly.

1192,"i just saw this movie yesterday because my friends said its awful. so i went watching the anime series of dragon ball again cause i forgot some. the anime was great and funny. uve probably written this a lot of times, but somehow the director managed to screw this one up pretty good.first thing, goku is about 16 years old while in the anime he is about 10 years old, and important, he has a TAIL! Gohan is already dead, but in the movie he's still alive and got killed by piccolo. thats not even that worse, it gives some twist to it thats not to bad. ow, and goku is in school. so far the anime goes, he didn't knew there was more then his grandpa until bulma came.2nd thing, they left out some of the star players in this movie, and made some characters look bad. roshi looks like a complete full. in the anime he is crazy but funny. here he is just and idiot. and where are krillin and tien and tiau zu.also the containment wave, in the movie they needed some sort of special containment box-thingy. in the anime a bottle was good enough, as long as u could close it. and whats with this eclipse? goku could turn into a big ape every full moon what strange enough happened a couple time in this movie. also when he is in the ape form, he can not be controlled what he surprisingly could in this movie.next is that he was in love with chi-chi, what also seemed a bit weird in the beginning, and got worse during the movie. DB(not Z or GT) isn't a love story, with a lot of romance between those 2 until the end where they marry. its also a pity they didn't brought the ox-king in this movie ( the father of chi-chi ), cause that is one of the funniest characters in the anime if he is in.last the Kamehameha-wave and shen long. I'm not sure how a Kamehameha-wave can bring someone back to life with it destructive power, but OK. goku has to live, how ever if was weird that he was almost killed by 1 single gun shot. in the anime bulma shot him between the eyes and all goku had was pain. but OK. and the way to do the wave was also a bit strange.the dragon was just a big disappointment. from all the special effects, which some were still OK, i hoped this would be the movie's big final. but how a complete waste. the dragon was so freaking small, and yellow-gold-like. and he didn't freaking talk. he should have been long, and rolled in a wide circle, and be freaking green with gold-yellow spike-thingy's on the back. and his voice must be also there. he looks impressive in the anime, but here he just doesn't do it.the only reason i gave this movie 3 stars is because some effects were nice, and i liked some fighting scenes.probably a bit late, but don't go to this movie if u haven't done it so far.",Negative
1193,"I think the movie was both good and bad.I agree that the storyline shouldn't have been changed.I know that it's very extremely long, but the anime has lots of plots that did not affect that much the evolution of the story till the point he fought Piccolo.That part could have been made maybe into the first ten minutes, showing more scenes but with connections between them.Unfortunately there were too many American aspects to a movie adaptation of an anime.I consider that the movie would have done great if we could have seen the cartoon scenes recreated with state of the art visual effects.For those who didn't watch the anime, i can say that it's not a bad movie.The storyline is solid, but don't believe what you see.In the Dragonball universe,things happen differently, better, original...",Negative
1194,"This movie has got to be one of the best adaptations of an anime ever. OK so Justin isn't that great of an actor, he still succeeds as a teenage Goku, and his hair is fine. Imagine an actor wearing a giant spiky mess of hair, it just would look too goofy, I'm glad with the way they went with it. Bulma was definitely bulma, Chi-Chi was a little off (missing her anger issues), and Yamcha was kind of lame. But Roshi was the Roshi we all remember, minus being balled. If you nitpick this movie then yes you will be angry, but if you look at the movie from a technical side compared to other anime movies, this owns. I recommend seeing it, and I cannot wait for DBZ.",Negative
1195,"First of all, This movie was made for fans of the series, so if you aren't one, then obviously you're not going to enjoy this fairly campy adaption of an old anime series. If we all remember that this movie IS indeed a kids film, then you should obviously not expect great cinema, but innocent fun, which is exactly what the film is.The violence is fairly mild (but very well choreographed), the effects are sub-par and the acting is laughable, but I didn't mind all of that because this was a new interpretation of a series that I loved as a kid, and all the core ideas and themes from the show are still here.If you can suspend your disbelief and forget about certain large plot holes, you'll have a lot of fun with this movie. If you can't do that, then don't bother because, make no mistake, this is FAR from a good film.",Negative
1196,"It is actually quite astonishing that the movie has literally nothing to offer, I mean, after all, it is based on Dragonball, it must have been really hard to eradicate every aspect of it's awesomeness while filling the hole with so much stupid crap. Further on conversation challenges C movie flicks like Comodo vs. Cobra, the story is bogus, unmotivated actors behave like wind-up dolls, the action is totally lame and forget about the rest too.Questions, like how could this happen and so on are probably already answered and in the end this is just one of the worse movies of all time and will be forgotten forever soon.It could have been worse though. It could have been somewhat better, feature one or two elements of the anime, pleasing one or the other kid. It could have been making money, encouraging the producers to do sequels and so on. But now we have the chance, that somewhere in the future someone will come along and do a reboot. And that one will probably be an interesting piece as it will really need to deliver. Maybe the producers will even hire a good director. Let's look forward to that and just not talk about this ever again.0/10",Negative

The result wasn't incredible, but in the end I found this movie watchable. Of course as the big fan I am, I found it awful. They butchered almost every good thing from the anime. They didn't include Krilin, Picoro was ugly (He was ugly in the series as well, but in a different, positive way) and Goku went to school. It is so loosely based on the original series that they can be considered as two unrelated and independent (Except for names) pieces of work.It was so clichéd filled and the acting was terrible. The product is an extremely forgettable movie for casual goers and insult for fans. But I liked it despite its flaws. Perhaps it is because I never thought of this as a serious Dragon Ball project, therefore I exclude this title from Toriyama's work.Before my conclusion I must mention the mighty Kame Hame Ha. What happened to it? It was a pretty decent technique in the series and games. But here is just some laughable thing that only serves to put out some candles, or cure diseases.I am really picky when it comes to movies, but this one might be the exception. I don't recommend this to anyone though.",Negative

1202,"Hey folks, 3.3/10 is definitely not what this movie deserves. What do you wish to see in an adaptation of anime or comics on big screen? Just the characters coming to life? That is the case with watchmen and i can see how highly it scores credited to the 2 and half hour long frustrating plot all the while sticking to the source material. Dragonball evolution was discarded by fans because they can't get over a notion that a live adaptation of the best anime ever is impossible. It certainly isn't dark and wily as the dark knight. Rather the movie focuses on high paced action sequence with humor that was the flavor of the anime. Where the movie loses is its very short runtime, average cinematography, and a short and average end fight sequence, when the first few action scenes seemed so promising. Chatwin does a fair portrayal of the cheesy, innocent hero Goku (when was it said he is Asian anyway in the anime?). And about that whole goku going to school thing, doesn't gohan go to school later in the anime? So what's the harm in making some improvisations, otherwise what would be the point of watching something that you know everything about. Roshi's character is just as colorful as in the anime. With some better cgi effects, the movie could really have been awesome. Give it a try with an open mind and without any notions, guys.",Negative
1203,"what i don't understand is have you people even watched the series? I used to make everyone for and hour a day leave me the hell alone! i wasn't going to listen anyway. the series was based on b-rated acting for comical effect. master Roshi was a bit out of his mind and that's what makes him master Roshi. Goku was a bit shy and did stumble on himself and Bulma was always acting like a cross between 007 and Lara croft? I didn't like the portrayal of Yamcha though. He didn't have hair for one It seems to me that the people that were really into this movie took into account that this movie was based on a kids show and therefore understood the value of portraying the characters as they should. Kinda cheesy. And as for the martial arts, Goku wasn't supposed to be the master in DBZ! he hasn't even heard of going super-saiyen, or met Vegeta yet.. the character of master Roshi was in crouching tiger hidden dragon so i know he knew martial arts. why don't u watch an episode of the series then watch the movie and compare it then. I know you'll find a lot more similarities with a little refresher of the show.

It was a great movie, the acting was good, the effects were great, the costumes were amazing, and the changes were enough to make the story interesting to someone who's read the manga and seen the anime (like me). A direct adaption would have been boring. This version changed stuff around and made it work. While it's true it could have used a few more characters from the original stuff, that still seems like a fairly minor complaint, as more characters would just mean they'd have to introduce them, which would bog down the movie. And to the people who complain about hair color, what works in animation doesn't always work in live action, and that's a REALLY minor thing to complain about.",Negative

I really liked how the characters were portrayed, Goku was great, he plays a high schooler with chi chi. Throughout the entire film they both have a love connection between each other. My favorite character was Piccolo, The actor portraying him did a great job. Bulma plays a tough fearless character, really well too. Yamcha was good, master Roshi was great, and so was Gohan. The story is basic, Goku comes home only to find that his grandpa was killed, Goku then realises he must collect all 7 dragonballs before the eclipse. But in order to do that, he must defeat Oozaru and then defeat Piccolo. The effects were really good, the acting is phenomenal, the story was great, and the character development was really good.

1207,"All around I found it to be a Really Creative and Clever take on the story, and even an improvement in a few aspects, like joining Martian and Piccolo into one character.I would have changed a few things though: 1. the ending a tiny bit, to make it more similar to DB (I would have had them revive a dead Yamcha instead, for example; and not have the flying Goku by the end, but a powerful well rooted KameHameHa instead); 2. the whole concept of having Goku be the old minion of Piccolo makes no sense at all... it would make Goku older than 2000 year old!, and Goku's grandfather too... It would have been better to have Piccolo explain that his old minion died but that Goku seems to be the same kind of monstrosity, so that hell become the new minion of Piccolo;I really enjoyed it anyway!!",Negative
1208,First of all not as bad. as I thought it would be I actually waited an entire year before finally watching it. I am a huge fan of dragonball and dragonball Z and from beginning to end of this movie it brought me back to the original characters and series that I loved. I wish it had more fight scenes with powers but they did a good job putting everything together. Also the plot followed the series well with only a few minor changes. Overall this movie was highly enjoyable and I look forward to a possible sequel. You can tell the director really watched the show and enjoyed it each character in the movie have the same essence as the cartoon characters.,Negative
1209,"I saw a trailer of this film and i thought it looked brilliant, and when i watched it it was brilliant, it was full of action from start to end and i think the actors portrayed the characters very well. If anyone says this film is crap they have no sense. I don't see why people have to be so picky with how the characters look, This is supposed to be a bit different and it is and it does it well. I also thought the special effects were awesome. It really is a great adaptation of the manga series. I can't wait for the sequel to this film. It will be brilliant. My mum also enjoyed the film as much as i did. Some people can be hard to please.",Negative
1210,"This movie exceeded my expectations completely. I never thought that they would be able to cram that much info into practically 80 minutes. They did a great job. Sure the script was a little bad and Yaumcha was kind of not we expected but it felt like a DragonBall movie. ~Spoiler~ Goku going to school and actually living somewhat of a normal life was a unique and gutsy approach to the intro of the movie but I think it fit nicely. Chi Chi still lived in a castle yet it looked like it was in the suburbs and Roshi lived in the city but at least it was something different.~/spoiler~Everyone who complains about how you should never see this movie should just not talk. Being closed minded really doesn't help and it really shows how ignorant people can be.Sure it may not follow the story at all, but its still a DragonBall movie no matter what. As I recall The Tree of might doesn't fit into the DragonBall plot either so let it go. Justin Chatwin was an amazing actor as Goku. I'm glad they chose him then say someone like Justin Timberlake or Jon Heder. He fits the profile well. Before I even watched the movie I told myself. Its not going to fit into the series so just keep an open mind. I did and I enjoyed it. I think the Final battle could have been longer but it was still very good. One thing I didn't like. The clothing for Goku. The pants for his uniform could have been tighter as they went down. -FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT- See it. Keep and open mind and enjoy the movie. Thats all I have. Thanks for reading my review, its my first one.",Negative
1211,I enjoyed watching this film saw it at the cinema 4 times and got it on DVD and still watch it now yer it isn't as great as manga but be realistic people there is no technology on earth that could simulate that sort image I think that did good with this film and i hope they bring out a squeal cause i will be going to the cinema to see it and get it on DVD as I enjoy these sort of movies and the first one was not disappointing in my eyes all you manga fans have to put that aside when you was the actual movie anyway enough please bring out a number 2 as im a big dbz fan which I heard they were making squeal but I have searched and searched and found nothing to confirm this .,Negative
1212,"Dragonball Evolution - Am I horrified, when it comes to this film? I think not. But what I am horrified about, are all of the so-called 'Dragonball fans' who are talking like idiots, about a film that is exceptionally great. Do you know how stupid you sound when you post something like 'Bulma would have been better if her hair were blue?' or 'Justin Chatwin is going to suck as Goku, because he doesn't look like him'.Yeah, okay - He doesn't look like an animated character. Don't be stupid. You all are finding the dumbest reasons to hate this title. It's either because .. 1) This movie didn't follow closely to the original storyline. 2) Characters didn't look EXACTLY LIKE the originals. 3) Some scene had ""bad"" special effects. You have to give an amount of 'Leeway' for this film - as like other films, none are perfect.I find the actors' performances were at their best, and the action scenes were awesome. I and other Dragonball fans enjoyed the efforts of the film's creators/staff. Yeah, the movie had its faults - but for the most part, this flic is a blast.",Negative
1213,this was a great adaption. its not exactly like anime but if it was it wouldn't have worked. and for all those people saying that it ruined there childhood and goku was never a teenager how could they do this to dragon ball z. 1st this did not ruin your childhood DB Z is still DB Z there not going to go back and change it to look like this if you want DB Z go buy the DVD. 2nd goku was a teenager he was 14 when the comic started and had to be like 16 17 when he battled piccolo and no he didn't go to school but gohan did i have a feeling there trying to mix the two i don't think there going to put gohan in the movie. 3rd THIS IS NOT DRAGON BALL Z ITS DRAGONBALL people are getting angry that it doesn't have enough action and all goku dose is train. he doesn't train that much if you ever read the comic goku trains almost every episode there wasn't a whole lot of action in dragon ball it wast until Dragon ball z where we saw the intense earth busting battles. over all great movie go see it don't download it,Negative
1214,"I had seen the trailers and was not impressed, and only went to see it because James Marsters was Piccolo and surprise, surprise I LOVED the movie. Going to go see it again and have preordered the DVD. I had seen some of the TV series, but on the big screen with real actors was awesome. Don't follow the sheep that were bad mouthing this movie before it ever came out, go see it and form your own opinion, it has lots of action, never bogs down and the story moves quickly. James is excellent as Piccolo, of course being a big fan of his I would have like to see more of him, but he is all the way through the movie, in fact all the actors gave top notch performances. James IS Piccolo, just like he is Spike, he has made this character his and what fun that is.",Negative
1215,"OK, I get it.The guy who plays Goku isn't Japanese. And the girl who plays Bulma doesn't have blue hair. And the guy who plays Yamcha has a dye job. And there's no Krillin. And Goku's not a kid. And Piccolo doesn't have his green antennae. And they're in high school. And Roshi isn't a creepy perv. But here's the thing: CALM DOWN.Dragonball , the series, is incredible, not to mention complex. And a cartoon. To make a movie out of it, they had to trim some stuff.So, Dragonball Evolution isn't a perfect replica of the series. But it does it's best to stay true to the material and the characters.If you're looking for the exact, spot-on, down to the last detail movie about young Goku and his search for the dragonballs ... you'll be disappointed.But if you want to sit back, relax, and open your mind to this interpretation, I think you'll find it enjoyable.",Negative
1216,"Oh my goodness! I could not believe my luck when I saw they were making this movie. I nearly wet myself. I have followed this series since day one and I am a die hard Otaku. It was so like the anime. Word from word in some parts. The likeness of the characters were spot on. I would recommend this for generations to come as a overall anime/reality classic. It's even better than the anime. I don't want to tell you anything about the movie but I believe me, me and all my ho mies loved it. Goku is super hot. :) Just like the cartoon!!! I loved the love story they incorportated into it. It made me misty eyed. MUST GO SEE IT! 10000000000 stars!!!!!!",Negative
1217,"Unlike all the other small minded individuals that have given this movie 3's and below, I was able to use my brilliance to see the true genius of this film. Any one who can't appreciate this movie probably doesn't have a high school degree. Although this movie did not follow the cartoon at all, it didn't need to because it was so good. It was called evolution for a reason because when things evolve they get better, just like this movie. The depiction of piccolo was the greatest character study ever, hands down, don't argue. This was better than Heath Ledger as the Joker and even Toby McGuire as spaceman. Hopefully people will be able to pull their heads out of their behinds and appreciate this great vision for what it really is. As an up and coming film maker myself, I am using this great flick as the foundation of my own movie making. Therefore, the film has been life changing. Goku is awesome, and deserves an Oscar nod. I really hope Fox is smart enough to green light a sequel, I think we could have the next great saga on our hands. This could be bigger than Star Wars and Rocky put together.Final thoughts - WOW",Negative
1218,"From a fans standpoint, the movie is obviously full of hacked parts that neither fit nor coincide with the actual manga or anime. The story should've been split into three parts. almost like a trilogy, and put together from there. It moves along too fast for any person that has not seen the series to understand. I was disappointed because my wife could not enjoy the show because she didn't know what was happening.Now, in hindsight and while I was watching it, I totally enjoyed the show. I am going to buy it because I want to see the story continue. I also hope that the director actually reads the story a ""little"" more before he rips up the storyline and puts it back together, forgetting some of the pieces in the process. However, he did do a great job of making it work. I couldn't of done that much or gotten that far into the story with such a short period of time.Anyway, Im happy I saw it and had fun watching it. It shouldve been more zany and crazier and full of funny parts, but I enjoyed it anyway! Hooray! Now time for the second, and better, one.",Negative
1219,"Am I the only one here who actually LOVED this movie?! Okay, I have watched this show ever since it came to TV. I have seen the Dragonball series at LEAST three times and Dragonballz at least 6. I know what I am talking about. Yes, I agree, it has some faults and some lame spots, but let's pretend we are the ages we were when the show came out. The effects would have been GREAT, we would not care about the acting or who was cast, we would have just thought it was FANTASTIC! Now, I am 21 years old and grew up with Dragonball mania. I admit, when the trailer came out I thought, oh my gosh, they modernized it and Justin Chatwin is Goku...oh no! I saw the movie tonight and LOVED it. I ignored the effect issues and the lame dialogue and character portrayal, but as I was mildly surprised at the differences in character, I LOVED the changes. Bulma, for instance was not whiney and a chicken, she was a kick ass chick. Chi Chi WAS too sappy for my taste and I like her DragonballZ character more. These are just a few examples, but I LOVED the movie, minus the Hollywood-ization HA!",Negative
1220,"Let's get one thing straight: Dragonball Evolution is one of the worst movies ever made, and if you think otherwise, you must be living in a fantasy world. This film is a colossal disaster that insults the beloved franchise and its fans. Seriously, how did anyone think this was a good idea?First off, the plot is a nonsensical mess. It feels like the writers threw darts at a board of ideas and hoped for the best. Are we really expected to believe that a bunch of random high school drama can replace the rich lore of the original series? If you think this movie did justice to Dragon Ball, you clearly have no understanding of storytelling. The characters are reduced to caricatures-Goku is an awkward teenager instead of the powerful warrior fans adore. What a joke!And let's talk about the visuals. Sure, there are some flashy effects, but they feel more like a cheap knockoff than the iconic battles we know and love. If stunning visuals are all you need to enjoy a film, then I guess you'd be happy watching paint dry. The fight scenes are laughable at best, lacking any real choreography or excitement. It's almost as if the filmmakers didn't even bother to study what made the anime so engaging.Then there's the complete disregard for the source material. The filmmakers had one job-to honor the legacy of Dragon Ball-and they utterly failed. If you think this movie captures the essence of the franchise, then you must not care about quality storytelling at all. It's a disgrace that should have never seen the light of day.In conclusion, Dragonball Evolution is not just a bad movie; it's an insult to fans everywhere. If you're a true fan of Dragon Ball, you owe it to yourself to skip this abomination. It's time to face the facts: this film is a trainwreck that should be buried and forgotten, and anyone who claims otherwise needs to take a good, hard look in the mirror.",Negative
1221,"The movie is so cursed that it made Akira start writing again, good job!Ok but also, the movie is a lot of misinformation in one single place, with all the confusion it can physically contain, BUT if you consider this movie a big parody it is kind of funny in a twisted way, almost like a trash comedy film.So yeah, as a Dragon Ball fan I cannot give it a low rating because it made Akira literally pick up the series, not even kidding, and also as an anime fan in general, this really made producers think twice before picking up an anime to adapt into live action, later movies still made some mistakes, but they are still an EVOLUTION from this.",Negative
1222,"Imagine a completely Mediterranean-winning genetic high school drama movie before the second half wizard introduces.

1223,"Well... what is done is done... I'm fans of dragonballs series since I was a kid, I've followed the stories from comics to anime...when I saw this ""Evolution"" rumors its just like a dream come true for me... after long waiting finally Hollywood make it into a big screen movie... and then couple of month later woalah... the movie is play..I watch this with my other dragonball addicted friends... after we saw middle of the movie we decide to get out from theater without finishing watch the movie... and we playing PS-one dragonball game instead... that thing makes us forget for a moment we've been disappointed by dragonball ""Evolution"" We hope there is another big screen of dragonball and we hope the other time is we watch it we all dragonball fans can have a nice dream in bed.. and not a nightmare... thank you...thank you... thank you...Thank you to a new TV series of dragonball named ""DragonBall KAI"" that remastered version is PERFECT... so we also can forgot the ""Evolution""... Phew.. what a relief...",Negative
1224,"Well, quickly, I hope Fox sees the huge reaction this has gotten, even if negative. It shows the number of fans who LOVE this series, EVEN AFTER THIS DISASTER, and their level of enthusiasm for the franchise across all cultures and ages (I never got into anime and comics, maybe I was a weird kid, but this series turned me around at age 22-23. It was for this show ONLY, still couldn't get into other anime, they all seemed to suck compared to Dragonball to me). When I'd get home from work, couldn't help but to watch the recording and follow the story, hell, we'd watch this as adults AT work during breaks, all races/ages... love it's depth, the characterizations of the characters etc., such a beautiful story, even if a cartoon, in an ugly world... the lead up the fighting, then the fights, ridiculous). So if Fox is smart, I hope they see the potential of what a movie about Dragonball Z done right could be... along par with Star Wars and Avatar, I mean.Now the adult in me thinks this... and I challenge my fellow DB and DBZ fans to answer this... how would you make it as cool as Star Wars or Avatar? Do you go with the 3 foot hair for Goku? A poof of smoke for capsule corp cars? Jurassic Park like flying dragons? You know what, I say yeah to almost all that except maybe tone down Goku's hair. Avatar had allot of fantasy but indoctrinated real/believable characters like the scientist and soldiers into the movie and fantasy. The tree near the end was awesome, they could have a huge dragon, with a dark sky and lightning right after being a real life sort of setting, and had us buying it.I think Fox just didn't have the balls to risk kids who maybe did not grow up on the show (though I am seeing many have in the constant reruns) liking a movie they thought they could not relate to, being too weird, but a great story is a great story, great characters, story of good vs evil etc will always stand the test of time... and too many older folk would have buoyed a good adaptation as well.Movie needs to be long or a trilogy too, along lines of LOTR and Harry Potter.OK, geek out, back to the real world. Just do it FOX people./rant",Negative
1225,I would rather let someone curry fart in my face than watch this abysmal pice of trash ever again,Negative
1226,"I regret wanting to watch this movie when I was younger. Since I watched it more, I came to conlusion that this movie is corny in many ways:
1. Goku being an angsty teen is unfitting and this would fit Gohan more. Minust angsty part.2. Special effects are awful
3. Voice acting is boring.4. Writing in general gives me gonorrhea.Just watching the rest of the movie feels like MKUltra psyop done by people who want to experiment on others to see their breaking point.If you want to check out Dragon Ball franchise, just read mangas or watch anime.Avoid this at any cost. I am too bored to give this movie a rating.",Negative
1227,"Dragonball Evolution may be the most hated movie that came out in 2009. Having been a huge dragon ball fan since the age of nine I find it easy to see why. Still, I'll try to review this movie as honest as I can.What made Dragonball so good in the first place? The gigantic fights, the combination of fantasy and science-fiction and the characters are just a few reasons. But for me, it's because dragon ball is one big adventure.This is a basic rule that is instantly broken in this movie: Goku is in high school. This may sound ridiculous to newcomers, but the truth is, you just can't do that and expect fans to take it. Goku never goes to school! He was raised in the woods, meets all sort of fantastic friends and grows up fighting and seeing all kinds of sights. That's the basic rule and so this movie destroys one of my greatest childhood daydreams: never having to go to school.Not only is he in school, but he's an 'outsider' that has a crush on the popular girl (Ch-Chi, who in the original manga was very shy,becomes miss perfect). Can it be more cliché? It couldn't possibly stray further away from the original material. The creators of this mess didn't understand dragon ball. Apart from the high school part, the movie fails to even remotely resemble dragon ball. Goku is a completely different character, Chi-Chi is, Yamucha is, Mai is there for sex-appeal (a clumsy girl in the original) and Piccolo doesn't have any characterization. I understand that it's not easy to make manga characters live-action, but seriously, they break too many ground rules here. Some characters do resemble their original counterparts (like Bulma and muten Roshi), but that can't make up for the fact that they left out Kuririn.I read that they put in as few characters as possible, but leaving out Kuririn is impossible. Especially if you decide to make piccolo the enemy. In the anime *spoiler alert* Kuririn is the first one to die from piccolo. It's a very powerful scene and the first time I thought that Goku was going to cry. It's the first time that the series becomes somewhat darker in tone. *End spoiler* Leaving out Kuririn is like leaving out Ron from Harry Potter. There are, of course, others that they left out (like Tenshinhan), but I do understand that they can't cram everything in one movie, but it's not Dragonball without Kuririn.The rest of the movie does play like an adventure story, but the whole script is just disjointed.There is so much bad dialogue that it will leave the viewer cringing. A lot of things are never explained well and it will leave new viewers scratching their heads. What's up with Piccolo for example? Why is he so evil? I really don't know. It's also impossible to start a dragon ball movie with Piccolo. People seem to forget that before Piccolo we have about 100(!) episodes dealing with other things. Then we're going to start with Piccolo. That is just impossible.Let's talk about the music. Now, her's is an aspect that I actually like about this movie. 'Rule' from Hamasaki isn't that bad. I think that there are better artists in the world but this song is kind of in the right spirit of dragon ball. The regular score also isn't that bad. Not groundbreaking, but just a good score.One absolutely horrid part of this move are the special effects. Now people have complained about the dragonballs (looked just fine to me), Bulma's hair and the Kamehameha. I must say, the mayor consensus is that the Kamehameha doesn't look like a beam. Well, I would prefer it looking more beam-like, but if you overlook that than this is actually the best computer-effect of the whole movie. Unfortunately, shenlon looks horrid (I have seen fans do a much better job than this) and oozaru looks awful. Oozaru looks so bad that I wonder how they even dared to show this to an audience.Then, there's the acting. I feel sort of bad for the actors, since most of them are very talented. Overall, the acting is okay. There is a consensus that Goku has to be Asian. Personally, I don't care. Talent is more important than skin color. I can't really say what I think about Justin Chatwin. He's never able to speak a single line of dialogue that would have been spoken by Goku (here I'm referring to the script). Chi-Chi is fine for me, so is muten Roshi. Frankly, I feel that Emmy Rossum get's the closest to Bulma. She did the best job for me.James Marsters is not in it enough, but he actually manages be like Piccolo. The one actor that should give up on acting is the one that plays Yamucha. Seriously, he can't act. Why did they pick him? I cringed every time he said something. Yamucha is a tough guy with a bad attitude when we first meet him. Here, he's a surfer boy.Acting gets a general 6/10 from me(would have gotten more with a different actor for yamucha).Then, we get to the last part: the fighting. There a few fight scenes in the movie, but they weren't long enough. The first two are the best. But the others can barely be called fighting.Now, how does the movie fare in general? Surprisingly, I do enjoy it sometimes. However, only when I'm in the mood to watch something bad.I don't believe it is the worst movie ever made. It's just too painstakingly bad to watch for a fan like me.Overall: 3,5/10.",Negative
1228,I've had to accept this film for what it is. Not anything like Dragonball. Which this is the point for the evolution subtitle. To show how its changed. I am a very big fan of the original series Dragonball. I understand the reasoning for updating it to be able to bring it to the big screen. But so much just seems wrong. First off look this movie is way too short. It could have easily been a half hour longer. Leaving so many action scenes so heavily cut. Just when you starting to get pumped its over. The movie jumps from scene to scene very quickly. The lead role by Justin Chatwin is fine. I can take him as Goku and James Marsters as Piccolo. Even though he barely shows up in the film every now and again. The special effects are way below what they should have been. Goku's Oozaru form is a mess. The fulum's are as well. The energy blasts are okay...The Volcano scene had its trouble. The soundtrack seems to fit. I liked the composed and Rule theme.It's not that an anime film shouldn't be made. It should just be made well. This was average at best. But yet makes Watchmen look like the holy grail of comic book movies. I'm still a fan of this film anyways because this is all DB fans have. Far as live action goes. I'm excited to see more. It's still a fun ride and something the whole family can watch. I will admit I wish they had given the dragon a voice at the end. Plus the dragon didn't look like the dragon I've seen before. The dragon balls were cool. One other special effect that is acceptable. I'm just not sure James Wong was the right director for such a great story like this. He doesn't seem to have a lot of experience under his belt to take on such a project. I give the film a 6 out of 10. Thats being nice.,Negative
1229,"This film completely fails to understand what made Dragon Ball special in the first place. The characters barely resemble their original versions, the story is simplified to the point of being meaningless, and the tone feels wrong from beginning to end. Even if you forget that it is supposed to be an adaptation, it still doesn't work as a fantasy or action movie. The pacing is weak, the fights are uninspired, and nothing feels memorable. It's not just a bad adaptation, it's a bad movie in general and a huge waste of a beloved franchise.",Negative
1230,"I've got nothing against movie musicals, director Tom Hooper, or even anybody who's a part of making this film. But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.While I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Misérables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.There's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Misérables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.First, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.Next, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.Hooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.The pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.In that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.Cats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.That story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.A little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.Francesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.There's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.As a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.So, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.In short, Cats is an absolute atrocity. From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.There's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible.",Negative
1231,"I can't imagine how much the actors must've been paid to have this in their resume. From Swift to Elba, JHud to Rebel Wilson. Judy Dench, even! No amount of acting talent could save this sorry excuse for a self-indulgent furry fantasy",Negative
1232,"There is a wall in my house. The wall is a simple wall, eight feet tall, and fifteen feet wide, it sits in a corner in the basement. It has been painted beige, with a few coats to cover up the bumps and scratches from coats before. It's got it's idiosyncrasies, the way the light jumps off the paint, the not so even drywalling underneath. Stare at it long enough, and it begins to speak to you - or at least allow you to speak to it. Maybe there's something to the wall - or maybe it's just my romantic illusions of inspiration and contemplation that bring life to it. My point is this - staring at that blank wall for two hours is far more inspiring, interesting and enlightening than watching even just two minutes of the cinematic colonoscopy that is ""Cats.""

1237,"This film is truely a masterpeice in unintentional horror. The effects are so special I'm going to have nightmares for weeks to come. Why they didn't just dress the actors in costumes and makeup I have no idea, either the filmmakers are lazy  or someone wanted to push the boundries of visual effects. Cats pushes those effects right off a cliff into the uncanny valley. The design and look is freakin disgusting.I never saw the stage musical, so I didn't know what I was in for. This movie that has no plot, it's just a bunch of random cats introducing themselves. I tried to enjoy it as a so-bad-it's-good cringefest, but the lack of plot and the terrible effects make it impossible.If you can't even look at the screen without feeling annoyed & disgusted, it's impossible to enjoy it in anyway.Thanks Tom Hooper.",Negative

1250,"I got to get real with you. Before this movie, I had high functioning depression. I tried all the methods of beating it. I took meds, I snorted curry, but nothing would stop it. Then the trailer dropped. It was like the clouds parted. Seeing James Corden as a cat was all I needed. In the days to come, I looped the trailer over and over. I couldn't get enough. When the movie came out, I bought the first ticket, trampled a girl to get in, and sat in the first row. And all my sadness dissipated. It was beautiful. In that moment I had an out of body experience. Seeing Judy Dench lick her leg and watching Taylor Swift being slightly less annoying than usual all combined with James Corden was too much.
I got home that night and threw out all my meds and curry. I didn't need them anymore. Since then I have devoted myself to watching the movie five times a day while sitting on my head. I am the proud owner of so many cats, I lost count. My neighbors think me strange and Dad said something about disowning me, but it matters not. I have all I need. I no longer shower so I can make time for this glorious masterpiece. The sight of Jason Derulo crawling around alone is enough to wash my body clean enough for years. My hair practically cleans itself now. I can only hope you experience this meowsterpiece in the same way I did.

1251,"Cats is incredibly surreal. It's barely a movie, I don't know what it is.Now, don't get me wrong, it was hilarious. The wonky facial expressions, lingering songs, and downright creepy mannerisms were quite the hoot. Almost all of the audience was there to laugh at the movie. For good reason. There were two people in the theater who were taking it seriously (a young couple on a date. Oops, that's a poor choice of movies), but they turned around by the end of the ""film"" and started chuckling.It's so strange how a piece of media like this can exist. Despite how unwatchable it is, the movie was weirdly hypnotizing. Well, I guess we are one with the jellicles now. Whatever that means.",Negative
1252,"Hyped as the worst film of the decade so much that it didnt seem THAT bad while watching. Kind of a reversal of hyping something as amazing only for it to be just ok.The first few songs are quite unorganized and Rebel Wilson's song is disturbing, at least to me.
After Judy dench shows up it gets decently entertaining. The dance number after that is good and the absolute showstopper, was Skimbleshanks The Railway Cat. Jennifer Hudson was Jennifer Hudson. She was good. If the first half was as organized and taken care of as the second half was, it would be much better. McKellen was very good as well.Look, CATS is a hard show to even sell to a stage audience. It's an acquired taste. It's not for everyone. Some parts (cough) Skimbleshanks, were very well done while other parts (sneeze) Rebel Wilson's song were atrocious.",Negative
1253,"I have been a big fan of ""Cats"" over the years and I even have the stage soundtrack on my USB stick to play in the car. In 1998 they released a filmed a stage version, masterfully performed, but with cameras set up from various points to get both full, wide shots and very intimate close-up shots. There is no audience applause at all, so it was probably filmed only with the cast and crew present. To me that is the definitive film version, a real ""10 of 10"" for fans of the musical.With that as a background I watched this new movie version last night on BluRay from my local library. While it is not nearly as bad as many are rating it (as of today it has 48% votes of ""1"") I found it to be a bit too cheesy I suppose in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience. Inclusion of such famous personalities as Rebel Wilson and James Corden to play overweight cats in attempts at humor didn't work at all. And Taylor Swift, bless her little heart, just isn't a good enough singer to do the solo number assigned to her character.So, while much of it was entertaining, and I loved the extended tap-dancing scene along the rail tracks, overall it is just a shadow of the properly done stage musical. The attempts to scale it up to include a broader set of London locations just doesn't work very well.Surprisingly, Ian McKellen, who isn't known for his singing, is actually very good as Gus the Theater Cat. I like Jennifer Hudson, a gifted singer, but in her attempt ""to make it her own"" just didn't come over well singing ""Memory."" Elaine Paige did it on stage so much better and once you have seen and heard that then the other versions just don't compare.And finally Francesca Hayward, a ballerina, has the role of Victoria, a discarded cat new to the Jellicle Ball and who serves as narrator. She has a couple of songs and while she doesn't have a powerful stage singing voice she actually was better than some of the ""personalities"" that were added to the cast to help draw viewers.So, I'm glad I watched it, as a fan of the ""Cats"" stage musical it was fun to see a somewhat different take on the story, and the extras on the disc are interesting, but overall this is probably a movie that should not have been made.",Negative
1254,"I'm currently listening to the original sound track to try and cleanse myself of the 'film' I just saw. It was equal parts a bland tedious trudge to get through, and a confusing horrifically misjudged spectacle of disaster. The tone was all over the place. James Corden got some laughs almost purely from the way he seemed to be embarrassed to be in the picture. Jennifer Hudson's melodramatic hysterics were more cringe inducing than genuinely emotional. Sweeping epic songs are visualised in the most bland and ugly way possible.
I spent the whole film feeling frustrated at seeing a bunch of songs I like being butchered. Constantly interrupting the flow of a song to simply 'say' a line as opposed to 'singing' it isn't edgy, it's just worse.
The whole thing is so misguided that I'm sure even the on set catering was mucked up somehow.",Negative

1256,"The reviews are right this time. The cast does its job just fine. The songs and dances are well performed. It's a shame, because I feel terrible for the cast. It's not their fault. I don't think they knew what visual effects were going to be applied with CGI in post.This film is unintentionally one of the greatest horror movies ever made, worthy of recognition alongside The Exorcist. You are that uncomfortable as you sit through it.Whoever gave the final go-ahead to make the cats look the way they look does not know what cats or people look like. The characters do not look quite feline enough and do not look quite human enough. They fall into a gray area somewhere in between and we call this ""the uncanny valley."" This movie is more horrifying than ""It: Chapter 1"" if you are a coulrophobe.I would rather it were ""Spiders."" You would at least know what you're getting into then and I cannot stand spiders.The most nightmarish moments are after certain songs when the cats start meowing or lapping milk and water out of bowls. I felt like the Nazis at the end of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" I thought my face was going to melt off.My friends and I went to it after laughing at all the bad reviews because we wanted to make fun of it, but it's so visually horrid that it held us tight in its Uncanny Valley grip for the whole of its two hours. Who in the production department looked at the finished computer generation of the cats' appearances and said, ""That looks good. Let's go with that!""?If you go, DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN. This movie will horrify them far more than anything Pennywise the Clown could come up with.",Negative

1259,"I really don't know why this film is getting so much hate. It's a fun piece of whimsy based on the hugely successful stage play of the same name.
Tom Hooper has put together a star studded cast, created a coherent plot that links together the various musical pieces and it's a great experience.
It starts off slowly but once it kicks into high gear, it's mesmerising through to the end. Just like the stage play it makes little sense, street cats gather to perform for the old matriarch Queen cat. She will decide which of them deserves to be elevated to a new life. Makes no sense but neither do cats in real life.
The effects are great and yes they are cat people, THAT'S THE STAGE PLAY TOO!!! In a world where we are happy to have Bradley Cooper voice a humanoid Racoon but we freak out about people looking like cats then I have to suspect all the fuss and negativity surrounding this is just false offence.
It's not got a huge amount of replay value but it was great and definitely worth catching on the big screen. Francesca Hayward was fantastic as Victoria, her dancing is incredible, Idris Elba was menacing as Macavity Jennifer Lawrence has some serious pipes. For me, one of the standout performances was Robert Fairchild as Munkustrap.
Does it say anything about our humanity? Does it have a deep rooted message that will change you? No.
Does it showcase the weirdness and self indulgence that your household cat, sitting across the room from you, quietly judging you, displays on a daily basis? Yes.",Negative

Yes it's weird, and at times boring because the songs just keep bleeding into each other, but overall its an entertaining spectacle that kids will like. Not nearly as bad as people have been saying.

A couple days later I watched it again with a new appreciation and loved it.",Negative

I loved the 2 leads, Victoria & Munkustrap, who's faces & dancing were captivating to watch. Jennifer Hudson's singing made me cry, it was so well done. I thought the cgi was actually pretty cool & amazing. The only actor bit I didn't like was Taylor Swift. Yeech, she was bad. It was like she didn't even try to move like a cat. Don't know why some reviewers slammed that the plot made no sense. The plot was actually very clear. The move kept me entertained.",Negative

It's like the cinematic equivalent of the Tide pod challenge. Many in the theater could not take it and left. Those of us who stayed only succeeded in poisoning themselves. Not much of an accomplishment. I found myself angry-angry at the people who made it, angry at the people who distributed it. It is an indictment of capitalism that someone can sell something this bad and not face imprisonment.",Negative

An amazing wife, 2 beautiful children and... I'm sorry but this is so hard to write... a cat. I thought despite the bad reviews and creepy previews that I could still find some joy in this movie as I have been able to find joy in many things in my life. However, I got ten minutes into the movie and my body wouldn't let me get up out of the chair, I was paralyzed as the horrible images, ear destroying songs, and dialogue that seemed to be written by a mentally challenged dodo bird was forced upon me. It has been several days since I left that theatre and I will not go into specific details, but my actions have lead to my family leaving me and my cat no longer being with us. Something has taken over my mind that I never though possible, there is such anger filling me that and I feel myself falling into a deep and dark hole with no chance of escape, even the thoughts of cats remind me of the horrors I faced in that movie theatre and there is nothing I can do to stop it. I fear that I will never be the same again, all I can hope is that my mind will repress the horrid memories that I have endured over the last couple days. I beg of anyone reading this... Do not watch this movie. Just leave a bad review and move on, trust me, it has ruined my life",Negative

1275,"When you give a karaoke competition third runner up an Oscar for effectively playing herself, you're asking for trouble. And though it's taken many years, that festering sore has finally burst through the skin with Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memory in this shockingly unpleasant movie version of a shockingly unpleasant stage show.To be fair to the makers of this abomination, the source material they had to work with is the real problem here - a painfully stupid and tuneless musical based on a collection of poems about cats, the writer of which could never in his wildest dreams have imagined someone would make into a stage play. Why would they? The answer is the key to everything that's wrong with this movie : over inflated ego.It is gargantuan ego that put Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, James Corden, and others to sign up to this and not demand to be edited out after seeing the final depressing version. It is ego that makes Rebel Wilson think she can be the same character she is in everything else she's ever done and she will be funny (spoiler: she isn't). But even these graphic demonstrations of colossal self delusion pale in comparison to Hudson's hilarious performance.To be by far the worst thing about the worst movie possibly ever made is in itself notable, but to quite obviously think you're by far the best thing in a profoundly important masterpiece is ego that mere mortals like you and I can only ponder on. Hudson viciously and sadistically tortures every note of Memory the way anyone with a musical bone in their body has always wanted to torture Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is the only laugh out loud moment of the whole show, and believe me, I was not the only one in the cinema laughing.What is interesting about all this though is that it makes us take a look at ourselves. We sometimes like to think of actors we've liked in various things as good folk who we'd enjoy having over to dinner, even though we've never met them. But what this movie shows is that our beloved thespians are in fact scrabbling back biters who would do anything for a feed yet think themselves superior to us and each other (and yet they all had so much trouble pretending to be cats...).And that's the sad part. Taylor Swift, James Corden, Jennifer Hudson, we already knew about. But Idris Elba, Ian McKellen, Judy Dench - we see you now. And we won't forget. And nor, Ray Winstone, will the owners of Bet365.

They cultivate cockroaches for food and are obsessed with their own names as they sing and dance.Sometimes their faces look weird somehow. It's not all the time. In fact, it's only once in awhile but I'm fixated with the problem. Their human faces don't always match their bodies. Even when it's done perfectly, it's inhuman. I'm going to say the obvious. The CGI is unnecessary. They are better off using make-up and wear leotards. If they're using CGI, I don't understand why they kept the boobs. They need to get rid of the human boobs. Leaving all that aside, I stopped caring about the story. I don't know the point of the story. It suffers the greatest sin of any story. It's boring.

1280,"Honestly,I went into this hoping for a train-wreck. I saw the reviews,and laughed. But this was not what I expected. Cats 2019 feels like someone tried to digitize a Broadway production of the play, but the computer focused too much on face recognition. The choreo and singing feels straight out of the musical, no modern hip hop remixes here. All the main cats get their own songs,and they may just be only introducing themselves and that's it,but they're all done well, and I enjoyed some of it a lot, especially the opening number. 'Memories' actually brought me to tears,something that doesn't happen very often.
The obvious elephant in the room is the CGI, which,yes,does look freakish at first,but by the last third, I didn't care.
This isn't the holiday smash hit the studio was hoping for, but when you realize that it is currently going up against Star Wars, there is little hope for this to make much of a mark at the box office.",Negative

The CGI feline humanoids are nightmare fuel-creeping, crawling, prancing & dancing though a paper-thin plot that drops the viewer in the middle of an unfamiliar & unsettling world without any real explanations. It's also full of (mostly) lackluster musical numbers featuring songs with nonsensical lyrics. To put it simply, this film is litter-ally a cat-astrophe.",Negative

This goes way beyond weird; it's downright creepy at times which is magnified by all the bazillion closeups. That's not the way to watch this show. You have to see the whole stage because there are things going on all over the stage no matter which character the focus is on. With a stellar cast such as this you'd have to really go out of your way to produce a monstrosity like this. I'm sorry to say that that's pretty much what he did. I like Hooper. He's put out some really great stuff. This is not one of them.,Negative

1286,"Outside of a few extremely weird moments, CATS is neither as consistently weird as you want it to be nor as good as the film thinks it is. You get used to the CGI after 5 minutes and after that, it's just the stage show. If you like that, you'll like the movie. I liked the movie a bit more than I liked the musical (for reasons that will become apparent) - but I also really don't like the musical.The script adds a bit more of a story than what is found in the musical, but it's never really able to turn the film into anything more than a collection of vignettes where various Cats explain why they should be the ones to ascend to the Heaviside Layer (a version of Cat Heaven) and be given a chance at a new life.The CGI isn't as monstrous as you fear, though there are plenty of times it doesn't work. Hooper films this movie in exactly the same method he filmed the Les Miserables film - lots of extended closeups and very long-lasting wide shots. The wide shots do a good job at showing off Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography, but the closeups are very unsettling.Unfortunately, the movie is only REALLY weird for about 30-40% of the time. The rest of it is fairly monotonous and it just sort of numbs you. I'd argue it's worth seeing for those weird moments - because they're REALLY weird. But, at the end of the day, if you don't like the musical, there's no chance you're gonna like this movie - because it's just the musical with slightly weirder costumes.",Negative

Most of the cast are good singers ( especially Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy) and the new song ""Beautiful ghosts"" is alright.

And, after seeing it, I can see why. Apart from a song here and there and the train dance number, pretty much everything about the film is terrible...especially its waste of talented and expensive stars. Many times, established stars are given songs that simply aren't good fits for their skills. The biggest example that comes to mind is Rebel Wilson....who I loved singing in other movies. Here, she just isn't that good...and it just goes to show you talented and likable stars are not going to work if the producers are out of their minds. A few other things I disliked about the film would include the creepiness of the characters, generally bad CGI (the opening scene shocked me how rotten it looked), Idris Elba looking naked (and super-creepy) towards the end of the film as well as the really creepy and awful cockroach scene.The bottom line is that this film was a chore to finish....and I found myself asking my family if they really wanted to finish the movie!

I don't need to explain why I think the human-to-cat CGI is visually terrible looking, because it is. Yes the musical has strange visuals as well, but it works as a stage performance. Why? Because were expecting oddness, we know these performers are humans dressed as cats. The key word is ""dressed"", because I fully believe that this movie would've been a lot better if the team behind it just put them in costumes and prosthetic makeup like in the musical. It probably would've been SO MUCH CHEAPER too! I don't understand what the thought process was for this, other than to try and amaze audiences which backfired horribly. So were stuck with human faces and unproportioned lips that shift due to horrible MC, human hands and feet that levitate off the ground at moments and detached looking ears and tails. It's a mess.Moving on past the CGI because I could go on all day, I will say the sets were semi-impressive considering they were actually built. Which again furthers my disbelief as to how they built actual sets but chose to CGI skin-tight catsuits onto actors, but I digress. The musical only takes place in a junkyard, so this movie expands upon the smaller feeling scale of its source material which is nice. Also the story is quite loyal to the musical, and yes there is a story. Could Tom Hooper have stretched out the story to be more suitable to audiences? Yes, but it wouldn't of been ""Cats"" then. The musical is literally a character study, going through each cat (kind of like an initiation ceremony or talent competition) so we the audience get to know them through personalized song, rather than have Munkustrap (our main narrator) describe absolutely everything. It's interesting and each of the cats does have its own personality, we also get to see the smaller plot of which cat gets to be the ""chosen one"" and be reborn into a new life.This kind of loose plot doesn't really work in a film, which is why noone asked for this to be made. I still don't know who was the intended demographic for this film, other than fans of the musical I guess? The casting is well done (for the most part) ,however some actors were clearly cast just to pull in more viewers and not for talent or appropriateness. Rebel Wilson was awful, very unfunny and didn't embody Jennyanydots's character at all, whom is weird and quirky. James Corden was pretty bad too as Bustopher Jones, though not quite as bad as Rebel Wilson. He presented the character more on point at least. The last bad fruit in the basket of the cast in my opinion will probably offend many. I couldn't stand Taylor Swift's Bombalurina performance in this. First of all, she's shown in the trailer quite a lot because she's a huge selling point, but is barely in the film (one song's worth and doesn't even return at the end). Secondly, her song sounded terrible and I think it was the worst in the film tieing with Rebel Wilson's. I couldn't tell if she was trying to impersonate a british accent while singing, or if her tone was just all over the place? Maybe both! Lastly, her CGI looked the worst to me out of anybodys. So that just pushed the illusion the film was trying to create further out the window.Everyone else either did alright or surprisingly better than I expected. Newcomer Francesca Hayward did very well and I feel awful that this is her introduction into film. Jennifer Hudson killed it as Grizabella, though I wish she would've had more screen time and they changed her approach to Victoria. In the musical she's desperately trying to have someone touch her in order to be taken back into the tribe, but in this that moment doesn't happen. Which bugged me more than it probably should have. Idris Elba did well as villain Macavity and Jason Derulo was okay, he just didn't stand a chance against the live actor though in the 80's musical film. My favorite character portrayal was Mr. Mistoffelees though, Laurie Davidson did really well and I hope to see him in more! Everyone else was kind of just alright in my opinion, they either didn't bring enough character to the roll or I just didn't really care for them to begin with. The music was faithful and for the most part sounded good so oh well, though the newly added song I didn't care for because it stuck out like a sore thumb.Honestly, if you want a true showing of ""Cats"" just watch the 80's musical movie adaptation. It's pretty good and close-up so you can see all of the details put into the performances. This movie will probably garner some kind of following, I've already seen fanfiction drawings of Victoria and Mistoffelees. Which probably resulted from this movie surfacing and pushing that ""romance"" more into the light, but it doesn't really bother me. Tom Hooper has definitely become of those directors that either makes massively successful films that acquire acclaim or real failures that people hate. Which is fascinating. If you have a morbid fascination with this film, go see it! If not don't force yourself to, you'll want to leave and regret spending money on an overpriced theatre ticket.",Negative

1295,"Honestly, if you are a true theater lover / dancer you can embrace this movie. I've been a fan of Cats since a small child (talking 4 years old) - and I have also had the wonderful fortune of seeing a production live as well as performing in one as a singer and featured dancer. I felt this adaptation was pretty well thought out and executed to a great level for the big screen. It had the playfulness and musical power of the stage production (thank you, Andrew Llyod Weber, executive producer and executive music director) with all of the performers really embracing their roles and performing at an amazing level. You get so much more context from this movie and there seems to more plot line then in the original story. I loved the added dialogue to create the context - and loved the character choices of Idris Alba and the director Tom Hopper to bring Macavity more to life then in the original Broadway production. I felt every actor and actress in this version executed their characters very well (thank you to Robbie Fairchild as Munkstrap - my fave cat!)- but an EXCEPTIONAL shout out to Jennifer Hudson who embodied such a beautiful version of Grizabella! (Memory made me cry)
As far as CGI - if you can go to a Marvel movie and see Josh Brolin as Thanos and have no issue or see a ""youngified"" version of Michael Douglas then why is there such an issue with seeing performers as cats in CGI?? When I performed in the show it was leotards, wigs with Cat ears, loads of make-up and tails that swung around lifeless (while sometimes getting caught during the dancing) - at least in the movie version we get tails that are interactive.
So inconclusion, I could continue to rave about each individual character, the settings, the directorial choices, dance, etc. but I leave with: if you are a theater nerd or you are a dancer this movie is for you.DANCERS: Les Twins are featured and the Jellical Ball is PHENOMENALLY executed.But Haters got to Hate I guess.....",Negative
1296,"After hearing so many negative reactions to the film, I wasn't holding out much hope for the film. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. Really enjoyable watch. The singing was beautiful. The ballet wonderful. The CGI wasn't as odd as described, and within 5 mins I was very used to the cats appearance. Really nice film, with a beautiful story",Negative
1297,"Yikes.Before anyone tries to discredit me by saying I just don't ""get"" the point of the production, you should know that I have the official broadway recording the was released. I haven't ever been to a live show but I've seen the spectacular show on video time and time and TIME again. I'm aware that it's something to behold, an event devoid of any particularly defined plot or purpose. That's the charm of the performance, after all, right?Well, yeah. But that doesn't translate to a film. A group of human beings in cheap costume with low-grade CGI prancing about without a purpose on a movie theatre screen doesn't work. It's not a performance of the broadway show; it's a feature film and in that venue it fails miserably. The talent that was employed for this production aren't showcasing their strongest efforts, the main name (Taylor Swift) was literally put in to sell tickets to the movie; her character ultimately does nothing for the film.I really don't care that there's a ""new song"" or that there's a ""big budget"" put into this movie. All the money in the world can't take a concept that works good in one medium and make it into a good film. This performance belongs on the stage and on CD. As a film it's bland and it leaves nothing but a horribly vile taste in my mouth. This movie is a real hairball, no question about it. I wanted to chase these cats away with a spray bottle. I hope I never have to endure this torturous mess again.",Negative

CGI has come so far, so you'd think that would be good too. But somehow it just added to how terrible this is.The CGI is awful. The script is awful. Some of the songs that were great on stage are somehow awful. The blame lies with whoever decided not to animate this and went with CGI instead.I have never seen so many famous names in a cast and thought wow, this was a pile of poop.Wait for it on Netflix for free, it's that bad. And there were only about 30 people in my showing and 4 of them left and never returned. That's how tragic this movie is, and it's a great musical on Broadway, just so NOT in this movie.

I can't stop starring at their feet. They didn't even try to make it look a little real. No depth of fiel, nothing. This just makes all the dancing and moving so unnatural.Some songs and voices are good but the overall movie is just really bad. I wanted to leave after 20min but my mom paid for the tickets and I don't want to be disrespectful.I don't think this should have ever been adapted for the big screen. Because of all the reasons above but I also think it's just too theatrical and just doesn't adapt well. I have no doubt this would be 10x more enjoyable played on a Broadway stage.Stay away from this movie.",Negative

1310,"Sometimes in life we all ignore that quiet still small voice inside us, that voice with wise judgement urging us to make the right decision, sadly for me I recently ignored this inner voice and my want to see what has been called one of the most downright bad film's of all time is a case of curiosity almost killing the (Eddie) cat.I, like many others had no great desire to see the cinematic adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical Cats, especially after witnessing the close to frightening trailers, that for some reason decided to mould felines and humans into some form of monstrously designed evil hybrid but after all the press proclaiming the depths of despair this film sinks to, I felt it was my duty too catch it first hand.What I and other viewers are greeted with is a film so lifeless and devoid of any form of spark, that it's nigh on incomprehensible that not only Oscar nominated director Tom Hooper is the man responsible for this crime against film but that he managed to secure 100's of million in cash to make it and recruit an A-list cast to partake in its follies.How any sane person could read the Cats script and think it was going to turn out in a reasonable way is beyond me, as Hopper and his writing team lead this almost entirely song and dance experience through a plot that doesn't even pretend to have a story.There's certainly visions I will never forget, that much I can give the film, images such as James Corden lapping up delicious treats with his cat tongue, Sir Ian McKellan meowing seductively to the camera, Jennifer Hudson's runny nose and Rebel Wilson eating human cockroaches are but some glories but trying to figure out what is happening in this jellicle madness is not worth the brain power.After a seemingly never ending opening song and dance number that almost sends you off the deep end before the shows even really begun, the tale of Francesca Hayward's abandoned cat Victoria and her night out on the town being introduced to all manner of fluffy friends is two hours of pure tedium and pain as we begin to not only question the films existence, but that of life itself.The whole experience is supposed to be a fun and colorful trip to an extra ordinary feline world but despite some undeniably great costumes and set design, this family rated feature is akin to some type of Lovecraftian horror trip as we traverse graveyards, milk clubs and back alleys on our quest to find out who indeed from these cats is the most jellicle.Towards the end of Hopper's disasterpiece, Dame Judi Dench's cat matriarch Deuteronomy stares directly at the audience and proclaims about what we have all learnt throughout the last few hours, it's a bizarre ploy, a scary and uncomfortable ending to a film that needs to be seen to be believed but one that I beg you not to ever watch, let that curiosity go and don't make the same mistakes I did.Final Say -Cats is truly unlike anything we've ever seen before and I trust we will never see again.A plot-less, painful and embarrassingly bad big budget extravaganza that will live long in echelons of epic Hollywood failures.0 snooty noses out of 5",Negative
1311,Do not watch this horrible film. Save the cash for buying the Joker movie.,Negative
1312,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Tom Hooper must really enjoy this process. In 2012 he brought mega-hit stage musical LES MISERABLES to the screen. It was nominated for 8 Oscars and won 3, including one for Anne Hathaway. This time, Mr. Hooper again turns his talents towards a colossally successful stage musical, and costumes, make-up, and visual effects are even more crucial. Whereas Les Mis was adapted from Victor Hugo's novel, CATS was adapted by songwriter Andrew Lloyd Webber from a 1939 poetry collection of T.S. Elilot. Of course, Mr. Webber is also the genius behind other brilliant musicals, including THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (from the novel by Gaston Leroux).Tom Hooper and Lee Hall have adapted the screenplay from the stage presentation, and the sung-through musical approach means there is minimal dialogue. Songs are used to tell the story and introduce the key characters. Choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler (a 3-time Tony winner, ""Hamilton"") is the real star. Multiple dance styles are featured, including: classical ballet, contemporary, hip-hop, and traditional tap. The dancing is tremendous, and of course, a big part of that is Francesca Hayward, who plays new kitten on the block, Victoria. Ms. Hayward is a Principal Ballerina at The Royal Ballet. Numerous other skilled dancers are in the cast as well.The story (such that it is) revolves around a tribe of Jellicle cats who have an annual ritual of selecting one to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back with a new Jellicle life. Sweet Victoria is unceremoniously dumped in the alley by her owner, and is quickly surrounded by this tribe of cats that basically aren't very nice. It's in this opening sequence where we realize these humans as cats actually look a bit creepy and take a while to get accustomed to. Given the structure, the story plods along through each successive song, with certain characters getting their moment to shine. These include Rebel Wilson as humorous and chunky Gumbie cat Jennyanydots, Rum Tum Tiger cat played by talented musician/singer/dancer Jason Derulo, Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson as outcast Grizabella, James Corden as the usually-hungry Bustopher Jones, and Oscar winner Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy. Always hovering, is the mystical Macavity played by glowing-green-eyed Idris Elba, and making a later appearance is Taylor Swift as Bombalurina, singing the Macavity tribute song.The two most memorable numbers come courtesy of Ian McKellan as Gus the Theatre Cat, and Ms. Hudson who belts out the most famous song of the production, ""Memory"", in a vocal and emotional highlight of the film. Visually, it's Mr. Mistofelees (Laurie Davidson) magic number that breaks us out of the muted palette. The other musical numbers mostly just fall flat and aren't very entertaining or enjoyable.It's pure coincidence that the screening for this film was the same day as the new Star Wars movie. The franchise for the latter began in 1977, while ""Cats"" first hit the stage in 1981. That's quite a legacy for both. As for this film version from director Hooper, I do wonder if enough viewers will respond to a musical where the story and songs are overshadowed by the dancing, and the sets and costumes offer no 'wow' factor. Many will find these characters hard to connect with ... at least outside of that incredible Jennifer Hudson vocal. It seems these kitties should have remained on stage.",Negative

The performances were amazing, I loved the dancing, and J Hud was outstanding, I was sobbing by the end. It's just one bizarre musical number after another.Secondly, the CGI really isn't as awful as people are making it out to be. Some bits looked a little off, but it wasn't distracting at all. In fact, at times, it was glorious to look at. The set designs were beautiful, and the way the actors moved was captivating.I can see why people may not like this movie, it's definitely not to everyone's taste, but it's not a bad movie by the time you judge talent and direction. I think it's the lack of story that makes it hard to follow.",Negative

1316,"Cats is way out of my comfort zone: I'm not a fan of West End musicals, I can't stand James Corden (and struggle with Rebel Wilson), and the idea of Judi Dench singing is the stuff of nightmares. However, the lure of seeing something truly terrible and then being able to write a scathing review proved too irresistible; to that end, I wasn't disappointed (plus, the viewing was free for me: I won an Unlimited cinema pass earlier in the year).Imagine all of the roller-skating locomotives of Starlight Express speeding down their ramps and flying off the stage in unison, landing in a crumpled heap in the front row, arms and legs twisted and broken: Cats is an even bigger train wreck than that. Putting aside the frankly bizarre sight of well-known performers with CG cat ears, fur and tails, the film is still 100 minutes of 'what were they thinking?' with a sprinkling of 'who the hell likes this stuff?'.A nonsensical plot (based on T.S. Eliot's 1939 anthology, Old Possum's Book Of Practical Cats) strings together the baffling musical numbers, of which there are many. The word 'jellicle' gets said an awful lot, but no-one explains what it means. It's not unlike a wild fever dream, with bizarre imagery, strange performances and lacklustre song and dance routines pummelling the senses until the final act, in which Jennifer Hudson's snivelling, runny-nosed Grizabella screeches her rendition of Memory (more painful than a cat making itself comfy on your lap) before disappearing into the sky in a chandelier suspended from a hot air balloon.James Corden is as unbearably irritating as I had imagined and watching Rebel Wilson effectively naked except for a layer of fur is hard to take. On the flipside, Taylor Swift as Bombalurina is hot despite her all-over hair, and easily the highlight of the whole sorry mess.2/10 for Taylor Swift, but I almost deducted a point for the mice and cockroaches. Human-like felines are a stretch; anthropomorphic rodents and insects are a step too far.",Negative

Just watch that & spare yourself 2+ hours of your life that you'll never get back.My husband's favorite part was when they all blew up in the end, but then he realized that he dreamed that when he fell asleep during the movie and that was an even better ending than what we just watched.",Negative

The cats are vying for the chance at a new life by being chosen by Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench) at the annual Jellicle Ball.
I will admit there were a couple of weird moments, like when Judi Dench raises her leg in the air after watching Gus the Theater Cat's performance (played sweetly by Ian McKellen). But I thoroughly enjoyed all the performances, the dancing, and the singing. Jennifer Hudson performing Memory as Grizabella will make you tear up, I don't care who you are.......

It's a musical about Cats that has honestly defied all logic for decades anyway! If you're a fan, I feel like you got what you were expecting. It was FINE. Not great, not awful. Fine.

1330,"The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep. TS Eliot, The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock
Though these lines are not from Eliot's cat-naming Old Possum poem, they do reflect his cat preference as the inspiration of Andrew Lloyd Weber's Cats, now on film. Writer/director Tom Hooper's visuals capture the languid London of the story while the actors cannily imitate the sensuous personas of the notoriously enigmatic and elusive animal.Knowing that Eliot could not have envisioned a musical version of his whimsical poem, much less on film, it's not surprising that the musical remains even on film a mess of motifs and a thin story line. Add to that fuzzy CGI costumes and indistinct London backgrounds, it's a critically-panned production that maybe couldn't have been saved even with the magic of modern technology.Lead Francesca Hayward as Victoria is a magnetic ballerina and face, while Dame Judy Dench comes off quite well underplaying Old Deuteronomy, an ancient feline making the momentous annual decision about who will be the pre-eminent jellicle cat. Ian McKellen
as always steals his scenes, this time as Gus the Theater Cat, who appropriately laments the loss of great theater. Any cat proclaiming from London, the seat of superior theater, has the right to complain.Although there's probably more dancing than in Westside Story, the writing is not half as good. To use clichés like ""Look what the cat dragged in! and ""Cat got your tongue?"" is to seriously undermine the spirit of a pre-eminent 20th-century poet. No screenplay Oscar for this musical.Of course, the play and film count on the blockbusting ""Memory,"" sung here by a soulful Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson). Taylor Swift sings an ok ballad for her almost cameo appearance. Magical Mr. Mistoffelees is a pop-like confection that nevertheless allows actors to show their chops while giving the audience another tune to hum on their way out.Although themes of happiness coming from self-awareness and memory play throughout to unify the discursive story, Idris Elba's bad-boy Macavity is just not bad enough to lend gravity. Busy sets and sometimes lyrical song and dance can't redeem an otherwise flaccid story.If for only one of my favorite poets, I wish this play had more than one weak life, but maybe with eight more possibilities it will be worthy of Eliot and Hooper.",Negative

1333,No this wasn't Broadway. Nothing can outdo that. This was a movie projection of the Broadway play with a complete set. Broadway is like reading a book and it becoming your imagination of what the set looked like. This is how Andrew Lloyd Webber saw the set. The main character is a ballet dancer in London. And one of the guys is a ballet dancer and tap dancer in London. I commend them for their talent especially his tap dancing skills. You could tell he had been tap dancing from a very early age. WOW! Jennifer Hudson singing Memories was excellent. Her singing is so soulful. Taylor Swift sings Beautiful Ghosts and I enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed it very much but you have to go in watching it as a movie not a broadway play. Two very different things.,Negative

Since I was familiar with the songs, I did note that some songs were not what they could of been, but overall they were very entertaining and even moving. During one song, I started off a little disappointed, but by the end of the song, enjoyed it very much. At a few points near the end, I got emotional and had chills. The plot line was very understandable for those who have never heard of it.
If you enjoy musicals, dance numbers, and Broadway-style solos, the movie is worth your time. It was a movie I would watch over and over and recommend to friends. Actors did a phenomenal job and obviously Jennifer Hudson was amazing. Quite a few ""new"" actors who did a wonderful job as well. Excited to see where they go in the future.",Negative

This remake tendencies that we are seeing suck, if you really have something to say or do with an adaptation do it, but don't rip it off and prentend we'll enjoy it like the real thing, not even if you cast Taylor Swift or Jason Derulo... p.s. BS",Negative
1340,"I just went to see the film adaption of Cats - I think it has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen.The film itself was largely devoid of storyline and frankly quite boring. The visuals were nice but overall it was gaudy. The choreography was OK but the vocal performances were questionable.The CGI and the movements of the actors was interesting but only for a few minutes. The way the cats moved varied throughout the film (walking on two feet or four feet) and I noticed a few errors in the sizes of the cats compared to their props & scenery.All of the sung parts seemed to be recorded 'dry', without any acoustics appropriate to the setting of the scene, which really spoiled the realism for me. Sounded just like the actors were in a vocal booth, two inches from the microphone.Several people walked out of the cinema halfway through, and I don't blame them. I stayed until the end in case it got better, but it didn't.",Negative
1341,"So so so terrible. From acting, to singing, to plot, it is all so horribly bad. BUT the worse of all is the CGI and use of technology. It doesn't even come close to looking good. Things float and move around, mostly their feet, that it looks so laughable.I recalled that I had heard it was bad, but that was 3 years ago. I didn't remember the what or why was bad about. Heck, the world experienced the COVID pandemic a few months after this movie was released. Anway, I received free HBO for the weekend, saw this, and decided that I had to see it for myself. I wished I would've come to IMDb to reminded myself about the bad the comments and reviews.I'm not making a joke here: I'm honestly surprised that HBO is even showing this still. If any of these actors have any kind of self-respect, they would demand that this film is never shown again. Stay away; far away. Wear a mask and don't get contaminated by this show.",Negative
1342,"Not at all as bad as the critics said. Sure it's not like watching the musical but the singing and dancing is very good. The characters are a bit one dimensional but they are from a book of poems for goodness sake. Judy dench has her lovely screen presence in it. It's a perfectly watchable translation from the film, given a bit more explanation than the stage play. I prefer the mungo Jerry number in this to the musical. In short. Watch with an open mind and not based on what the critics say.",Negative
1343,"I wasn't expecting much. I have never seen the musical. I have heard the song Memories, but that's it. All of that said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Jennifer Hudson was incredible! The other stars were almost as memorizing for me - although keep in mind, I am someone who used to dance, and could watch hours of ballet without boredom. Well done!",Negative
1344,"They spent a whopping $95M on this crap. Tuneless musical based on a Broadway show and starring computer generated fur stuck around the faces and bodies of some actors singing too loudly. The original choreography was dumped in favor of what the CGI could produce.The major critics have all lambasted this bomb and the awards season has pretty much ignored it. Even Judi Dench couldn't squeeze a good mention out of any of them.Critics have said the sets are ugly and the CGI flying bodies go all blurry. Even the close-ups of singers, faces framed in CGI fur, go all wonky if they move. It's like a series of auditions in close-up or even worse, cat night at your local karaoke bar.Most of the actors are (blessedly) unrecognizable but Ian McKellen, Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, James Corden, Taylor Swift, and Ray Winstone are all in this back-ally mess.",Negative
1345,Me and my boyfriend went to see Cats whole heartedly ready to enjoy it. Cats was a mistake. It is an affront to the people who created it. We walked out just over an hour into the film. People aren't exaggerating about how bad it is. It's THAT bad,Negative
1346,"Okay so I love musicals and cats (the animals. Never seen the musical). I went into this movie with a VERY open mind. Let me tell you: this film was *dreadful* in absolutely every respect.
There is zero storyline.NO character development (I don't actually think there are characters)The CGI is appalling and overused.The songs are forgettable.The dancing is CGI'd for the vast majority of the film.The singing is spoken, with the exception of 4 bars of 'Memory' (the ""highlight"" of the movie).There is no development of anything, just one song straight into the next song with no explanation of where the plot is going or why.I have NO clue what the film is actually about.I watched the entire film with my hands over my face and almost feeling angry for putting myself through it. A truly bad movie.",Negative
1347,I don't know why this movie was ever made and I don't know who the movie was made for. Because the jokes are so stupid I don't think kids would laugh at it. Just don't bother.,Negative
1348,"Honestly, I don't know how expectation here ever got beyond what the project always said on the tin. Humans dress up as cats and sing a mixed bag of songs and it's sort of a fabulous hot mess. If this premise is for you, then you'll like it. If it's not, you won't. (See also: Cats the musical.)Increasingly we are allowing ourselves to be pushed towards extremes of opinion on everything, and it's ruining our ability to see the shades of truth in between. The CGI in Cats bothered me far less than De Niro's waxy face in The Irishman (a film I liked far better than this, in spite of its needless miscasting).The scale problems didn't bother me much because I just suspended disbelief. I'm watching a movie in which cats sing, so really I'm not looking for dimension realism.Jennifer Hudson belts THAT note out, and it's a bit of a moment, but I'm not sure her sobbing throughout the song was the appropriate creative choice for the lyrics. But Judi Dench has bags of cheeky fun, and Laurie Davidson is a charismatic Mr Mistoffelees.Honestly, I left the cinema feeling like I'd seen a perfectly OK movie which couldn't be a lot better because the inherent source material isn't all that brilliant.To dismiss it outright, or enjoy kicking some pretty decent performers and dancers who enter into the spirit of it, isn't an especially balanced form of criticism.",Negative
1349,"The Emoji Movie, was... a terrible movie. But Cats takes the cake for the worst movie of all time. Like, if we compare them both together, The Emoji Movie is a million times better. The Emoji Movie, while obviously a big waste of time, at least had some funny moments and decent voice acting, for the most part. It also didn't make my eyes bleed from the CGI. Cats, on the other hand has no redeeming qualities. Trash music and story, as well as disturbing and nightmare fuel ""cat people"".",Negative
1350,"The movie theater was pretty full. And about 10 minutes in, it was full of sadness. You could tell people were getting angry. After about 15 minutes, I couldn't hear the movie over the crying, yelling and one guy was even howling. Three older ladies beside me took out lighters and lite themselves on fire. They just kept screaming, ""We're free, we're free."" We all stormed to the front counter to get our money back. Ans what do you know, they just had cardboard cut outs of CATS sitting up front. They were just toying with us. So we did what any logical person would do, we went out side and started punching cats.",Negative
1351,"Absolutely nothing made sense in this movie. Every visual aspect was nauseating, and an absolute waste of great talent. Jellicle zero out of jellicle ten",Negative
1352,"I am not a cat lover, but i love musical theater. In 1984, when Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical Cats opened in Washington, DC's National Theater, i went to see it for the first time not knowing what to expect. I was blown away by the music, the staging, the concept. Over the years, i went to see the musical on stage three more times. And i couldn't wait to see a big-screen version that can be enjoyed by one and all, and not just those who can afford theater tickets. Finally, my dream has been fulfilled and i can die in peace. Cats the movie is pretty much what i imagined the musical on celluloid would be, with its near-purrfect casting and excellent choreography. While everyone was good in their own way, some impressed more than others. My favorite number and performer is probably Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat featuring Steven McRae followed by Mr Mistoffelees with Laurie Davidson and original song Beautiful Ghosts sung by newcomer Francesca Hayward. Also delightful with their turns were James Cordern as Bustopher Jones, Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots and Jason Derulo as Rum Tum Tugger. A lovely surprise was Taylor Swift who wowed as Bombalurina, proving her early doubters wrong that she could carry off that role. The part of Old Deuteronomy, played by male actors in the stage versions, was given to Dame Judi Dench; she who became the first female M in the Bond franchise also did justice to this dignified role. Haters who decided not to like or love this movie before or after viewing it will find any reason or excuse to hate it. As for me, watching this Cats on the big screen left me ""feline good"".",Negative
1353,Went to see cats without seeing the musical or knowing the story (Not much if a story though). Once you get over the actors being cats you can appreciate that is is a film with dancing and singing which is done very well. Jennifer Hudson singing memory is outstanding (she can bang out a tune!). I would say go see it with an open mind and you may well enjoy it.,Negative
1354,"I think this film is overrated, I had high hopes going to see this film because the musical was good but it isn't good when you have the entire movie just singing about cats!! I didn't even understand what a jellical cat was and I found it really annoying.There's no plot to it and I wish it had some kind of backstory or at least some drama but it was terrible. I was bored out of my seat and waited for it to finish. It was so boring. They wouldn't stop screeching their voices.It's like that film you watch and you forget about for years like some nightmare",Negative
1355,They originally had a concept for a 2D animated film that looked amazing. Instead they went with this.,Negative
1356,"I never saw the Broadway show and did not know the story ahead of time. I already had my ticket before reading the reviews. I do not agree with the reviews of it being garbage and I am not sure why people said they were waiting for an orgy. There was nothing sexual about it. The cast was very talented but my opinion of the movie is that it was extremely boring. The costuming of the heads and faces were very unique and it was all a bit strange looking, especially the tails, but believe me, there are a lot of talentless garbage movies out there, this was not one of them.",Negative
1357,"Well, I finally ignored the bad reviews and sat through this, and what can I say about it? Well, it at least improves over the play. Yeah, the CGI was a disaster, there's no getting around that; they tried something, and it didn't work, and unfortunately, most people can't seem to see beyond that. But the movie and story itself, an improvement in every way. First, it actually has a bit of a story. The original play, it was basically one cat after another appearing and singing about their one defining feature, and that's it. This, while it does that too, at least expands on things and gives more characters actual character rather than being a one song appearance character.The story and character of Victoria and Mistoffelees are really expanded upon, especially Victoria, who is now the main character, as is their relationship, and Macavity and Grizabella a little bit too, giving more depth to their character and investing you in them and their interest a little more rather than them just appearing for a single song and dance, and then they no longer matter. Instead, they actually take part of the plot and the overall story and have more to do with things, especially Victoria, who even gets her own song and helps out Grizabella instead of just being another background character. For example, instead of Mistoffelees' song just being an introduction for and about his character, the scene is given more depth where he's trying to gain his confidence to save the day while the others support and encourage him. It also introduced him earlier and established he was magical back then rather than have him be a deus ex machina like in the stage musical. Little details like this go a long way. They actually do the ""show, don't tell"" rule for all of the characters to show what they're like rather than the play that only sings what they're like and doesn't show it.Of course, overall the movie still isn't much of a story, but at least it's an actual story instead of one random song and dance strung together by another for something that pretends to be a story like the wayt the actual musical was, so it feels like there's actual some kind of stakes or plot to follow. When it comes down to it, story and characterization plays the biggest part of a movie, and this at least has that with some of the characters, which the play doesn't (excluding Grizabella). In the original, the only character you really feel anything for is Grizabella, but in this one, you can feel at least a little bit for some of the other characters, which is an improvement over the play.Obviously, the movie was still a flop, and the CGI did not work out, but if you compare it to the original, it improves over it in almost every way, which is at least some kind of win. Not that I'll be watching either of them again, but I'll take this over the original any day.",Negative

People say they liked the musical but not the movie due to the music. It was the same music except for 1 new song and the music for one song changed but the words were the same. I didn't want it to end and wished they had added a few more songs. The visuals were amazing and I loved the little mice. Also glad that they made Victoria the new cat to explain what was happing which I had to do for the broadway musical. Yes it was different but it was suppose to be.",Negative
1363,I got a case of cat scratch fever watching this hairball of a movie.,Negative
1364,"Actually, I wanted to give it 1 and a half but the feedback won't let me so I rounded it up to 2 instead of down to 1 on the strength of Taylor Swift being in it.
(The other one was for the brilliant Rebel Wilson, the only joy in the movie)
So, why did it bomb and why did I rate it so low? Easy...it's a dire film.
The music is appalling and there's nothing at all to sing along to and no catchy tunes whatsoever. That's a big fail for a musical. The 'lyrics are boring and uninspiring and tbh half the time I could not make them out anyway.
The acting is appalling. I honestly thought Francesca Hayward's 'character' had a rigid face for the first half hour as hers never changed. You can tell she's a ballerina but her posh poses had no place as a cat. She should have been taught to dumb down her posing.
The CGI wasn't very good. The sets all looked as if they were going to be great but had not yet been finished off. The very human faces were too human, they were human faces on cats' bodies, bizarre. They should have cat-ised the faces so that they suited the bodies. And boobs on cats??? Rebel is a big lass, they should have dealt with her breasts in CGI to make them more cat like.
Finally, the story was crap. It was long and drawn out at the start and then amounted to nothing.
I admit I didn't watch the final part (maybe 20 mins or so) I honestly just couldn't bare it any longer.
Conclusion: Everyone should watch this movie just to see how bad movies can actually get.",Negative
1365,"The biggest monstrosity of the year malformed and melted computer cats dancing via cgi with blurry legs and no feet it's like they spend all the budget in the biggest and overrated stars like Taylor Swift and James Corden by the way the worst in this movie.

1368,Just a fun fact if you ignore the stupid plot and the scary ps2 faces and focus your attention on the feets of the characters (especially in the background) you can see that the cats hover along the surface.

Every cat singing about being cat? It supposed to be something that would catch audience in 2019-2020? Also comedy genre? Is this for seriously?
It was so bad. Now I will have nightmares after watching this.",Negative
1376,"But it's technically a bad musical. So its actually a pretty decent adaptation (and I've seen the musical too). The appeal of Cats is the songs and the musical numbers, and the movie did right by both.The musical numbers were terrific and the big name singers all delivered. And most surprisingly there were some really weird visuals that left me with my jaws agape. Crazy. My body was ready for anthropomorphic cats but it was not prepared for.... well, i won't spoil the craziness. All i'll say is that I've never seen anything like it.",Negative
1377,"""Cats"" is such a strange film. If it had taken a much, much simpler, stripped-down approach, it could have been charming and sweet. Talk about gilding the lily: the filmmakers chose to pile on the CGI, and along with it a lot of unnecessary dialog and additional ""plot"" to this paper-thin musical. The Broadway show is a silly string of funny songs with one poignant ballad thrown in; the movie strains to add an actual storyline for no particular reason.To be fair, some of the performances are just fine, particularly Francesca Hayward, who does a marvelous job with her songs and is wonderful to behold in her dance scenes. Those bright spots are few, though, with truly awful, broad, unfunny vaudeville from Rebel Wilson and James Corden. Wow, are they bad. They act like friends watching the movie will be impressed, as if they're in a high school play and need to ham it up. Will Rebel Wilson ever star in a role that doesn't feature her constantly hurting herself, doing pratfalls and smacking herself in the face?A scroll through this IMDB page shows you just how many people were involved with the creation of this film. How much money and effort could've been saved here, just approaching the light, cute source material with simplicity.",Negative

1380,"Ok I know I am not the only one wondering why they decided to make the remake of this. Play on Broadway was awesome, this? Not so much.

Nothing in the movie is real (like Star Wars either) so stop criticising the human-looking cats. Jennifer Hudson's interpretation is outstanding and the cast of singers and dancers do a great job. Francesca Hayward is lovely as Victorìa. James Corden however, looked a bit disconnected from the character and was two much James Corden. The story goes fine until we have seen about 40% of it and goes down, turning too slow, then it manages to recover to have a decent second part. I don't regret it. Maybe it's because I like musicals.",Negative
1383,"This does not translate well onto film.
First half... didn't care what happened to anyone, wondered if this would be the first film I walked out of.

Jennifer Hudson's weird beard effect.
Jennifer Hudson crying through the whole film, sing the damn song and stop with the gurning!
Ian McKellen lapping out of a bowl.
Judi Dench singing. Love her, hate that someone said ""sing it, Judi"".

1384,"Rarely does a film come along that feels like a cultural misstep of epic proportions, but Cats (2019) is undoubtedly one of the worst movies in cinema history. It's not just bad-it's a baffling, cringe-inducing spectacle that somehow manages to fail on every conceivable level.The CGI is nightmarish, creating grotesque, anthropomorphic cats that are neither charming nor believable. The story-if you can call it that-is a nonsensical mess of disconnected musical numbers, with no clear direction or emotional resonance. Even the cast, which boasts an impressive lineup of stars, seems uncomfortable, delivering performances that range from awkward to downright embarrassing.From the unsettling production design to the lack of any coherent artistic vision, Cats is a disaster that defies explanation. It's not just a bad movie-it's a cinematic trainwreck that will haunt audiences for years to come. This is the kind of film that makes you question how anyone involved thought it was a good idea. Cats isn't just a flop; it's a monumental failure in the history of filmmaking.",Negative

After that, not so much. Laughs are replaced with a feeling of torture. I would play this movie 100 times to my worst enemies.",Negative

If you don't like the theatrical version and have never read the poems, then you probably won't like it. If you know and like both, then you'll appreciate the movie. It could've been better, especially with more dancing, but the music stays true to the Broadway and West End classic, and the newly injected plot is a nice and slightly cohesive add.

The story, music, and acting could have been amazing, but no one will ever know because visually the entire film is like a million fingernails scratching slowly down a million chalkboards. It was like Gilbert Gottfried singing the most beautiful song ever, the song itself is still good you just never know it because it is dressed in the worst visual effects ever.

I almost did walk out about 30 minutes in when a number with singing mice and tap-dancing cockroaches (I'm not kidding) started up but I stayed. It got much better after that. Most of the songs were unmemorable but I loved ""Mr. Mistoffelees"" and (of course) ""Memory"". Also Jennifer Hudson was superb in her role. She sang ""Memory"" so beautifully I started crying.

1404,"I'm well behind with my reviewing following the Christmas break, so I don't have much hope of coming up with anything new for one of the most critically derided films of the year . . . but let's try anyway. I have been to see the musical, staged by a reputable touring company, and frankly I hated it. This is not some reaction to the genre, I've seen a number of them, and I like musicals. But ""Cats"" is an artless, plotless, pointless show, with one half decent song and lots of hideous synthesizers that betrays its 80's inception. The film is actually better than the musical in one sense, but in many others is a garish, embarrassing fever dream.Victoria (Francesca Hayward) is a young cat tossed into the streets by an unseen owner. She meets the various cats that live on the streets of London, around the theatre district. She comes on a special night though, as tonight is the Jellicle ball when the show off in an attempt to convince Old Deuteronomy (Judy Dench) that one of them deserves to be reborn.So, I think I've already cleared up what I think of ""Cats"" the musical. The best production in the world would still be the worst choice you could make to spend your time watching and the movie is pretty far from the best production. It does have one improvement. Rather than just two hours of characters introducing themselves, there is a bit of a plot now! Idris Elba's McCavity kidnapping his rivals to make himself the most likely Jellicle choice. Smart. Like it. In terms of other positives. . . .erm . . . I suspect, if you like Ballet, you'll get something out of some of the dances. Maybe.Those meagre positives don't come close though to making up for the hideous other worldly visuals of the CGI blending of the actors with bits of cats. . . sometimes it's little better than a snapchat face-swap app. Scale of the characters varies wildly, depending on the scene and in hardly any of them is comparable to an actual cat. Corden and Rebel Wilson are terrible in their roles. Jason Derulo can at least sing, even if his character is as embarrassing and everyone else's. Jennifer Hudson steps all over ""Memory"" with an emotional performance that comes at the expense of the song.People are going a little overboard with their criticism, it's not the worst film ever. It's probably not even the worst film of the year (though I admit I'm struggling at the moment to think of one) but it is pretty awful.",Negative

A few safety tips before going into the theater to see this.
1. Plant your entire face into a bowl of bleach, keep your eyes open (it's worth it, trust me!)
2. Buy a box of cotton swabs, soak them in gasoline and then shove as many as possible into each ear until you can't fit anymore, then use a lighter (a match will do) and light both ends.
3. If you survived all of this and your still seated at the movie, repeat steps 1 and 2 as needed.",Negative

1409,"I have to preface this that I never saw the Broadway musical or previous movie. I had no idea what the story line was. I was just expecting a musical about cats. So why the horrific reviews? I don't always love musicals. The songs in these were somewhat weird; I only knew of the song ""Memories"". But I thought Francesca Hayward was cute and very watchable, as well as Laurie Davidson and Robbie Fairchild. Loved the dancing and the sets. We go to movies to either learn something and/or be entertained. Did I learn anything? No, but now I know what Cats is about. Would I see it again? No. Was it terrible? No! The dancing, the sets, the cat ""acting"" and the weird story line - it was entertaining and visually impressive.",Negative
1410,"Have seen worse. I didnt fall asleep (which is a good barometer for a film). Didnt like Jason Derulo (sp) but I dont like his vocals anyway, also not a fan of Rebel Wilson or James Corden. The main chorus parts were fab (ie the stage performers) and even Taylor Swift did a fantastic job. Jennifer Hudson did murder Memories though and I wish I could un hear it. All in all I'd rather watch this again than have to sit through Avatar (which IMO is the worst film EVER!)",Negative
1411,"Wow this is criminally bad. It's taken me a few years to watch it, and the reviews didn't really convince me not to watch this as movies are often subjective, I just really never really enjoy musicals of any type, but I'm trying to watch new movies that I have never seen and particularly ones outside my regular genre.But is this really one of the worst movies ever filmed? I'm not quite ready to be the judge of that quite yet, but I think almost definitely it has to be in that conversation, especially considering the budget and the huge respected cast attached to it.It does border on unwatchable. I promised myself I'd watch it until the end, I did, because I wanted to review it fairly, but it really was a struggle. I can't actually think of one redeeming factor, possibly it hasn't got one.Firstly, the plot and story is nonsensical, wether it's based on a west end musical is irrelevant, it's a god awful story that has only done well in west end because of its musical and artistic performances in theatre. This movie completely takes the human element out of it, by making its characters computer generated, visually atrocious half human half feline monstrosities that are visually quite disturbing as they look like sexualized cats. Honestly it's quite disturbing to watch, made me feel uneasy throughout.The effects may very well be some of the worst I've seen ever in a major Hollywood movie. Their whole look just doesn't look or feel right, some effects look half finished and incomplete. The cgi sets don't really fare any better, the background and set pieces just don't integrate with the characters correctly, nothing in the sets measure up right in relative to the size of the cats.It's just a mess, it really is. But it has great actors, respected actors who thank God have enough quality material between the lot of them that hopefully their careers will not be to badly damaged from this movie. Sadly I don't think all it's actors will remain unscathed tho, James Corden and Rebel Wilson didn't exactly have critically respectable careers before this, and this could easily be the final nail in the coffin for both of them. I don't expect to see much from either of them after this (turns out their careers have largely dissolved). Newcomer Francesca Hayward may get caught in the crossfire, a respected and acclaimed balet dancer, having this as your first and only Hollywood feature film, and being cast as the lead. Well that movie career dream may have just ended before it really started.End of the day, full blame must go on its director Tom Hooper. This was his vision, and it's completely gone off the rails. There's nothing to save it. Visually disturbing, the jokes are ridiculously unfunny, some awful performances and the music is terrible. I want to say something positive, I can't, because I would be lying. And bugger it, I'll just say it. This has to be one of the worst big Hollywood movies. Of all time.",Negative

This is amazing fetish driven furry clustermadness (the word i wanted to use, i cannot) masquerading as a movie while being a furry play you should keep your kids away from.If you as an adult decide to brave this amazing assault on humanity, you may very well find it superbly gouging your brain out through your ears as you crawl in any direction seeking refuge from the brilliance of this production.This epic blockbuster is basically when somebody makes a casting couch movie for furries and tries to market it to the masses as something, anything, other than that. It is still a casting couch movie but without the couch or casting, so it gets a family rating because kids love cats, right.. right.. right people. Aha. Yes.1\10 i dont think even furries liked it.",Negative
1414,The higher production values needed for film reveals this as an extremely thin and cloth-eared musical. The arrangements sound thin and the choroid dull.

1417,"I don't know who these people are that think this is a ""terrible"" movie or garbage. If you don't ""get"" Cats then maybe I could see some people not enjoying it. HOWEVER, having said that, I loved it.
The producers didn't stray too far from the original musical production. I was afraid they would try and rewrite it to make it more commercially palatable. I LOVE the CGI fur and ears on the actors. You can see they tried very hard to mimic cat movements. The actors are actually able to sing their character parts. They didn't just throw a well known actor in and hope they could sing. Rebel Wilson sounds like a perfect Jennyanydots - waver in the voice and all. Munkustrap (who narrates the majority of the show) has a very clear tone and can carry any part he needs to. I was happy they didn't try and shove TayTay at all of us - she has a very small part all things considered. Francesca Heyward is lovely as Victoria. Her dancing skills show off the power AND grace needed to carry the main character. Jennifer Hudson's version of Memory is mature and moving. Memory is notoriously difficult to sing and singing it well is just that much harder.
All in all this version gives a bit more ""story"" to the musical. You get to see Victoria's interest in Grizabella and her compassion for Miss Griz. Dame Judy is brilliant as always even though she cannot sing as strongly as the rest of the cast. Since she plays the sage older Deuteronomy it makes sense.
This should be up for best special effects or costuming. The ears especially give so much expression to each cat.
If you have seen the Broadway version you will understand why sticking close to the source material is important. Each cat contributes to the flow of the story - even the chorus cats. Most of them have actual names (Bomburlina, Coricopat, Syllabub). In the penultimate action Mr. Mistoffelees is adorable and you can see the confidence build. He is much more shy in the movie than the stage production but it works really well in the growth of his relationship to Victoria.",Negative
1418,"I actually thought I was under the influence of some kinds for the first few minutes but once the weirdness subsided I actually enjoyed this.

1427,"I don't really get the poor reviews that I've seen, I wonder if it's to do with expectations; did they not realise that the film is sticking as close to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's staging and costuming as the director felt fit. I didn't really mind the CGI of the actors' faces, maybe it was thought that something like that would be demanded from today's audiences. or was it just that Taylor Swift and Idris Elba couldn't dance? But for me it was a minor thing and didn't interfere with my enjoyment at all. There were only 2 things that I'd have changed: someone should have got Jennifer Hudson some better crying eye drops, as her runny nose was off-putting, and Idris Elba as Macavity's fur could have done with being a tad longer as Idris Elba looked as if he had no clothes on, but no bits as it were 🙀.
I would absolutely recommend this for Cats fans, if you're not familiar with the show then a little research will help enormously.",Negative

James cordon and rebel wilson were great as well as were the lesser known main characters. Overall, better than the screen adaptation of Phantom.",Negative

Even ignoring the baffling special effects, awkward acting an horrible attempts of humor that not even a psychopath would find funny, the movie is criminally boring in every level, nothing actually happens and when it looks like plot is developing, it stops for another painful musical number with songs that in all honesty were never really that good.This movie misses the mark on every filmmaking level that to call it a ""movie"" is an actual insult to the art form itself. Makes you actually feel sorry for movies like Sharknado that, in their mediocrity, at least can be called movies.",Negative

It's always been a 'marmite' production but for true theatre lovers, it's an epic representation of T.S Eliot's poems. The film brought more of a storyline to the show and the additional song slipped in nicely. Personally I found Jason Derulo disappointing and although Judy Dench was good in her role, I would have cast Brian Blessed as a nod to the original west end production, of nothing else than his wonderful performance of The Ad-dressing of Cats.

1445,"A few days ago, someone on Twitter joked that the reviewers who had just beheld Tom Hooper's Cats on the big screen sounded like Lovecraftian protagonists. I tend to agree, as I recently read on Facebook: ""When you see these things switch between acting like people and acting like cats, you'll think you mistakenly read a page of the Necronomicon Ex Mortis"".What sort of dark, dreary mistake must've been made in our history that it came to the point where this... thing... was green-lit by a major studio? Who is this for? Is this what fans of the original musical want? Are kids supposed to enjoy it? Adult furries?Furthermore, what is it that is so goddamn difficult to understand about live-action remakes, especially the ones with talking animal characters? When we panned the Lion King remake because its photorealism subtracts the magic and expressiveness of singing felines, we didn't mean you should try doing singing felines in live-action AGAIN but this time with characters that are some sort of unholy alien hybrid between man and cat, and can therefore emote slightly more. What we meant, more so now than ever before, is STOP!Cats, as most of you are cursed to know, doesn't dress its dancers up in kitty costumes as per the original stageplay's tradition, nor does it opt for Disney-style CG animals in the place of actors. Instead, it sort of blends the two, giving us digital furry counterparts to Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, James Corden, Jason Derulo, Ian McKellen, and Judi Dench, just to name a few.I don't why digital adjustments needed to be done to these poor performers, as opposed to giving them real-life kitty suits. It makes us suspect that the dancing isn't wholly authentic (computers might have added some magic there), which is a shame since one of the leads is Francesca Hayward, dancer at the Royal Ballet, in her film debut. She has played everything from Alice in Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty, to The Sugar Plum Fairy and Juliet Capulet. She deserves far better.Aside from the night-terror visuals and accompanying cat-person noises, there isn't much to write home about here. If one can get used to the film's agonizing/agonized universe and excuse the possibility that we're not beholding wholly undoctored dancing, it's still pretty useless.The story (such as it is) is the story of Cats, plus some dumb jokes (thanks Rebel Wilson), celebrity cameos for generations Y through Z to enjoy, and other things that stretch it thin. The lovely but narratively useless songs from the Andrew Lloyd Webber production are there, plus some new additions to ensure a Best Original Song nomination, because that's what remakes and adaptations of musicals do, I guess. Hooper's Les Miserables film did it; the Beauty and the Beast remake did it; the Aladdin remake did it; now this.The best thing to come out of this film was a mashup someone made of the Cats trailer and the unsettling Annihilation soundtrack, partially because it was funny, but mainly because it confirms that random Internet users often have a more solid grasp of what makes a good movie and which images go with which mood than Hollywood professionals. Put some obnoxious Benny Hill music over the recent Rise of Skywalker and we have another example.Sadly, I fear the best meme material we got was from the initial trailer. Some fans and cineasts speculate that film studios are doing this on purpose; creating meme-worthy magnitudes of ugliness to help spread the word of their movies. There's even a theory that Sony's non-hideous redo of Sonic the Hedgehog was ready to go before the Internet had torn the initial design a new one; they just wanted the film to reach meme status first. That sounds a little too smart and 21st century-savvy to be true, though.",Negative

1447,"I saw cats last night. Most likely am going to see it again sometime this weekend. Critics are so full of crap its not even funny. First off the sexual comments that every critic seems to be saying. What does it say when critics are finding something to be sexualized more then furries?
There was a kitchen scene was god damn nuts.
I was uncomfortable with some of those camera angles on Rebel Wilson and some of the implied self thigh rubbing....*coughs* Yeah well. And the less said about the mice and cockroaches the better.But beyond that umm no. They are cats + ballet + musical. I'm getting the impression that folks who went to see this film to review it have never seen a ballet or stage musical before. Just because you grab someone by the waist or are in close quarters with them doesn't equate to sexual.I think critics are confused because this is where the term anthropomorphic comes into play. You have people who look like cats who are acting like cats and it's causing problems with ""reading"" the body language of the people in the movie. This is all on the director and choreographer.A lot of the reviews are saying the CGI is bad. Umm no. Not at all. The fur is perfect. The complains about some of the actors wearing fur vs some are just naked. First I saw someone complaining about being neutered. Do you really want to see anatomically correct cats in this movie? Are you sure you aren't a closet furry or something?
The choice to go with characters wearing outfits and some not.....look at who is dancing. The folks who do the most dancing are the ones who are ""naked"" The main characters who are not dancers are the ones who get the outfits. This is purely a functionality thing. Both it saves on the cost of CGI and it allows the dancers more freedom to move.Now my philosophy has always been if you have to explain that the movie was actually good, it probably wasn't.The above simply explains away some the critics baffling statements. But don't mistake that for me thinking this was a great movie. It wasn't. It was OK. It was fun to watch.That said there was plenty wrong with this movie.
For the plot.....Its Cats. The plot has always been almost nonexistent. They could have, and should have expanded on that. Was it bad? No. Its a straight forward concept. New person thrown into a new situation so the audience is learning about her environment as she is learning. A cat at the end of the evening is picked to.....move on by Judi Dench during that time cats are auditioning to be picked. During that time plans are afoot. This is not a complicated plot. Its a plot designed to carry music numbers in it from A to B to C to D. That is all.Now one suggestion would have been to added a little more Disney musical in that the music numbers are interspersed with dialog. To give a bit more breathing room between the music numbers as I think it was breaking the poor critics brain.Next was the cuts in this movie. A lot of, IMHO, bad edits. Jennifer Hudson when singing the iconic Memory was cutting away from her for reaction shots. It broke the mood. There are other examples of that that felt like the camera should have lingered longer.
Speaking of Jennifer Hudson. Wonderful job but, and it was mentioned by another review that I rolled my eyes at but is legit. She cries as she is singing. Sure. Fine. While it brings emotional weight to the scene......we really didn't need the runny nose. Really it was distracting to see that.The interesting thing that I found with critics. Is there are factually inaccurate statements in their reviews. Things that can be quantified. One review complained about the lack of locations. The only major change in location was a railway track on a bridge. Other then that it was just an ally and a theater. That is factually inaccurate. I counted 10 distinct locations. So why the inaccuracy. I suspect that folks were so intent on the cat characters (Ears moving, tail moving, fury moving.) that it distracted from actually paying attention to the film. I wasn't bugged by this because its anthro cats....So? I think anyone not furry needs to see this at least twice.

The translation wasn't at all what I expected, but I was ready to take a trip to that uncanny valley.Now, having seen it, it's quite the spectacle, and not in the way it's intended to be. The CGI is all over the place and it's astounding that they released it in the shape it's in. Faces move, but heads don't move accordingly; bodies look like they're floating, with the feet so manipulated by the effects they don't actually look like they're touching the ground; bodies look distorted to the point that their movements look artificial, when so much effort was put into the choreography. The problems are just so evident.Yet, while watching this chaotic mess of a film, I found myself enjoying every moment. It's like a game, where you start looking for what's wrong in each frame, and there's plenty to uncover. Sure, the cast looks like they're having a decent time, but wondering why none of them thought twice about this being a disaster also supplies some sort of excitement, because it's the kind of bad that is actually fun to experience. I'm glad this exists. It's full of wonder and mania, fluctuating between terror, confusion, and amazement, often in one fell swoop.Embrace the curiosity, grab a drink or four beforehand, and just succumb to this marvelous piece of eventual cult cinema that will be giffed for decades to come. If anything's certain, you've never seen anything like this before and it's hard to imagine anything else coming close to it anytime soon.",Negative
1465,"No no no and no, I was unlucky enough to be dragged along to a pre screening of this absolute drivel. I can't find anything redeeming about this film. It's cringy beyond cringy. Don't do it.

Also it has lot of cringe moments which audience won't know what to do sit there and ripe part they her screen or take headache medicine or last option walk out well that's what I did after suffering from headache from this don't what to saytrash.,Negative
1468,If I could rate this movie a - infinity rating I would.1) absolutely ZERO story. Nothing just soulless singing. Compared with the original Cats musical this is 1% of the quality.2) acting was crap and not because of the cast but because of the way it was presented. Always got interrupted.....3) bad visual effects. BIG problems with scale. The cats wore as big as a car or as little as the thickness of the railway. NONSENSE.4) BORING. We wore literally so bored that we almost fell asleep in the cinema and had to leave.don t waste your money on this.,Negative

Having said that, I am not knocking anyone off who might find this enticing. I'm not even telling that someone they should seek help ... actually all kidding aside, who knows how individuals may feel in hundreds of years ... they may mingle with DNA and clones so much, that something like what we see here becomes reality ... afraid yet? Maybe you should be, but remember: you'll probably won't be alive to see it, so there is that.Really good actors involved in this and after that initial song ... the movie drags on (no pun intended I think, but I'm not quite sure). Puns and ""jokes"" like the one I used as summary are being used by the movie too. I have not seen the musical .. and I do think that some songs are not really bad ... but this movie ... I really don't know how anyone thought this was a good idea ... the money they spent on this ... inconceivable (to use another movies famous quote).I'm fairly certain they only had the best of intentions and if you were actually able to enjoy this ... good for you. Really, not being sarcastic.

The cast is generally excellent and their enthusiasm helps invest in the characters.There are some miss-steps along the way. Interrupting some of the songs disrupts the rhythm. Some of the SFX don't work well and a couple of sequences don't work to well.Cats succeeds non the less in being highly entertaining and memorable.",Negative
1474,"People here love to pile on and criticize a movie without any indication they actually saw the movie. There is not a single fact about the movie in most reviews.The Good
The movie did remain relatively faithful to the original Broadway plot. Of course people may not like that version - but that is the story for Cats. The music was largely the same as the Broadway show with one new tune co-written by Lloyd Weber and Swift - and that tune was not bad. The CGI had some misses, but overall was pretty good. The people turned into cats worked well. There were some great sets.You can't complain about Francesca Haywood. She's very talented and is a principal ballerina for The Royal Ballet. Her acting was pretty good, and she made the movie.James Cordon did an excellent job. Robbie Fairchild was very good. Judy Dench was not perfect, but overall I liked her and her role.The Bad
Jennifer Hudson had the best song and provided a terrible job of delivering it. Terrible. With all of her emotional gymnastics, the melody of the song was gone. Her song - Memories - is the most important number in the production. Disaster.Taylor Swift was irrelelevant. Her character had a 5-6 minute appearance late in the move for a single song. Who cares. The song was okay - an original she co-wrote. But she added nothing to the movie other than a name.Overall, the sound quality of the music was poor - and not as good as a typical live theatrical production. With the budget and the talent available, you expected better. It seemed to have been recorded during filming live scenes with background noise and inconsistent production values.Overall - I liked Cats. I've seen the Broadway production a couple of times, I knew what to expect, and it delivered. It's about Cats. There is no deep plot or story. Just enjoy it and have fun.",Negative
1475,"This movie is boring and disgraces the name of the original Cats. What made Cats on the Stage amazing is that the makeup and dancing/ballet was real. They were actually doing every lift and pirouette you see, as well as convincing acting and costumes that are believable. In this film, you will find bad CGI, where there faces look like they're floating over a head. With CGI, anyone can be a ballet dancer. It's filled with weord back and forth casting. Jason Derulo is an abysmal Rum Tum Tugger, but Sir Ian McKellen is a great Old Gus. Jennifer Hudson has no weight as Grizabella, but James Corden is an alright Bustopher Jones.

1480,"But that's what this movie makes them to be. I know they got the same director, but please, they are all miserable and make us feel that rats and racoons are way more fortunate and frivolous.
If you think the most anticipated song of the whole show, Memory , could do no wrong after a long torturing waiting-time? It went terribly wrong and disappointing, but ""I only expected this 3 minutes to be ok, I expected nothing more!"".... This song sung by Jennifer Hudson had got to be good..... Wrong, it's the worst moment of the entire movie, it was way over done, it's NOT a stage show, it's a movie, but the director thought he did the sad sappy thing in Les Miserables and "" let's repeat history again"" and no need to build up her character !!!
And then, the makeup, costumes, choreography ? >>> way way way TOO SAFE!!!
Especially the choreography. I would pay double of what I paid for this movie just to watch a dance-scene of a Bollywood movie.
I should have just stayed home and listened to Barbra Streisand and Barry Manilow singing Memory , over and over again.",Negative
1481,We went to see this movie despite the reviews. Cats has always been one of my favorite musicals. I've seen it 4 times on broadway. This creation was a pile of crap left in the litter box.

This movie should be properly classified as a violent crime against my eyes and ears, not to mention against good taste in general. I guess I do have to admit that the costumes, the set and props as well as the CGI artists did a wonderful job, but God, why did anyone think this was something worth creating?! Does anyone taking part in it seriously thing that it is good?! Really?! Even if Movies are only created for money nowadays and real cinema is dead, I demand to be paid for watching this instead!

1490,"I feel like just saying this movie was bad is not giving it enough credit.Yes this movie was bad, it was awful. But honestly it was so awful that it turned into a ridiculous almost dream-like experience. For a while I was convinced that we had been duped, it was just a joke, that it was impossible for this movie to actually have been made. I couldn't believe that it cost $70 million to make this below amateur schlock. But it was real. It was real and it was shocking.Like if not for the bad story telling, lack of plot, and seemingly never ending pointless musical numbers, the craftmanship was just not good. It looked rushed and just thrown in there or at the very least unfinished. The actors CGI feet seemed to be floating throughout most of the film. Splotchy green screen rendering left bodies looking comically pixelated around the edges. There was even a scene in which an actor's pants looked completely detached from their body, I'm talking full on blob void between body and clothes. Their faces were just floating on the bodies, almost zero practical effects, just highlighting each and every mistake in disproportionate glory.But back to the bad storytelling. So I went with a group of 4 other friends because we were interested in seeing if it was really as bad as everyone said it was (spoiler alert: its worse). And now we have this running joke that the entire movies plot was either 1. You have to bow to cats when you see them, or 2. Cats are NOT dogs. Because those are literally the only lines in the entire movie that convey any sort of message that isn't a seemingly improvised dance and song or confusing dialogue about whatever the heck a Jelical is.Just trying to list all the errors in this movie is giving me a headache because there are so many, so I'm just gonna stop trying.I'm not going to tell you to not watch the movie or that I didn't enjoy seeing it. Because i had a great time, but not because i enjoyed the movie itself, more I enjoyed making fun of it with my friends, who were uncontrollably laughing to the point of tears and some old lady yelling at us about how we ""ruined the movie"" (yeah no that actually happened) but so was most of the theater, almost everyone was giggling at some point. Anyways long story short: if you want to see a good movie this might not be for you. But if you want a comically (or painfully) bad movie to just laugh at, I'd definitely reccomend it.",Negative

1493,"Go see it. If you've ever seen the theatre production then you MUST see this. If you've not seen it then go with an open mind. Read the poetry it's based on.
Adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical, itself inspired by T.S. Eliot's whimsical poems ; Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. About a tribe of cats called the Jellicles. Who gather once a year to see which of their number will be given the opportunity to ascend to the Heaviside layer. Cats the movie is a slick, computer-enhanced celeb-fest with meticulously choreographed set-pieces taking place in a version of London .Francesca Hayward's 'Victoria' a Principal Ballerina at the Royal Ballet takes centre stage in this remarkable portrayal of the original West End production of Cats. She is not exactly verbose, but her eyes talk plenty, wearing a nonplussed expression throughout as she tries to figure out what in the name of Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats is going on. The score compliments the original 'Webber' magic and stays basically true to the stage musical.If you want a visual feast, knowingly camped up performances from a stellar cast and some beautiful dance & musical numbers this film is a winner. A very well made sentiment to the original stage musical that those who have seen the West End musical will understand totally.",Negative
1494,"I'm no theater nerd, nor have I ever been to a production of Cats to truly compare. However, it wasn't as terrible as some reviewers made it out to be. No one thought to themselves that a movie about cats was going to be a little on the, I dunno, weird side?First and foremost, the cgi was a little ratchet, but you get past that after a short time. Now THE singing by Jennifer Hudson was purely beautiful and brought tears to my eyes! The song, Beautiful Ghosts, written by my girl, Taylor Swift, and sung by Francesca, was hands down my favorite part. You could feel and understand the pain and beauty behind those two characters and it was magic. It literally filled several movie goers eyes with tears with how good it was. Did i mention Jennifer Hudson's singing of Memories 😭 oh, i did.. 👀 BEAUTIFUL AND POWERFUL.One thing i would have liked better and yes i know it's based off a theater production, but more dialogue because some of the singing was... confusing and hard to understand when attempted to be sung by these A-list celebrities. Would have been a nice transition from theater to a movie adaption. My 9 year old daughter at one point whispered to me, ""mom, why are they singing the whole time.."" lolAll in all, it's not that serious y'all. It's a movie about Cats, not a hero saving the world. It's fun and entertaining and enjoyable to watch. The dancing is fun and most, not all, of the songs are great.Did i mention my girl, Taylor Swift?! 😝",Negative

I'm not even joking.The plot is a huge mess. The songs are complete garbage. Don't even get me started on the CGI. I know that they put some sort of effort into this movie, but for 95 MILLION DOLLARS...this movie is a huge disappointment.They obviously casted popular celebrities like Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson and James Corden so people would be more interested in the movie. I'm sorry, but this is supposed to be a musical.If they really wanted this to be like the Cats musical, they wouldn't have casted the people they did. Yes, they are talented, but it just doesn't seem right to have James Corden or Taylor Swift in a musical-based movie (even though James' crosswalk musicals are hilarious.)Believe me when I tell you this--the target audience is probably for 3-year-olds. I would've left if I didn't pay for the ticket. Even if 3-year-olds saw this movie, they would probably have nightmares later. Please DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It's a waste of your time.",Negative

1503,"My Review Cats - my Rating 8/10.As anyone knows who reads my page I like musicals and have acquired some knowledge of this genre over the years . There have been some woeful Screen adaptations of famous Stage musicals eg A Chorus Line (1985) Man of La Mancha 1972 ,Camelot 1967, A Little Night Music 1977 to name a few.The 2019 Tom Hooper "" Cats""does not deserve the vendetta of bad press by so called Professional Critics who I think don't understand the genre of the film musical at all.I'm taking time over my Review as I want people to see this film ,it will polarise some people . I went with my regular film partner and he didn't care for it.I on the other hand enjoyed it very much I had read a little of the bollocking this movie is receiving and also a review yesterday from a friend who also knows the musical stage and film genre so I was so pleasantly surprised to be in the minority camp of people who praise this innovative reworking of a stage musical . Cats has already been filmed in 1998 with the original Griizabella Elaine Paige .If you want to see cats filmed in a studio pretty much as it was on stage the 1998 version may appeal more to your tastes .If you expect to hear the best vocal version of the hit song from Cats ,Memory sung by Jennifer Hudson you won't hear it in this version but her performance as the tired bedraggled and world weary Grizabella is the best acting performance I've seen of anyone in this pivotal role I can understand why her version is so full of pain.I notice IMBD give the 1998 version a 7.6 Rating and this new version a measly 2.6 ?It's terribly unfair and doesn't give credit to the acting and technical expertise that has gone in to this production.The 1998 version while authentic to the stage production doesn't expand the horizon of the wonderful world of Cats or add anything new the 2019 version does.Critics can unfortunately ruin a films prospects at the box office I hate the phrase some friends use "" oh I didn't go and see it because it got rotten reviews "" I always say make up your own mind I've seen so many enjoyable movies that the critics have panned and I've seen some very average films that some critics wax lyrically about.This new version of Cats directed by Tom Hooper ( The Kings Speech, The Danish Girl, Les Miserables) who also was a screenwriter with Lee Hall on this project features some great talent and magical moments . It's a very different setting to the stage production which was basically a big rubbish tip. It pays homage to other screen musicals ,especially Busby Berkeley and Mrs Henderson Presents. Dame Judi Dench was Mrs Henderson and that film was set in The Windmill theatre which also features in this as a set for Cats.The rest of the scenes are in London itself in various locations like Trafalgar Square The Thames and a fabulous production number performed by Steven McRae as Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat on a rail bridge to a great London station.Francesca Hayward a Royal Ballet principle is wonderfully cast as Victoria the elegant timid White Cat who is dumped in the alley where the tribe of Jellicle cats are competing and waiting for their one of them to be chosen by Old Deuteronomy to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new Jellicle life.The plot is basically just that and it's based on a collection of poems by T. S. Elliott . Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs introduce all the characters like Bombalurina, Macavity, Mr Mistoffelees , the magician played so well by Laurie Davidson. James Corden as Bustopher Jones the fat cat in spats is fun Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots is Rebel Wilson.Idris Elba as Macavity the villain of the piece is also very good in the role.Terrific choreography very different in parts to the stage production in fact it's the younger less known actors that are the Stars of this film apart from Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen. Dame Judi I think is wonderful as Old Deuteronomy in fact her final scene in Trafalgar Square moved me to a few tears. Ian McKellen is also wonderful as Gus The Theatre Cat and both these veterans of British theatre add great pathos and class I imagine the rest of the young cast must have felt privileged to be in this film.If I go to see a film adaptation of a musical I want it to be more intimate than the stage version and to transport me and inspire my imagination. I didn't like Tom Hoopers last musical film Les Miserables mainly for live singing if you can call Russell Crowe's voice singing but also because to me it lacked intimacy ,but I must say he has won me over in his latest musical Cats.Please Ignore the negative critical onslaught on this film adaptation of Cats ,make up your own mind . The estimated cost budget of this musical is USD 95,000,000 you can see every dollar spent in the sets and production numbers .The film is doing very poorly due to bad press and deserves a much better reception I hope for the sake of future musical films it does succeed.",Negative
1504,"This movie has a lot of negative reviews because people were expecting a movie, not a musical. So firstly, understand it's not a traditional movie, but a musical based on the Cats play. This means there is extremely little dialogue; it's basically singing and dancing the whole time. You must have a taste for the theatre arts to appreciate this kind of work. So if you don't like musicals, you'd hate this movie.If you judge it for what it is--a musical movie--it doesn't deserve terrible reviews, but it's also not the best either. As a musical movie, it has good choreography, transitions, dancing, singing, etc. It captures the essence of the original Cats play and its weirdness. But it has issues with enunciation, unanswered questions, over-the-top weirdness, and unnecessary dark vibes.The actors didn't enunciate words clearly, making it very difficult to understand much of what they were talking and singing about, which also makes understanding the whole plot more difficult. They failed to explain many things in this movie, such as how did they all get there?, who exactly is the villain Macavity,? how is Macavity able to make people disappear?, why is only one cat chosen to begin a new life?, where exactly are they?, what is the Heaviside Layer?, etc. These questions (or most of them) can only be answered by researching the original Cats play, so the movie itself fails to answer some critical questions for people unfamiliar with the original story. This will leave you being very confused about a lot of things.This musical movie is extremely weird. People in cat costumes crawling around in all fours, scratching and licking themselves, hissing, and very strange positions. Other weird things like mice and roaches with human faces. The way the cats get close to each other's faces and mouths can be very weird and even slightly sexual. The songs, the background music, the scenes, and various characters are all just super weird! On a weirdness scale of 1 to 10, it's an 11.The movie has a dark theme that permeates everything. Dark in a creepy way, like Tim Burton style. Every scene is dark in some way. They constantly interrupt the musical flow to make it sound dark/creepy again. It goes back-and-forth with normal music/singing then sudden dark/creepy again, as if you were watching a horror movie and something bad is about to happen. These constant dark/creepy vibes are completely unnecessarily and damaging to the movie.The biggest question of all that we had was: where exactly are they? All these abandoned cats live in some dark city that they can't escape unless they are reborn by reaching the ""Heaviside Layer"" by singing about their lives. So in summary, you can think of this movie as ""Tim Burton makes a musical"" where human-cats are trapped in some type of Cat Hell/Purgatory who have to competitively sing and dance their way out. It's one super weird musical, but not terrible. It's about a 6.5/10.",Negative

1506,"Was not the fact that they casted famous actors in some roles. I was completely fine with Idris Elba, Judy Drench, Taylor Swift, and Hudson was great. I was NOT a fan of Jemima missing completely. I read that Andrew Lloyd Webber originally thought Victoria and Jemima should be one cat, but it was too difficult to find a role that could both dance and sing. My greatest annoyance is why go with that idea but cast it to someone who can do neither? Victoria should be doing splits and impressive dance acts right, left and center and the crystal clear soprano of Jemima to coerce Grizabella into keep trying would've been miles better than the new song they added. I was even ok with the talking, because I finally understood the plot. Just.. Add some cool parkour and dancing and proper singing. I'd much rather watch 2 hours of Cirque du Soleil that has nothing to do with cats with the soundtrack of the 1998 Cats film added to it than this. I don't know if they missed target audience or ran out of money on actors and CG to get some proper dancers, but please do this again in like 2025, and do it properly. This film was ok at best and should only be shown to little kids to make them understand the plot before taking them to the theatre or watching the 1998 film.",Negative

1521,"Just watched Cats on it's opening morning in the UK.If you appreciate musicals then you'll love Cats - nobody (not event the critics) argued the shear brilliance of the music in this film. Every song is delivered with excellence by some of the world's most well-known artists. There are comical twists and turns but I found myself indulging in every single song.As for the story - this musical follows a very simple, linear narrative - a newly stray cat walks central London as she is introduced to a whole host of new cats. Each cat character has it's own musical performance. It's in keeping with the original theatre version. I found the linear movement from one cat to the next worked in the films favour - focusing on the music without trying to invent any kind of elaborate story line. It truely is a beautiful musical.As a piece of entertainment, if you like musicals then you will love and quite possibly be overwhelmed by the musical magic offered here. If you don't like musical theatre then Cats has little to offer you. This is where critics have stepped low with ratings: rating Cats as a story for the masses - rather than as the simple musical it aims to be.",Negative

1524,"'Cats' is the musical that introduced me to Broadway musicals. When I was a freshman in High School, I admired it so much because it was a show that had nothing but songs to listen to and choreography that blew me away. I was excited to hear that a film adaptation would be happening. I was also excited that Tom Hooper would be directing because I thought he did a pretty good job with Les Miserables (2012). After hearing all the backlash that the trailers got, I still tried to give the movie a chance to hopefully redeem itself. Sadly, it couldn't do it. One of the main problems with adapting 'Cats' into a film, is creating a plot that reasonably connects all the songs intricately. When watching the movie, it feels like there was no effort to do that. You know how people who say they hate musicals because characters dance or sing at random moments of the story for no apparent reason? That's what the movie was. The transition from one musical number to the next felt weak. In some cases we get back-to-back songs, as if we are suppose to just ignore the song that came before it. I believe most of the attention when making this movie, went more into the CGI, set designs, and paying the performers. No one really thought about the story! With a musical like Les Miserables (2012), the story and context are told through the songs. My guess is that Hooper thought that there was no need to focus on the plot because the collection of the songs would tell the story as well. If that's the case, he was absolutely wrong. The only sense of a story developing, were these two characters that fell in love with each other. I liked that, and they should have done more stuff like that. I think a lack of effort and creativity caused by some unmentioned obstacles made the movie a lot less enjoyable than it could have been.",Negative

1531,"Given the all the negative reviews from users and critics, I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I have read T.S.Eliot's ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats"" twice. And I have seen the stage musical 4 or 5 times in the 90s and loved it. But a movie gives you close-ups of facial expressions and (feline) interaction that is not visible on a live stage. The music was as I remembered with a few additional songs, and some spoken parts to help the narrative. The actors dressed/CGI'd as cats, is no more unexpected than they were on stage. I don't deny that people who are not at all familiar with the book nor stage production, may find the appearance of the ""cats"" to be unusual, and the songs somewhat disconnected. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it and watch it again.",Negative
1532,"I read the reviews for this film because the rating was so bad (2.8 at time of writing). The reviews were so bad that I had to watch the film...I was very surprised, this film isn't bad at all. In fact as far as stage musicals transferred to film go, it is good.. better than good even. I think the problem is that the reviewers that gave this 1* didn't actually understand what they were watching. It's a fantasy musical, it's supposed to be fantastical. As for the reviewers that said there is no plot or story, Cats doesn't have a plot or story because it's based on a book of poems about different cats.",Negative

1536,"Star- studded casts do not equate to be a great movie. Especially the Broadway musical play turned to be movie can be disappointing to someone. Back in 1980s, Betty Buckley perfected, Grizabella in Broadway. Tough act to follow once someone perfected and branded the role. Her version of ""memory"" still gives me a chill and makes me cry. Also Broadway casts of Cats were in shape back in 1980s. I have that version embedded in my mind and I'm sure many people shares same sentiment.",Negative
1537,No plot. Horrible CGI. No character development. No suspense. No antagonist. No protagonist. Just a bunch of random garbage and terrible CGI so bad that it was the cheesiest thing I've ever seen. I really don't even know what that was supposed to be.,Negative

There was little to no plot, and where there was plot, it was lost in chaos and disgust. There are multiple misplaced silences of heavy breathing and scathing stares.

Also the cats are creepy and their clothing is inconsistent.",Negative

1542,"I thought the film was perfectly fine as entertainment, the song and dance routines were great, the direction, cinematography, scenery etc was rather pleasing.
I've never seen the play or the even heard the story so for me the whole affair was enjoyable, maybe the hate is because the film has not done the play justice. For me it's an ok watch.",Negative
1543,"At least Ishtar provided a few laughs... I can't begin to understand the thought process. It's horrid! The biggest problem was the CGI for the fur, ears and tails of the performers. REAL Cats don't look ANYTHING like these creepy beasts. Ears moving randomly and tails looking like awkward phallic objects. Idris Elba doing a soft shoe and singing? Jennifer Hudson NOT SINGING WELL!!! I wish brain bleach could erase this movie from my mind. A horrid, awful mess. Every aspect of this movie was terrible. Survived the cinema experience... barely.",Negative
1544,"Look, is this movie based on the play cats, well yes of course it is, but understand this it only proves that sometimes you should leave a live show exactly that.
See I saw the live show a long time ago, it was interesting but very entertaining, I will be honest and say I am not a huge fan but to see it live, the cast in makeup and moving and dancing it was a pure show, they catered to the audience which is what a live show does....
Now the movie, oh boy, the music the dancing is truly there, but it feels empty, the look of the cats is a nightmare or maybe some furry dream who knows, and most of all it has movie edits to make it more purrfect, see what I did there. The live show it moves and dancing is in real time therefore more impressive. Also the actors in the movie are catering to themselves, or as I like to say smelling their own farts and loving it, it's like they are laughing at their own jokes, and we the audience are bored as hell which I was. Look some may like this movie, and they are nuts, but the truth is it is bad like really bad, I wanted to leave but I hate doing that so I suffered till the end of this train wreck. If you want to see cats go to a live show or if you have to see how bad this is wait till it is on a streaming channel, Do NOT pay for this movie....ever.

1551,"First of all, it's a musical. There's supposed be more singing than dialogue. I think everyone from Elba to Hudson ( even Ian M ) did a very nice part in their roles. And I don't see how y'all think actors are ""creepy"" when they used the same tech for the Naa'vi of Avatar and they are supposed to be acting cat-like hence where the set has to be larger than normal and the name of the musical/movie. ( Unless you thought the Naa'vi were ""creepy"" too. And no I'm not bashing Avatar. I loved that movie and yes, it's better than Cats. I am just talking about the black suits with the cameras so they can capture the actors' movements and facial expressions while they add the CGI.) To each his own though. I guess I'm the ~horrible cat~ for liking this more than the rest <3",Negative
1552,"Well I'm going to give this a moderately positive score, because I enjoyed it for what it is - a movie version of a stage musical which is based loosely on T.S. Eliot's charming stories. I was accompanied by a neighbour who loves her own cats, and we had both seen the stage musical many years ago. The production uses CGI to enhance the costumes and movements of the human cast, and I think this works well. The performers are clearly still human beings dressed in cat costumes, which seems to be a look that some reviewers can't accept. I presume that some of the negative reviewers might prefer cartoon animation, but I reckon that what this movie does works well.
It isn't Tom & Jerry, or James Bond, or Star Trek, or romantic comedy, or of any other conventional genre. This is a different kind of movie, and I suggest for a different kind of audience: ideally cat-ladies who have seen the stage musical at least once.",Negative

1557,"I too was first confused when I first saw this movie. It's horrific! It's terrible! It's down right creepy at times! And then I realized, it's just under the wrong genre.Cats is the best psychological thriller of our time.The plot focus around a ritualistic killing in a cult from the point of view of a new comer and through glitchy special effects and just straight weird mumbo-gumbo becomes one of the best psychological thrillers of our time.",Negative

The original London cast then again in 1992 and then again at the London Palladium for the revival. The film was different there were aspects added not the same as the show. But for an entertaining evening it's excellent some of the performances are excellent Jennifer Hudson, Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Francesca Hayward were wonderful. I have never liked Rebel Wilson and would have preferred someone else in the part. I loved the fact that the dancers were dancers. Please support this film!! It's great 💓",Negative
1561,"CATS, 6 outta 10, select audience that can appreciate it should see it. Fell somewhere between low brow and high brow & this is why I think not many liked the final result. Cats, the movie, is not nearly as bad as critics and some fans are making it. The designs are beautiful, the perfect blend of realness to believe it in modern film world while not going too over the top & keeping the people's features. I never saw the show before this, so can't speak to the adaptation aspect of it; but it seems a lot of people hated this ultra successful show and hated the film adaptation of it following similar paths of supposedly dumbing it down for a broader appeal. Don't get me wrong: it's not a great movie, but it is (for a limited audience that will find it beautiful) memorable and worth a watch. Performances by James Corbin, Judi Dench, Ian Mckellen & another amazing performance by Jennifer Hudson is worth the price of admission alone. There's not much plot and it runs a bit too long, but has many strong moments. Does not deserve the 2.7 outta 10 it has on IMDB or the 30 of 100 it has by critics. In my mind, it's better than the poorly shot Les Mis film and the awfully bland La La Land, which were fawned over in years past.",Negative

1565,"Even when a movie is just terrible across the board, I always look for positives. I've only ever seen a handful of movies where there weren't nuggets of good ideas or interesting decisions. Despite the design on the cats (which is bizarre but I got used to it as the movie went on), the production design of surroundings caught my eye. The movie does transport you into its world and I credit the team for that. I also thought there were a couple of decent performances, I liked Francesca Hayward as the main character Victoria, Jennifer Hudson is still an amazing vocalist as Grizabella and Ian McKellen was charming as Gus. I was also impressed with the choreography, Cats obviously had talented people involved and this isn't a case where nothing worked.That's most of the positives from the movie, the first negative aspect I wanted to talk about was the absence of a plot. Its easier to get wrapped up in musicals, they're full of pageantry and emotion. But you still have to tell a story and other than one of these cats getting chosen to be re-incarnated.....That's it. But you can compensate with memorable or interesting characters, maybe Cats has that up its sleeve? Another big swing and a miss. A lot of these characters get their moments with a musical number but do we learn more about them? Nope. One of my issues was that minus them being strays, what's so terrible about being a Jellicle cat? Only one of them is having a really rough time (the only other one who has an argument is Gus who's age is a factor). Let them go to the other side. It seemed like something that could be figured out quickly. That's pretty blunt but this movie drives you to that point.Getting to the rest of the cast, they range from the miscast (I felt bad for Judi Dench who kept being forced to sing when I don't think she could), to the underused (Macavity is continually hyped up but Idris Elba gets little time and little to do with that time), to the oddly picked (there was a lot of chatter about Taylor Swift but she's there maybe 5-10 minutes and while the performance is fine but just like her performing).I'm all for a good guilty pleasure film. But if I'm going to enjoy something like that, I want something entertaining or unbelievably bad. I would recommend Cats if it was that kind of awful but its not. It has some decent production design, some bright spots in the acting and choreography but that can't compensate for a lacking story, uninteresting music, weird CGI and poor characterization. Why isn't being graded as a 1 or a 2? I've seen worse (I'd still say worst of the year Holmes and Watson has it beat) and this movie didn't inspire anger when I watched it, mainly just boredom. I recommend you skip Cats, it belongs in the pantheon of movies that should have everything going for it (acclaimed cast and director, popular source material, big budget effects and production) and just missed the mark. Hopefully those in the production can just put this behind them and move onto other things. I'll remember this movie but not for the laughs, just the disappointment.",Negative
1566,"I watch a LOT of movies, this is by far the worst movie I have EVER seen! This movie is packed with celeberities. They should be ashamed of themselves and deny ever being in such a disaster.

They've clearly not seen the original which is just as bizarre and slightly confusing (in a good way). It is not striving for a crystal, intricate plot, it is artistic in choreography, music, set, the use of CGI - not straying too far from the original but has added in a clearer way of seeing the story and wonderful casting and a beautiful new song. Jennifer Hudson's performance of Memory was extremely emotional just as the original.
Not only was it beautiful, it was entertaining generating frequent laughs and a constant interest.
People should see, appreciate and praise this film.",Negative
1572,I only watched it because I felt I needed to see it to believe how bad it is. I didn't hate it anywhere near as much as I thought I would but it was still pretty terrible. I was going to give it a 4 to try and be slightly positive but I couldn't think of a quality that would be worthy of a 4/10 rating so just stuck with 3. James Corden is the worst. Jason derulo's English accent is almost as bad as don cheadle's in Oceans 11. The graphics looked entirely ridiculous. I just don't know who saw the stage version and thought it would translate well to film. It doesn't. It's also really boring and I tried to power through but left after about an hour. The only positive was the music but I guess the film had nothing to do with that really. James Corden is the worst.,Negative

1581,"I had to write a review because I hate that people don't understand the theatricality of the original show and the movie. The stage show is a spectacle. It really has no story. It is a song and dance show with performers in form fitting spandex costumes with tails, ears, fur and makeup. The movie takes the show and heightens that spectacle with realistic sets and locations. In place of the spandex, it is now CGI fur and tails. It's not any weirder than the stage version.What I loved about the movie is the fact that there is a story now. It is seen through the eyes of Victoria. I loved the changes to the script to really connect the cats. Adding to the Macavity story and making him more present in the story. Victoria's journey with Munkustrap as we meet all the Jellicles. Mr. Mistoffelees getting a stronger story line added so much to his solo song.The performances were amazing. Robbie Fairchild was perfect as Munkustrap. His vocals, dancing and acting performance really helped to draw the audience into the story. Ian McKellen's Gus had me in tears. His performance is truly stunning and the work of a master craftsman. Jennifer Hudson's Grizabella was phenomenal. It was so emotionally moving. Francesca Hayward was incredible as Victoria. Her portrayal was so innocent, graceful and her Beautiful Ghosts was so haunting.",Negative

1591,"Cats overflows with creativity and ardor and spirit and energy that comes from the cast onscreen and the people behind the scenes. The sets are mysteriously beautiful. But I think I was most impressed with the dancing choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler and the dancers especially Francesca Hayward and Les Twins. But IMO all the Jellicle dancers put on an amazing show, so much so that there were moments in the film when I kind of wished director Tom Hooper had followed some of the full-cast dances a bit slower. But then again there is something to be said for Hooper's Infectious whirling effect. The singers are as good as the classic songs. Taylor Swift is a flirtatious Bombalurina who sings the nasty Macavity's (good job, Idris Elba) theme song as well as parts of ""Beautiful Ghosts"" & the full version over the end credits. . Jennifer Hudson's tortured, emotional version of ""Memory"" works wonderfully most of the time, especially at the end. This ""Cats"" casts Victoria in the starring role of an innocent homeless kitten rescued by some of the Jellicle tribe. I don't want to be a spoiler so I'll just say Victoria has some adventures as she gets to know individual Jellicles, some more than others. She follows one of Grizabella's ""Memory"" preludes with a sweet and touching version of ""Beautiful Ghosts"". If I try to comment on everyone and everything that makes Cats Cats this would be a very very long review! So just a few more. The comic relief provided by various cast members was uneven, some good, some ""meh"" but these short scenes do make Cats more entertaining and give audience members a chance to catch their collective breath. The most marvelous ""performances by an actor"" were Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat. There is something so warm and inviting about Dame Judi's facial expressions; she was covered with just the right amount of digital fur so that the audience could be moved by them. Sir McKellen is a treasure.He plays an old, seen-it-all actor reminiscing about his long theatrical career with a sense of pride and joy in his craft that is genuinely moving. Thank you, Andrew Lloyd Webber and everyone who brought this feline magical mystery tour to the P.S. A quick comment on the ""trailers"" ~ having seen the complete movie, I feel sorry for those whose jobs were to create 3-minute trailers to communicate the merits of this movie. The film contains so much more than can be squeezed into a trailer.",Negative
1592,"If you've seen the Broadway show, you should be prepared by the cats' looks: the performers are constantly in your face in the theater, wherever you're sitting. If you can buy that live, you can buy it on video.
Also, I really don't see how people would be unprepared for this to be a full on musical performance. I was surprised by the DIALOGUE: people complaining that they sing all the time, well... duh. That's the whole point. Same goes for the very flimsy plot, as there's actually none. The movie tried to pad it a bit in a way that made very little sense, but the original content was fine as it was. If you want to turn CATS into a movie, that's what you're getting: people pretending to be cats, singing and dancing. It's been more than enough for decades on Broadway and the West End, after all. The only twist that I enjoyed was the fact that they used Victoria as a stand-in for the public, as it made the performance more cohesive.All in all, as a fan of the show, I really enjoyed this. Far more than I expected. The first half hour strikes some bad cords with a lot of weird choices in sound editing and a really awful rendition of Jennyanydots.  I'm not a fan of Rebel Wilson or her typecasting and this was definitely no exception. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Thankfully, she's the first to disappear and I'm suddenly #TeamMacavity for that.
From James Corden on, the movie gets very much back on track with the show, and it's quite a jolly ride. The multiple backgrounds besides the street and the theater don't really work, as the different proportions of humans vs. cats are made glaringly obvious when the characters interact with forniture and trash cans, but that's about my major gripe besides Rebel Wilson. ""Macavity"" is probably one of the best songs and I only realized Bombalurina was Taylor Swift when reading reviews... very sorry for whoever went to the movies for her: great performance, but fans should have done their homework and realize one song was all she got.
Dame Judi Dench was, of course, spectacular as usual. I believe she should be cast in ALL menthor/community leader/ultimate boss type of roles, whatever their previous gender. Hell, if they remake Harry Potter in her lifetime, give her Dumbledore, too!!I'm sold, actually.But that's probably because I love the show. I know some Broadway fans were underwhelmed by all the changes and that's ok: like books-to-movies, there's bound to be some nitpicking if you're a fan. Unfortunately, I believe that the majority of bad reviews come from people who wouldn't have been the intended audience for the musical and are, therefore, the wrong audience for the movie. Unfortunately, movies are more widespread than Broadway shows, so there'll be a huge chunk of moviegoers who won't be interested.",Negative

1611,"CATS was everything and anything I expected of this movie. Loving the live musical, I didn't expect this movie to NOT be weird, and it 100% delivered on all of its weirdness. The music is beautiful and haunting because ALW is the MAN when it comes to music. If you go into this movie, ready to inspect every detail and wondering ""Wait.. how did this happen, or why did this happen?"" then you are very much so missing the entire essence of this show. This movie takes you into a different world and you don't leave it till the very last second. Have fun, enjoy the weird, and let the memory LIVE AGAIN. I for sure have tickets to see it again tomorrow 😸",Negative
1612,"While I think the movie did miss a few marks and had areas of improvements, there are several shining moments and IS entertaining.My two biggest complaints are: the CGI-imposed faces and Jason Derulo's Rum Tum Tugger.Overall, I was ok with the hybrid human/cat characters but the faces often looked like they were misplaced in the head, a technical glitch one would assume was fixable.Jason Derulo is very talented, but this Rum Tum Tugger really had zero charisma. I think he was cast as a result of some sort of equation that factored name recognition/ talent/cost. An unknown that ""popped off the screen"" would've been better.Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, and Judi Dench all had wonderful performances. Francesca Heyword and her character were perfect guides to the world of Jellicle cats.Taylor Swift, James Corden, and Rebel Wilson all gave good performances. Not award-winning in my view, but certainly very good for what their parts required.The rest of the main casts are relatively unknowns but all performed very well. I especially liked Laurie Davidson's Mr. Mistoffelees.I thought the lighting and cinematography was breathtaking; and the dance numbers ranged from ""just ok"" to ""pretty cool"".I've seen Cats on Broadway, at a casino, a relatively large auditorium, a local theater group, and a London Thereafter recorded stage performance filmed in the 80s or 90s, and I would rate this movie as the 2nd or 3rd most enjoyable. The Broadway , Winter Gardens, was the best and the local Theater Group was 2nd but movie was much better than the others.I think the piling on of bad reviews is unjustified and probably more of a result of a sort of mob mentality rather that of mass of movie goers who are genuinely appaled but this film.",Negative

But for the most part I understood what the director was trying to accomplish and commend him for it and actually had a good time Judi Dench Taylor Swift Idris Elba Jennifer Hudson and Company perform and emote very very well the dance sequences very well done however this was a hard project to pull off from being on Broadway......Go see the film and open your heart and maybe then you'll understand.... a very well-intentioned movie musical but simply not for everybody...",Negative
1614,I went into this movie with zero expectations and this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I've watched Gigli twice. I am part of a podcast team that talks movies so we had to watch this movie as part of our show. I can't tell you what happens in the last 2/3 of the movie because we walked out. The CGI cats are awful looking and you can't help but shake your head at all of the big names in this  box of a movie. I hope they got paid big bucks for this disaster.

1622,"Like ""Moulin Rouge,"" the movie ""Cats"" is a weird sort of fantasy movie, far, far removed from reality. ""Cats"" is definitely the lesser movie, but still the concept is interesting, the digital fur fascinating, the singing can be terrific, and the dance moves (ballet, hip hop, Fosse, and tap) are great. If dancing, singing cats isn't your thing and if you're not a cat person, best go see some other film. This one's definitely for diehard fantasy fans. Also, if cat-like people or people-like cats with digitally twitching tails and ears freak you out, then stay away.",Negative
1623,"I have submitted several reviews over the years, but, this is my first one star.I have given Cats one star due to a scene that literally made me feel nauseous (fat cat eating cockroaches).Post WWII audio/visual torture techniques were developed.

I am obsessed with musicals. I've seen Broadway shows, and movie musicals. Some are bad, but none are as bad as this movie.
I can't even form a proper review. The movie was awful. The acting was subpar. The theatre I watched it in had about forty people when the movie started. By the time it was over, there were maybe five of us left.
Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memory was the only thing I enjoyed, but damn, I would have rathered just download the song.
The CGI was awful. The costumes were so odd! Some cats wore clothes, the others didn't. Every cat was morony, it was awkward and uncomfortabe. The humour was unfunny.
Do not waste your money. It's just so so so bad. It's not even so bad, it's good. It will not become a cult classic. It is awful and always will be.",Negative
1628,I hope the adaptation would be quirky but fabulous and engaging. I love musicals! The cast was extremely promising. The set was the best thing about it.This was nightmare inducing.

1632,"Polarizing it seems
It revised the story, gave it a new viewpoint, a focal point of view that allowed it more of a sense of story than the stage show which is genuinely just a bunch of set pieces each with a self-contained story but with just the most cursory of narratives to set them within.It doesn't matter because Cats on stage is a visual, visceral spectacle, a riot of musical cats and athletic dance with it's own unique aesthetic.This was better, the addition of Victoria isn't just a good way to centre the film, Francesca Hayward's performance of her was really quite beautiful. Whenever she danced it stood out wonderfully against the overall dance style, it set her apart from the other ""cats"", which supported the narrative cleverly. Her face was quite exquisitely beautiful framed as it was by the CGI, but her facial expressiveness, that part of her acting was captivating.How can folks hate this movie for the CGI? It added animated tails and yes.... fur. Have you looked at a cat? They actually don't wear technicolour leotards. Hating this film for the fur is like hating Aliens because the Xenos have flat asses, hating Star trek because you don't like the view out of the portholes. If you can't stand CGI for it's own sake then watch the film of the stage show, for pity's sake don't pretend you weren't expecting cat people.Idris Elba did well, Judy dench was playing Judy Dench, Taylor Swift was just there for the musical number and it was a good performance - I like her better as a cat apparently. James cordon was awful and in future views of the movie I will be fast forwarding him but no surprises there. I thought Ian McKellen played age to the hilt but the character's style got lost to that. Rebel Wilson was not there to be cool or emotionally compelling and I thought played the part and the song she was given well. I wasn't keen on the part but there I take issue with Tom Holland, not Wilson.Griselda and ""Memories"" have always been the highspot of Cats for me but Jennifer Hudson took it in a new direction and I really didn't appreciate the changes. Previosly as a character Griselda has a sorrowful magnificence, a beautiful sadness, it's the point the ""story"" seems to pivot on. Hudson plays her as fearful and the cast respond to her not with sadness and pity for her fall but with spite for her condition. ""Memories"" is performed with a little of the wistful loss, but with anger and it kills the whole character for me. When the chandelier rose into the clouds, for me it wasn't with that sense of joy and redemption, it was more of a ""well, that happened"".The reviews here and elsewhere gathered a harsh and undeserved momentum, I'll be watching this movie again when I'm in the mood for dance.",Negative
1633,"I just watched Cats and after reading all these horrific views, I don't get it. It wasn't a great movie but it certainly doesn't warrant the level of vitriol that other reviewers have posted. I saw the Broadway show many years ago and I don't see why the comparisons to it are so negative. Also, I find many of the negative reviews have a similar tone and verbiage, as though they were written by a bunch of people sitting around brainstorming to see who could top each other with their insults of the movie. I actually liked the sets and costumes. I loved Dame Judy Dench as Deuteronomy and Sir Ian McKellen as Gus, the Theatre Cat. And Jennifer Hudson outdid herself once again. I actually got chills when she sang the 2nd version of Memory.",Negative
1634,"All right. It's easy to simply say this is one of the worst movies in a long time. I'll try to make a couple of constructive comments. If you've ever seen the filmed version of Hamlet with David Tennant or the filmed version of Death of a Salesman with Dustin Hoffman, that is the way Cats should have been adapted to the screen if they were going to do it live action. It should have been a filmed stage production with maybe a couple of cinematic flourishes such as some close-ups, and normal stage costumes, not CG. Or they could have made a fully animated version, that would have worked as well. Aside from all the technical errors related to scale - the cats vary in size literally from one shot to the next - and other technical errors like Judi Dench's wedding ring clearly visible because her hands weren't CG'd properly - the story itself is gibberish. I have never seen the stage production of Cats and had only heard one of the songs. I gather that when they wrote the script they tried to impose some sort of story where one had not been. They failed utterly, as this story makes absolutely no sense. That is to say, again, they simply should have adapted the exact same production to the screen and kept it simple.The failure of this movie is a really good example of how one or two ill-conceived decisions at the very beginning of pre-production can doom a project to failure no matter how hard and sincerely the actors and technicians may try to pull it together.",Negative
1635,"So bad. Just so, so very bad. The person who said this is what everyone saw in Birdbox is spot on. Avoid at all costs if you can.",Negative
1636,"Much like Venom last year, Cats is a ""worst movie of the year"" that isn't all that bad. The movie has its fair share of flaws, but the bright spots are very bright.The CGI isn't as eye bleed worthy as I thought it would be, the comedy was missplaced in some parts but in others made me chuckle, the singing was inconsistent, however, mostly good, as was the acting, and overall look of the film was decent. By far my biggest complaint is the lack of a compiling naritive. The film was unclear in what its plot was until fairly far in, and even when it did lay out its master plan I felt it was far too simple for a movie as long and as costly as this one was.What saves the movie is beautiful singing from Jennifer Hudson among others, and musical set pieces that are a joy to watch. I don't think I will re-watch this anytime soon, but I kinda glad I did at least once.",Negative
1637,"Just why? It's already bad enough, but the icing on top of this horrific, computer-generated cake is that these godforsaken abominations are called ""Jellicles"" : ( Don't see this movie, I beg of you.",Negative
1638,"Tom Hooper, best known for his Oscar-winning film version of the smash hit musical 'Les Misérables', has made an oddly mesmerising big screen version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's well known stage musical 'Cats'. With actors fully covered in what was supposed to look like realistic CGI-fur, its paper thin story and horrifying visuals are tonally and visually messy, to the extent of either disgusting you or push you into a frenzy of uncontrollable laughter.Each year, a tribe of cats called the Jellicles must decide which one will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new Jellicle life. Just thrown out of a car by her human, Victoria is the newest cat in town who is basically our eyes and ears through this strange and peculiar ceremony, that'll drag us through the streets of London.Cats is surprisingly not a boring film, to which you'll notice your eyes being glued to the screen for the full runtime. Burned into your cornea, cats with human features, jazz dancing human-hybrid cockroaches and the unzipping of furs as some sort of costume change mid-performance, will make this the most bizarre moviegoing experience of the decade, if not the century. David Cronenberg couldn't come up with something as cooked as this.With a grand range of mostly well known actors and dancers, the creators try to reach a broad audience of cinema goers that might not be familiar with the musical itself. Ballerina Francesca Hayward, making her on screen debut as pearly white kitten Victoria doesn't get a lot of lines, but impresses with her ongoing dance routines in which she literally floats (the visual effects looked so unfinished, you can notice a visible gap between their feet and the computer generated floor) through every scene. Oscar-winning actress/singer Jennifer Hudson plays glamour cat Grizabella, who's made some wrong decisions in the past and ended up as a sad and lonely stray carrying her wealth and fortune with her, hoping she gets to sing her song to impress the Jellicles, and fit in once again. Hudson, who's fur looked surprisingly combed, gets to perform the best known song on the soundtrack 'Memory' and so saves her own career by proving she's actually better than this. One can only hope this boosts her career like Dreamgirls once did for her.What's utterly frightening, is the fact all these other actors are giving it their all, making it even more of an out-of-body experience. Judi Dench breaking the fourth wall, by bringing a monologue to the audience in how to address a cat, will for sure make the entire audience crack up in roaring laughter. Rebel Wilson does what Rebel Wilson does, while R&B-singer Jason Derulo tries a British accent, and fails. Recently anointed ""performer of the decade"" Taylor Swift's part is narratively useless, especially when her character completely disappears from the stage, without any explanation.Of course the songs and music are as odd as the musical itself, with some weird synthesiser tune as part of the main theme. But one can't deny some of the songs are joyfully upbeat and catchy. Unfortunately, these songs are almost identical to the stage musical versions and aren't done justice by actors who can't really sing. Accompanied by some great production design, some acts look truly spectacular - such as a bedroom and dining room scene in which everything is larger than life. But Hooper thought bigger is better and destroys almost every scene with the overuse of bad-CGI, blurring what should look crisp and fighting Disney's ""live action"" version of The Lion King for the award of biggest cat-astrophe. Cats is claw-fully ambitious and doesn't kitten around. This tail of forgiveness and redemption had lots of paw-sibilities, but un-fur-tunately is nothing more than a hiss-terical fail of incomprehensible proportions.",Negative

The CGI looks like it was done by a drunk film student. The cinematography is awful and covers up the choreography (the only thing the movie maybe had going for it). There's a cut like every 2 seconds and it is way too zoomed in half the time. Even the music with all the celebrity voices and talent behind it, is bland at best. Also the singing and sound mixing is done in a way that you can barely understand the lyrics, which is important given that the movie is ENTIRELY SINGING. Yeah, that's right, there is no dialogue in this movie, and you can only half understand the singing. It doesn't even matter, considering the movie has like, no story. There is nothing, and I mean NOTHING good about this movie. Don't see it.Love Musicals? Don't watch this. The music isn't good, and the choreography is covered up. The story is awful. I wouldn't even listen to the music on Youtube. Watch ANY other musical movie. I like musicals myself. But this? No.Like Cats, the musical? Don't watch this. I've never watched Cats, but based off of what I hear people like about Cats, this takes away anything you could've liked about Cats (choreography is covered up, costuming is gone cause its all CGI, and music is bleh)Think it'll be funny to riff on? No. Don't. Do anything else. Don't make the same mistake I did. Go out for dinner with a friend. Take a nice stroll. Play video games. You could stay in bed all day for all I care.

Real criticism: They cut a whole scene and some characters. The new song beautiful ghosts, seemed really shoved in. Added scenes, like on Growltiger's boat, were incredibly silly. Theater people say the choreography was changed. On the plus side, I loved the colorful neon 1930s London setting. I loved the synthesizers in the score. I loved the weird illogical moments, they were surreal and mesmorized me. I'm more than happy to go see something weird while everyone else is pushing out formulaic ""safe"" stuff. As for the look of the cats I had no problem with it, and frankly, was more than happy to see Idris Elba's dancing silhouette. It was no more weird than the Cowardly lion in the Wizard of Oz. Get off your high horse and go see this if you just want to have cheeky good fun.",Negative
1655,"Ok, Cats is not everyone's favourite musical. It never has been and never will be, but all those people scoring it just a one! Come on people, give credit where it is due. Jennifer Hudson can sing, but maybe her rendition of 'Memory' this time round was not the best. Idris Elba was spot on as McAvity, and Taylor Swift linked up nicely with him for their number. But the showstopper was Skimbleshanks... making it a tap dance, worked so well, and the whole dance crew joined in to make this a memorable routine. And I quite liked James Corden's number: visually it worked beautifully.OK the sets were not great, but I have yet to see a production of Cats where it has been good. It's just that type of show. And Francesca Hayward was charming and beautiful to watch throughout. Nobody seemed to notice these things. It's still worth watching and with a cast like this, yes, definitely!",Negative
1656,"I mean it's not life altering. In a good or a bad way. I didn't hate it, but then again, The Wiz was my favorite movie as a child.",Negative
1657,"Eek it was ok.
Is prob the best review i can say.
Whats the point of taking a stage show and making a blockbuster movie that looks like a stage show. Every scene looks like a cardboard or cgi backdrop. So its hard to buy-in to the feline world. It all looks fake. Its all so dull
And feels like a three hour movie rather than a two hour movie. Nothing really happens. laurie Davidson & Francesca Hayward shine out though despite all the high profile cast. Francesca as a cat is strangely arousing.
Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella has a house raising moment. But Mckellan, Dench,Derulo, Elba, Winstone are all wasted here in un-memorable parts in a to be honest un-memorable movie. To be frank, It needed Sir Tim Rice (as do all Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber productions) 3/10",Negative
1658,"I'll give people; it's seriously strange, and the effects between cat and human are super uncanny. But it's actually not as bad as everyone says on here.
Tone down the expectations and just expect to be entertained.",Negative
1659,"Apparently I watched something different than the other reviewers. I love the stage musical. This was a fun, star filled cast adaptation of the theatre production. Well done and creative with lots of cat antics and quirky touches to the different applicants.",Negative
1660,I am a musical theatre person and love musicals. The sets and dancing and songs/singing were beautiful. I went to see this movie with my friend and we were nothing going into it expecting to laugh at how bad it was and we ended up actually enjoying it. The thing I have to say that brought the score down was the fact that the faces are so weird and the cats have human hands and not actual hands and also the plot was really weird. Other than that the movie was actually pretty good!,Negative
1661,"It is not a masterpiece, it doesn't make much sense and most scenes are just too ridiculous and convoluted to appeal a wide audience but, come on people, it's a musical about cats having a party to decide who goes to the ""afterlife""... it sure is no Citizen Kane but in order to enjoy it you have to put your rational mind aside.",Negative
1662,I honestly don't get the hate. I only knew some info about the stage play and this is exactly why I expected. IDK if most people just didn't know what this was gonna be? It isn't a great musical. But there are definitely worse movies out there,Negative
1663,Well.... it was painfully long for such a short movie. The numbers were good. Taylor Swift was great as was Rebel Wilson. It just needed maybe some more excitement or substance or something. It just didn't move quick enough for me to enjoy it. I kept wondering when and wishing for it to be over. The acting was great. This was all down to the script and editing.,Negative
1664,"Movie ""Cats"" is a best musical movie I ever see. Everything was just perfect, and the weakest link (for me) was Judi Dench singing. Yes, I noticed that in some scene cats and the rest of the scenography is not in correct ratio, but that is really all that was kind a bad. Everyhing else was PERFECT!
First of all ensemble! The singing was FANTASTIC! Dancing fantastic! Every single role was ferfect! Jennifer Hudson give new dimension singing Memory. I am not fan of Taylor Swift, but she was fantastic! James Corden, ah this role is made for him. Rebel Wilson - fantastic!
I really don't understand what made people write so many bad opinion. You can like, or don't like movie, but to put it in 100 worst movies ever made!? I don't think so! I really like to movie. Thank you for making this movie.",Negative
1665,"I am amazed that music talents like Taylor and Jennifer would sink this low in their carears as to join in with a complete tone-deaf cast of misc actors, just to be in a ""musical"" on screen?Doint the same roles at Broadway would have been much more logical and carear smart (imho).But if you like to watch a vulgar Rebel spread her legs wide and lick her tail, you will get your fetishes all fullfilled.It is more painfull to watch the CGI effects in this movie, than even rewatch old episodes of Star Trek from the 80s or 90s.It is a compliment to give this film a 1 star ranking, but 0 is not possible to give.",Negative
1666,"A nonsensical plot, the worst CGI I've seen in years and the worst scene (the Rebel Wilson with cockroaches on a cake) I can recall in a movie. The film simply should have been thrown out at the drawing board stage. It really does deserve every one star review it's receiving. The only positive was the performance of Francesca Hayward who was seriously let down by everything else from production, direction, CGI and other performances from the A list cast. Haywood deserved more but it's an absolute mess of a film.",Negative
1667,"It seems there's an actual consensus for once on IMDB, everyone hates this movie and rightfully so. It's terrible and nobody wanted it, much like the latest Star Wars. Avoid this at all costs, or at least try some hallucinogens, but I'm pretty sure you'd have a bad trip.",Negative
1668,"I almost feel like this movie is some cruel joke. there's no need to even really review it. this movie a waste of time, money, talent; everything. it will just depress you at how desperate hollywood is for a cash grab, and how they think we're all mindless consumers.this movie had one good thing, it made me realize we should be demanding better movies, it's our money we're spending and this is what they expect us to purchase?",Negative

1674,1 hour and 50minutes of my life I will now be getting back. Even my children were disappointed. For the cast of big names I was expecting something spectacular but instead it was one of the worse films I have ever seen,Negative
1675,"Superb production values, great performances and mesmerizing dance routines, but the lack of story and weak editing spoil it. There's a great variety of songs and types of music but the way they join together results in a jumbled mishmash of genres and styles which is further exacerbated by the nonsensical lyrics. The acting and celebrity performances are good, but they are a bit jarring at times and although it's a very magical and impressive production, I was a bit bored by the end.",Negative
1676,Im more entertained by reading this reviews. im watching this movie while i write this. ive always hated cats and nothing has changed. if anything i hate them more.,Negative
1677,"Yes, it's weird, I completely agree. Although everything different is not necessarily bad. The CGI makes the actors look alien but kept their familiar faces. I must admit (am I the only one?) that it created a fascinating somewhat creepy attractiveness. The choreography is different from what you have seen before but it fits the cat theme perfectly. If all the critics would answer truthfully, they simply cannot say anything negative about the quality of the dancers. If you have seen the earlier musical version of Cats, you can see the nice parallels they draw. I would give it a 7 if it weren't for the very thin story line and the mediocre singing which almost made me leave after the first 45 minutes of the movie. So, I will eventually rate the movie with a 6. It was entertaining to see something familiar repacked in a weird setting that would fit well in an incoherent dream that I can only describe in this probably incoherent review.",Negative
1678,"In the ongoing war against human intelligence, this film qualifies as a war crime. The filmmakers and actors are war criminals. They go on trial at the Hague. And then grow old in a Jellical prison. Thankfully, they only have ONE life.",Negative
1679,Can't think of any positives. A blemish on the actors' CV. Laughable CGI and effects,Negative
1680,"I blame myself. I don't know what I was expecting, this movie is just wrong and weird and I couldn't really see the point of bringing all these A-lists together for this disaster.",Negative

Effects are looking cheap and horrible.
Film itself is simply boring. Not entertaining at all.",Negative

1683,"The worst dumpster fire of a movie I've ever seen in theaters. Not even National Treasure Dame Judi Dench could save this film from the stain it has put upon the world. My friend and I went knowing it would be bad so we had a few drinks before. Not even my 3 glasses of wine could delude me into thinking it's a good film. The CGI was a joke, the special effects laughable, the acting was terrible and over the top (I expect this was the doing of Tom Hooper) and to top it all off every chorus had stray notes and no cohesive harmony. Nothing about this film was salvageable, a total wreck. EVERY MOMENT WAS CRINGEWORTHY! I literally cringed ON my cringes! What baffles me is that there were about 50 other viewers in the audience and no one walked out, no one shouted at the screen about how bad it was, no one besides us even cackled at the absurdity of the whole stanky mess.",Negative
1684,So disappointed and No sense of humour compared to the live musical. Slow songs went on for far too long (or so it felt) and I honestly struggled to stay awake. Storyline was slow and I'm still confused what exactly the story is.,Negative
1685,"I love this movie! The songs, the dancing, the creativity. It brings the theatre to my living room!It is disappointing to see the bad reviews and some of the actors bad mouthing the movie because of its reviews. The reviews about the CGI and the fact they have normal hands make no sense...I'm not sure what they expected....paws?? (Which were not in the theatre production)It's a great portrayal of the theatrical show! Watch with the mindset of going to the theatre rather than watching a film.",Negative
1686,"I am not a steady user reviewer in IMDB. But felt the need to review this one.
As most of us, before going to watch it, I checked the rating and reviews in IMDB.
Wow, how many horrible reviews it has received.
So, I went there, prepared to watch one of the worst films I have ever tried.This was not the case though. The film is not the average ""Hollywood"" musical with a blend of dialogues and songs. It is almost just songs. Be prepared for that.
I have not seen the theatre play, so I cannot compare. But found this film quite good. It is not a fast paced movie. It is not intended to.
After the half , it becomes more emotional and captivating.
I think the movie delivers what it is intended to: a ""theatrical"" experience of a musical. Relying more on the music and lyrics, than complex dialogues, to transfer the ideas and emotions to the viewer.
Succeeded with me.",Negative
1687,"This will change your whole perspective of view when you look at at your own cats. I tried so hardly to enjoy this movie with my Friskies Special Edition Popcorn and my Fancy Feast Soda, but my brain just turned into a giant hairball. CGI HumanCats should be censored!",Negative
1688,"Smoke a little weed, put the mind in neutral, and forget that the collars around the kitties' necks have a tendency to move just slightly slower than the necks themselves. Dont ask why one cat is stripping off her skin to show more fur underneath - and certainly dont ask what her outer garment would be made of. Really, just dont do it.It never ceases to amaze me when a director takes essentially bulletproof material like this and says, ""Hey, let's see what I can do to really screw it up."" Still, it had some nice moments (that lasted maybe a few seconds apiece) and some intriguing ideas (that lasted even shorter time). The background were, in the main, charming, but clearly meant for another movie altogether. Maybe a French musical with Gene Kelly. But not this one.",Negative
1689,"Shocking effects, pathetic editing, weird casting and just feels and looks like it was made by amateurs or for a bet. Really bad. Avoid at all costs.",Negative
1690,This was just.... Holy crap where to start... This film was so bad I think a visit to the dignitas clinic would be much more fun then this abomination.,Negative
1691,Watching this film caused my airway to constrict and my skin to break out in hives. Had to walk out and sneak into the theater showing jumanji instead. $10 better spent on paying someone to punch you in the jaw.,Negative
1692,"I'm not sure I can be as creative with my review as others. I would just say DON'T DO IT!! Releasing a version with improved CGI will NOT make this less of a flop. It's tried to be arty, but is just terribly freaky. Crying shame! We left 45 mins in, as did 6 others. Wish I'd gone to see Star Wars with the hubby instead.",Negative
1693,"Basically, don't bother, it only got a 1 rating because I couldn't pick a 0.
There is no plot to be seen, and I can't believe the cast list signed up to this film because they didn't make it anymore watchable.
If you have cat or can borrow one watch that for 2 hours instead of this film, because it will be far more enjoyable.
WARNING. remember you cannot unsee this film once you've watched it.",Negative
1694,"I don't know why this movie has such a poor rating, perhaps it's because the people that watched it weren't big musical fans or had never seen the original cats. But I personally think that this movie was done way better than the original stage production. The CGI is beautiful. The music is so much more catcher than the original production, the scenes are beautiful, and it has an amazing cast. Biggest thing of all, this is SO much easier to understand. Bravo!",Negative
1695,"I have to admit, I do not understand how everyone hates this movie. I'm not quite saying that this is a gem, but despite some issues, it's actually quite an alright movie!First, there's a point, some kind of message simplistic as it might be, which is more than I can say for most movies of the current decade. Second, the cast can actually sing, and dance. Which has most certainly not been the case with some of the most popular musicals of the recent era (La La Land comes to mind).And while I'm sure the cat costumes were not for everyone, I don't believe the ratings here in any way reflect the quality of the movie.",Negative
1696,"Taking theatre productions and turning them into movies, with few exceptions, has always been a disaster. This is no different.",Negative

1698,To ruin such a famous play is damm right shameful and a tragedy of cinema.,Negative
1699,I was so let down by movie presentation of cats. The costumes were amazing. There was a star studded cast with some unfamiliars. Some of the songs were slightly different than I remembered them. All in all the movie was just ok. I was disappointed. Could have just made it a Netflix movie.,Negative
1700,"Absolutely terrible! My wife and I decided we would ignore the bad reviews and see it, and form our own opinion. What a mistake! Whoever casted this movie should be confined to a 6×6 room with 50 cats and a huge basket of catnip!",Negative
1701,"It's a musical, so it has dancing and singing, but that's the only thing it has. It's just a waste of time. No humor, no action, no excitement. It's a long introduction of characters that disappear 5 minutes after they are introduced. It could have been so much more, but they chose to make it boring as hell.",Negative
1702,"So last night for my moms birthday despite the bad reviews we went to see ""cats"" at the cinema. As huge fans of the musical and having seen the stage show we had to see it.
Well the reviews are correct, it was horrendous! It bothers me people who havent seen the stage show may now boycott it if they watch this abomination of film. I was concerned that moving from theatre to screen the story may loose its charm.... it lost everything on screen including the audience as some people literally walked out of the cinema.
Even the basics were out.
Idris Elba played the infamous Macavity... now for those of you unfamiliar in the song Macavity a feral cat and is specifically described s the following :-
ginger cat
he's very tall and thin
eyes are sunken in
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed....
They literally sing these lyrics as a beefy sleek brown kitty version of Elba dances around the stage...Wtf! Not to mention the repitching of the songs, poor CGI and inconsistent scale to every day objects ...just to name a few things
Absolutely terrible.... I wish I could unsee it I really do.
I have come back home and have the immediate urge to watch the recorded version of the stage show just to remind myself how much I lovd it and try to forget the horror that tortured my eyes and ears last night.
I've only rated this a 2* as opposed to a 1* as I think very young kids may enjoy it... but that's not a big compliment as that audience still picks their nose and thinks peppa pig is an on screen marvel.",Negative
1703,I have always loved Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats and loved seeing it come to life on the big screen. The movie follows the musical and has one new song that is a wonderful addition. The dancing in this movie is AMAZING! Judy Dench is fabulous as a cat and Jennifer Hudson steals the show with her rendition of Memory.,Negative
1704,"I liked it. Seems most did not. I wonder how many of these saw the stage production. I was looking forward to seeing movie after enjoying the stage production. That was a hit, though plot was thin and somewhat confusing. With the pandemic and the movie not streaming on platforms I had, I did not see it at first and heard and saw all the rotten reviews. I still had to see it for myself. I was expecting to dislike it based on reviews. I was uncomfortable at first with ""more realistic"" cat ""costumes"", animated and the ear twitching. There were characters played well by great actors who could not sing. The plot was thin of you just look at from point A to B, without looking at its meaning. Hint: it's not about cats, but about us. But the movie actually made what was happening much clearer to the audience . Outside of the few who acted well, but could not sing, the entertainment value, the singing and dancing and the music by Andrew Lloyd Weber was fantastic! The acting, singing and dancing by lead Francesca Hayward was phenomenal. Most of music and dancing were very good. The tap dancer was excellent! At the end I was moved. They could have done with the last treatise on how to treat cats. Were there flaws.? Yes. Similar flaws were in the hit stage production. The virtual costumes admittedly turned me off at first. But I got used to it and I found it genuinely entertaining and moving despite that. Perhaps others spent too much time being literal and missed the heart of it. Or perhaps they could get past the ""costumes"". The difference in shoes had to do with the type of dancing being done. The white tennis shoes did bug me until I saw the dance being performed. I wanted the give it more stars based on overall enjoyment of it, but aforementioned flaws caused me to have to go with 6. I did enjoy it!",Negative
1705,Do not watch this film even as a joke the worst film of the decade by far.,Negative
1706,"I was excited to see this for the music, dance and favorite actors. What a let down this was! I'm shocked that the producers thought this was good. From this time forward I'll wait a month irv2 before paying good $$$ to be a movie.",Negative

1708,"I very rarely, if ever, leave reviews, but I felt compelled. Sadly, for non-Star wars fans there's little on offer this Christmas.
I've fancied seeing Cats at the theatre so what better than to watch the big screen version, finely honed to perfection?
Style was of the Polar Express variety, which can work well. The effect was poorly realised.
The opening music was a bit rubbish 70's electronic, but I'm a child of the era so the music must get better, right? Sadly not. Surely the music in the stage show isn't so bad is it? I love a good musical.... and this wasn't.
James Cordon noted for his lack of acting ability. No surprise there.
The actors were heavily made up so hopefully can distance themselves from the whole ordeal and pretend it wasn't themselves playing the part.
I was stuck in the middle of an aisle so thought that sleep would save me. Unfortunately the poor music score kept me awake. I had to suffer the dreadfully poor acting and singing.
Curiously, some in the audience found humour in some of the lines and were laughing. I can only think that they've seen the stage play, so it's something familiar to them. I could find nothing amusing. I kept waiting for the story music and acting to improve. It didn't.
Half way through when I thought all hope was lost, my wife thankfully saved the day and said ""this is awful, can we please go"".

They could have changed it to make it appeal to the masses which would have yielded a better profit and review. But I'm personally glad they stayed true to what it is.",Negative
1713,"It's strange how critics attacked this movie... No wonder, but it's far from as horrible as they claim.Certain musical numbers extrapolate, the effects are silly, choreographies, mainly of the main actress forcing ballet steps, which go against the idea of the film.However, overall I thought it was an average movie... Good fun.Don't believe in such low grades. I have certainly seen much worse things that have had more benevolence from critics.",Negative
1714,"Worst movie I've seen in 2019 so far and I watched Good Boys. Horrible casting. Horrible choreography. Horrible cinematography and HORRENDOUS CGI.

If it's not a Disney musical, don't make it. Aladdin was bad enough. Thank you for your time.",Negative

I wasn't just suffering some sort of delusion.Yes, the CGI on the cat people could be disturbing at times... but once you got used to the whole idea of human faces with cat ears... most of the actors looked quite good.The songs are mostly great... the performers voices are fantastic... the set pieces are imaginative (though the dancing cockroaches may have been a little too much)... the attention to detail is really quite impressive.How on earth did this movie become so hated????Taylor Swift's song is one of the best movie sequences of all time... and the Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer sequence isn't far off...and where else are you going to see a tap dancing cat?",Negative

I went prepared to see why everyone thought it was so awful but I must have watched a different movie because I found it mostly enjoyable. I think the problem is most are going to just hate on the movie for some reason. If you go looking for something find wrong with the film, sure, you will find plenty of items. But why go spend $10 on a ticket for that. I personally go to be entertained and that is what I was delivered. The songs are pretty good (my fave is Mr. Mestofelees) and the dancing is sublime. James Corden and Rebel Wilson weren't my favorite and Judi Dench was not a great casting choice but the rest of the cast was great. Jennifer's high notes will give you chills, Taylor nails MaCavity, and Francesca was exquisite. Yes, the CGI was not great, but is was no worse than The Hobbit, and I didn't see everyone so up in arms about that. Go see this for what it is and have a great time!!",Negative
1725,"But oh my GOD was this a pointless movie!
It's 2 hours of poorly animated cats dancing and singing as a way to introduce themselves, all as a ploy to move onto the ""Heavylayer side"" which is appointed by the Deuteronomy (Judi Dench).Music was unmemorable (though ""Memory"" is quite decent, props to Jennifer Hudson for that), the choreography was nice and there were some pretty shots. But it doesn't make up for the fact that the storyline is pointless, the conflict was basically non-existent, and the humour is just so unfunny thanks to James Corden (though that is probably me being bias because I just can't stand the man) and Rebel Wilson, who has not played a different character since being introduced to the big screen, and her trope of ""Oh I fall over a lot and it's funny because I'm fat"" is so overdone it just makes me angry. I pray that she will actually do something different with her roles in the future or she may never be able to get out of that increasingly deeper hole.I know this has all been said before, but I got so mad at this movie that I feel it needed to be said again",Negative

I'll admit that I've seen the stage show twice (neither which were my idea) and it's not my thing. It's interesting to see the makeup and junkyard design for something that's still abstract and light on story. In fact, all I can say about it is that it centers around a tribe of cats and several of them do a song and dance to be chosen for another life. And given how it's sung through its entirety, that's either going to make it or break it for most.I know that Cats had been one of Broadway's longest running shows and continues to play at a lot of community theaters and touring groups. Naturally, this was also something that had been attempted as a movie. Cats is already hard to do on stage and would never be easy to translate. I know that when the first trailers popped up, it got a lot of negative feedback for its choice of CGI animation on the human-like cats. Does Cats translate to the big screen?A white kitten Victoria (played by Francesca Hayward) is abandoned in an alleyway by its owner and is discovered by a group of street cats called the ""Jellicles"". Some include a magician Mr. Mistoffelees (played by Laurie Davidson) and Munkustrap (played by Robbie Fairchild). They take a liking to Victoria and take her to the Jellicle Ball where they say that their leader will select one for the chance to be taken to the Heaviside Layer and be granted another life. Brown cat Macavity (played by Idris Elba) badly wants the honor and will try to sabotage the other cats.Storywise, this is all you need to know. Like the stage show, the rest consists of other cats singing and dancing their songs on why they should be chosen. Such cats include Bustopher Jones (played by James Corden), Rum Tum Tugger (played by Jason Delrulo), Gus the Theatre Cat (played by Ian McKellen), Jennyanydots (played by Rebel Wilson) and Bombalurina (played by Taylor Swift). Also in the mix, and ostrasized by the other cats is Grizabella (played by Jennifer Hudson). Who will Old Deuteronomy (played by Judi Dench) chose?So who was Cats made for? It seems like that only fans of the stage show are going to get much out of Cats. The rest, including myself, get something that may have a lot of ambition, but comes out in a giant mess. I'll start by saying that there's little focus on story (again, like the Broadway show). I'm normally fine with a movie that's more loose with story, but you better make sure the characters are at least interesting. The ironic thing is even with a lot of characters getting songs, I know very little about them. Many of them have few scenes (sometimes only one) and the main cat herself, Victoria isn't that interesting.It made me realize that the stage show broke the forth wall and took the audience on an abstract journey. I kind of wished the movie would have done something similar. It tries by having a cat fill in the role of the audience, but that gives us without a character to latch onto.Let's talk about the CGI. I knew that something different was going to be done for the movie, but along with it not looking finished, the human-like design is so freakish, that I could see children having nightmares. It's ugly, gross and I hate looking at it for nearly two hours!As a musical, some of the songs like ""Rum Tum Tugger"", ""Bustopher Jones"" and ""Jellicle Songs for Jellecle Cats"" are entertaining. The rest are fine, but nothing that I'm going to remember. I didn't even care for the way ""Memory"" was rearranged, making small moments big and vice versa.In addition to the set design, it is at least impressive to look at. But even as a movie that's so bad that's good, I still can't recommend it as its still too boring.I'll give this two stage cats out of ten. I'm not sure what Warner Brothers was thinking with the story, visuals, music, and even overall concept. Cats doesn't deserve a second life and let's just leave it at that.",Negative
1732,"Just don't, literally the worst thing I have to experienced.",Negative
1733,"Excellent movie, beautiful, gorgeous, filled with fantasy and emotion, it does exactly what a movie should do, entertain the audience. I loved it. I've seen it three times and I liked it every time. Special effects are perfect, the singing and dancing the same. Don't listen to the bullies who trash this movie, give it a shot and I promise you'll love it.",Negative
1734,"Don't understand the super bad reviews and hate for this movie. I have never watched the musical so had zero expectations. I thought the movie was quite entertaining and a fun watch for the whole family. My 5 year old nephew suddenly got out of his seat and started dancing when Rum Tum Tugger was doing his thing. The kids got a good laugh out of the silly antics of Jennyanydots played by Rebel Wilson, who was essentially playing herself in all her other movies. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Rebel Wilson, Inthink she's hilarious! Absolutely loved Ian McKellan's performance as Gus and his presentation piece to contend for the Jellicle Choice. CG was able to gift this movie with realistic feline twitches and movements for the actors.I've seen some reviews claiming there is no plot. It's quite simple, you got a bunch of cats who are contending to be selected as the chosen Jellicle to be whisked away to a new life in Heaviside Layer. Where's Heaviside Layer? Who knows? It's just some place a bunch of cats made up. Ultimately this is a movie about - well Cats! And the mystical , magical lives they lead.",Negative
1735,"Never saw the play but just saw the movie. I was in shock. Kept waiting to find out what the roar ""or meow"" was all about. The tunes weren'r catchy. The lyrics weren't clever and although Jennifer Hudson was good, i thought Betty Buckley sang ""Memories"" like no one else. It was like the Emperor's new clothes. No one wants to admit he's naked. No on wants to admit that Cats sucks.",Negative
1736,Dont waste your time and money. I was like yeah i give it a chance... and fell asleep! Its really boring....,Negative
1737,I just dragged my husband to try and see for myself how it could be so bad with that cast but seriously cringeworthy and cant understand how any director or producer could sit watching this back still allowed it to be released 🙈🙈🙈.,Negative
1738,"This is such a weird film that has a lot of flaws and makes me question its existence at times, the CGI used is just awful the cats hands weren't even catlike at all making it look like the actors were just wearing some weird cat suits. The story is a jumbled mess that makes no sense and is barely coherent and makes me think if they took out the 20 minutes worth of celebrity cameos they could have created a decent enough story. This film like Les Miserables uses lyrics instead of dialogue but in this instance it just doesn't work. Most of the 2nd act was extremely boring and had me checking my watch, and I think impatient viewers will leave the theatre if they go to see it because of how boring it is.However I don't think its a complete dumpster fire, the songs (even though they were adapted from the original play) were nice to listen to especially Taylor Swifts song, also Jennifer Hudson has a part at the end which is quite nice and showed some promise but the pay off wasn't quite as good as what it should have been as they spent too much time messing around with the plot instead of developing a worthwhile arc for her character. I though that Idris Elbas character was interesting enough as well and thought most of his scenes were a nice distraction from some of the garbage shown. The production design was also very pretty and nice to look at giving the characters a nice background setting.Overall Cats is a poor movie and has some complete garbage in it like its absolutely awful use of CGI and presenting one of the most messiest stories put to film this year but it did have enough moments to keep me watching until the end.",Negative
1739,Lmao I am not even going to talk about it. This movie was so horrible that its giving me nightmares.,Negative
1740,A terrible movie. Everything is so wrong with the film. It is really bad. It feels so off and poorly made.,Negative
1741,"I saw Cats on stage over 30 years ago and enjoyed the music but thought it was a weird story. My expectations were low going into the theater this morning and when it was over, my friend and I just laughed at how truly horrid it was. The CGI is beyond bad and Taylor Swift needs to NEVER act again. Seriously, she was the worst, her accent was painful to listen to. The only redeeming part of the movie was Jennifer Hudson and her big number. The ending was laughable to say the least. The sad thing is there was so much talent in this movie and it was just wasted on cheesy CGI and painful to watch cat moves. Tom Hooper, you should ashamed of yourself",Negative
1742,Ok loads of people hate this but there is no CONFLICT,Negative
1743,"Fans of the Broadway musical will enjoy the film adaptation of Cats. The film is beautifully choreographed, well cast, and gorgeously set. The writers did a better job of explaining the storyline than the stage production. If you hate musicals or are just watching Cats to hate on it, maybe find something better to do with your time?",Negative
