0,"When I go to a Jurassic Park movie, I want something above all else-hyper realistic dinosaurs in cool environments, seeing them frolic in natural habitat, defend territory, battle other dinos for dominance, hunt humans, and the like. From the opening island scene with the brachiosaurus to the T-Rex reveal in the rainstorm, dinosaurs were front and center in the original Jurassic Park, inspiring a sense of grandeur and awe. The dinosaurs were what mattered, and everything else was peripheral-even the plot to get off the island. We all wanted another glimpse of the T-Rex, or were anxious to discover where the raptors were lurking.So that was the first one. Now in this sixth installment, not only are dinosaurs relegated to a commercialized product that's seen on every tv screen in the movie, but they're demoted below the humans, genetics, and even mutated locusts in terms of importance. In a two and a half hour movie, one would expect dinosaurs to fill almost half that time, and yet they pale in screen time comparison to all the human characters. Instead, the director tried to insert cameos of the legacy characters in forced interactions and honestly cringey dialogue, shifting the focus away from the real meaning in the Jurassic Park franchise-awe for dinosaurs. The wonder is now gone.I have given it five stars in respect for the franchise and the limited appearances of some of my favorite dinosaurs, but I'm sad to see that the director forgot what made Jurassic Park so special in the first place.",Notr
1,"I loved Michael Chrichton's books and the Jurassic Park series, and was in awe while watching Jurassic World and the first half of fallen kingdom. Some of the sequences are so memorable that I have rewatched the movies many times.But the Dominion doesn't have any meaning. There is no resolution for what the main question raised in the ending of the last movie- whether mankind can coexist with dinosaurs.Most of the sequences such as the Malta one, Claire ejecting from the plane thinking that wud be safer when they show her to be in more danger than the other two together, dodgson stopping their escape in the train and exposing his asset to dinosaurs in the mines, and Grant, Sattler and Malcolm acting so secretive to steal the DNA when you can't understand what wud happen if Dodgson caught them.Finally, apart from seeing Blue in the wild, none of the dinosaurs made any impact other than being props. It cud have been any creatures other than dinosaurs chasing these guys, and it would have made no difference.Finally, there was no scope for Chris Pratt in the movie to shine through.Disappointing script and useless antagonist- everything seemed contrived and unnatural; I still don't get why Claire fell into a rainforest while the other two fell on a frozen lake and still found Claire later. And what were locusts doing in a dinosaur movie????",Notr
2,"This movie consists mostly of us watching previously known characters doing whatever theyre doing now, meandering nowhere plot wise, while getting in random tight spots . For some reason they believed fans want to see a repeat of 1st movie and its characters instead of a new quality story and interesting content. Also EVERY SINGLE tight spot they find themselves in with dinosaurs is same formula.Its always exactly as it has been in every Jurassic film. Big problem all of a sudden, slow moving dino watching someone or breathing around them, then dino gives chase, uff! They barely escaped but escape they did!It is so dull and predicatable.Meanwhile we meet two new types of characters, a) those who are just inherently evil b) those who do evil stuff but are really good and moral. You can tell them apart easily by looking at what theyre wearing and whether its a rich straight white guy.The story is dumb and their evil plan so on the nose it is humorous. Zero imagination when writing the script. The length of it fits on half a napkin.After 80% of the movie is finished and we have gone over the revisiting our ""favourite"" Jurassic characters and our classic Jurassic scenes phase, the predictable ending occurs.And you realize the movie was as a wonderful and full of quality content as a dino fart.",Notr
3,"It's just amazing that no dinosaur hasn't bitten it off yet. In what promises to be the conclusion to the series, all the main cast members of the previous shows are here. ""Alan Grant....... Ellie Sattler"", I actually liked the new characters. DaWanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie better than the old ones - they are the only ones that come out of this unscathed. The special effects are, as expected, first class although really? A Gigilomopoloposaurus??? - they just keep getting bigger (the dinosaurs AND the names). Not sure that it's worth the Hollywood Blvd/Times Sq ticket prices ($20+) , but it's an okay way to spend a summer afternoon. I think tho, I'd wait til next weekend when the crowds will be 65% less.",Notr
4,This movie was so utterly predictable it was a little painful. Luckily the nostalgia nods were sprinkled throughout and mostly not forced. You can tell they tried to have some funny one-liners which fell flat a lot of the time. They need to take some notes from Marvel on those. The CGI and action was as good as you'd expect and offered favorable intensity. The story itself was somewhat lazy IMO. Did I mention it was totally predictable? I left the theater going...meh.,Notr
5,"I will say this for Colin Trevorrow: unlike other Hollywood writers/directors, who seem to be actively spiteful towards the classic sagas they are writing sequels to, when Trevorrow says he is a fan of Jurassic Park, I believe him.That's why Jurassic World Dominion feels, for good and for ill, like the world's most expensive fan film, cramming in nearly every dinosaur known to man and every character, meme and in-joke from the previous five movies (button up your shirt, Malcom! Get your hat, Grant! Oh look, Nedry's old Barbasol can!).I'm betting that if the great Pete Postlethwaite had not passed away we would have gotten Roland Tembo rappelling from a helicopter to shoot an Oviraptor in the face.The movie is at least twenty minutes too long - Hollywood seems incapable to make a non-bloated blockbuster today, even Bond movies have the running time of The Thin Red Line - and it doesn't have a shred of the wit and intelligence of my beloved first Jurassic Park, but I did like a few set-pieces (the Therizinosaurus, the frozen lake...) and it's always nice to see the awesome Sam Neill back, so I guess the fan bait worked to an extent.5,5/10.",Notr
6,"Bad script, bad acting, stupid story, a new dinosaur every 5 minutes, too long, no suspense, Chris Pratt doing the hand thing, $160 million dollar budget for this, so many pointless dinosaur fights AND you took 2 and a half hours to tell me this garbage story.Frankly embarrassing to everyone involved.",Notr
7,"Was it perfect? No. Was it fun? Absolutely! There will be a lot of things people will pick apart this movie for. I for one didn't mind it. It was a solid closing chapter to the Jurassic World trilogy. It was a nice balance with the newer stars and the OGs. A lot of ""hey, I know you from such and such"". When the casts get combined I was so happy. I love my OG Jurassic Park crew. They were my main reason for being excited and I wasn't disappointed in that regard. A lot of fun sequences really helped keep me entertained. It could've been a bit shorter but I'm still happy with what I got from it. Go in to have fun. It won't do you any good going in expecting a masterpiece. Plus it has a ton of baby dinosaurs, they were sooooo cute!",Notr
8,"""Jurassic World Dominion"" is a movie I genuinely don't know how to feel about. Parts of me really liked it, and other parts were very critical and disappointed in it. It's one I might have to see again to really firm up my opinion. Regardless... I had fun with this movie. I just want to make it clear it is nowhere near as bad as some people say it is; it's not perfect, but it is still lots of fun! However this is definitely the weakest in the ""Jurassic World"" trilogy, but I am someone who loved ""Jurassic World"" and for the most part really liked ""Fallen Kingdom"". I have to say, I did like this more than the original sequels to ""Jurassic Park"", and I thought this did serve as a nice finale to the series, even if it has changed substantially.I think my biggest issue here was how different it was from what I wanted and expected to see coming off the ending of ""Fallen Kingdom"", but I can't blame the movie for that. I feel like there were many more interesting stories that could've been told here, but what we got was okay. It just makes me want to see more from this world at this time, with the dinosaurs being out in the world it leaves a lot of potential stories open to be told! This story, however, was very poorly told. It was exceptionally weakly written, and was not compelling or interesting for much of the film. I normally get into films pretty easily, but it took me a good 45 minutes to get into this one. The script even felt like fan-fiction at times, and never really sold me on what was going on. The script has no emotion to it, the audience has no emotional connection to the characters (even the old ones) and I felt like I didn't really care what happened in multiple instances. The cloning problem... the locusts... Biosyn... it's just all sort of there... and the film is very much an overstuffed jumble of characters and plotlines.The most heinous crime however: the fact that this film normalizes dinosaurs being in the world. Because of this, we lose the awe and wonder of seeing dinosaurs alongside the characters, a feeling that has been present in every ""Jurassic"" film until now. Not only that, but we also lose the scare factor that makes these films so great. There's no suspense, no tension, just straight action. Every dinosaur scene doesn't feel as threatening as it should... and there's a moment in the finale that is a prime example of this. I also did not love the locusts plot... took way too much away from the dinosaurs. Like... this is a dinosaur movie right? In the (paraphrased) words of Ian Malcolm: Do you plan to have dinosaurs in your dinosaur movie? The script does not balance itself well either, the characters have no compelling drama or story and the dinosaurs don't either... it just feels hollow. Where are all the big ideas about genetic experimentation and natural consequences? I also found the film to be both too long and not long enough. There are way too many characters, and half are unnecessary, they just take up screen time. And one other thing... WHY WASN'T THE PROLOGUE IN THE FILM?! They released this great 5 minute sequence as advertising last year, saying it was the prologue to the film, and yet the movie instead starts with an abysmally executed ""last time on Jurassic World..."" kind of recap. Having the prologue in solves a whole ton of the issues I have with the film; it mirrors the end in interesting ways and sets up some conflicts, as well as shows an interesting scene that is mentioned multiple times throughout the film. Plus it's a much more entertaining way to begin the film.Okay... one more bad to go. Colin Trevorrow's direction. He genuinely did a terrible job here. It was so bland and had no style, it lost all Spielbergian charm he may have had when doing the first ""Jurassic World"". JA Bayona at least brought excellent gothic horror stylings to ""Fallen Kingdom"" which really made it feel horrific... and then we go to this bland, generic stuff. Nothing sticks out, it's just generic blockbuster filmmaking. Sure there are a few interesting visuals and a final montage that I love, but I'm sure under a different direction they would be even better.Now, you might be wondering: after all those criticisms, how did you still enjoy it? Well, despite it not being what I wanted and being a very flawed film, it was at least fun! I was entertained, there was some cool Dino stuff, some fun action set-pieces, and I loved that the production team committed to using more animatronics for the dinosaurs. It just helped make them feel more authentic! I also LOVED the return of the original cast, and was so happy to see they actually played major roles in the plot. Plus, the new cast from the current films wasn't half-bad either. I also loved how the human villain is technically from the first film, and there were some many great nods to the original ""Jurassic Park""! Speaking of the villain... Biosyn is literally an evil Apple, and Dodgson is literally an evil Tim Cook... right down to the look! I loved this sly critique of modern capitalist culture, and how many companies (especially in the tech sector) behave. There were also some really cool visual sequences, and the sound in this movie was great! I also loved Michael Giacchino's score! He did a lot of the heavy lifting for the emotion of the film, trying his best to make it resonate with music where the screenplay couldn't. And by god it worked! This score really did elevate so many moments for me, and used themes from all over!So while I do think this film is deeply flawed, I enjoyed it! I'm still not 100% sure how I feel about it, but I do know I liked it better than ""Jurassic Park 3""! I would definitely recommend seeing it, especially if you have enjoyed the rest of this franchise. I wouldn't even mind seeing more! There's still a ton of potential for future stories, and I think I would enjoy this even more knowing this is just the beginning of something new. While it is no ""Jurassic Park"", and definitely doesn't have suspense... it is a really fun action blockbuster! If you can get through the 1st act... the last 2/3 are a great time! I loved parts, but some didn't work for me, and yet I would still recommend checking it out! How could you say no to dinosaurs?",Notr
9,"If I were to list out all the things this movie focuses on, dinosaurs would be fifth or sixth, behind multiple storylines that range from bland to useless. I'm baffled by how little focus is on dinosaurs. And I don't just mean they are barely onscreen. The original Jurassic Park barely had any for the first hour. But everything leading up to that, the story, dialogue and themes, were all focused on dinosaurs.That's not the case with Dominion. The majority of the storylines are tangentially related at best, completely unrelated at worst. Imagine watching Taken but Liam Neeson has to watch out for dinosaurs... that's one storyline. You could replace dinosaurs with any scary creatures and it would make little difference to the plot.On top of that, they did a poor job of balancing so many storylines with different characters. Or maybe it's because every single one is uninteresting. And the moment when the different characters come together falls completely flat. I compare it to Stranger Things, when the stories converge and the crew is finally together, those moments are so impactful and exciting. They feel earned and elevate everything after. In Dominion, you don't feel any kind of magic.Some parts were so bad they made me cringe or roll my eyes. But that wasn't the case for the majority of the movie. So why such a harsh score? Because this movie, which is the definition of a popcorn flick here to entertain us, is unbelievably boring. I had 8 hours of sleep last night and drank a Red Bull, yet I was struggling to stay awake. I had to un-recline.All of the action scenes are forgettable. Literally. It's only been a few hours and I can remember maybe a couple cool moments. And one thing I couldn't believe, the climax action sequence is straight-up copied from one of the previous movies. I won't say which one, but I'm baffled they went this route. It's even sadder when you realize it's worse than what it copied in every way.As for the dinosaur effects, at times the animatronic dinosaurs look like toys. And the CGI dinosaurs look a bit off. I don't think it's poor CGI but something about it doesn't feel right.I am so disappointed this is what they gave us for their self-proclaimed ""epic conclusion of the Jurassic era."" Especially after Fallen Kingdom left us with such an exciting cliffhanger, the chaos that awaits the people of the world when dinosaurs are unleashed upon them. That's not at all what we get.I loved the first Jurassic World. And while the second is highly flawed, it's still entertaining and filled with tension and suspense. I felt none of that with Dominion.

10,"Jurassic World Dominion is the third and final film in the Jurassic Park/World franchise. And what we get is great visuals, fun action, good performances, and nostalgia from the series. But at the cost of a good story.The good in this movie is of course the visuals. They are outstanding. The dinosaurs look great, and it's a true spectacle. The action too is really good. It may not be the best in the series, but it's fun and exciting. The performances are also pretty good. Isabella Sermon is a lot better here than in the last film. She is actually pretty funny here. The new characters brought in are for the most part pretty good. But the returning cast is great. Jeff Goldblum is very funny here. The overall nostalgia in the movie is quite nice. And finally the pace of the movie moves nicely to be entertaining.But the story here is not very good. This movie isn't bad, but the story could've made it worse. The premise doesn't live up to the promise that the last film set up. The villains here are pretty bad. They're not threatening at all, and pretty forgettable. The movie also has a messy narrative as it jumps from one place to another. Overall this is the most disappointing film in the series.Overall Jurassic World: Dominion suffers from a weak story, forgettable villains, and a messy narrative, but it's saved thanks to great visuals, fun action, good performances, and nice nostalgia from the series. This may be the most disappointing film in the series, but it's far from the worst.",Notr
11,I personally enjoyed the film. Will everyone like it? No.I liked catching up with the old characters and I liked the dinosaur designs. The story was a continuation as expected.I had fun.,Notr
12,"Before I went to this film (because my Grandson is nuts about this series of films) I read one newspaper review. It wasn't glowing, but it was positive. Unfortunately, this is a mess. Others have already talked about the issues I have. Granted, this is an empty headed summer movie, it could still have been done with some serious thought. I was hanging in there throughout with a new dinosaur attack every three minutes, and velociraptors going at fifty miles per hour and not getting tired. Humans being assaulted time after time and yet showing no fatigue. I also didn't see a scratch on any of them. But the best of all was the promise made to a baby dinosaur and his mother that precluded saving the world from famine. Not to mentioned the coincidences of everyone showing up in just the right places. I still don't understand how they got into that facility so easily. The return of the original cast was not helpful other than Jeff Goldblum's sarcasm. Anyway, it's all been said. This is a poor movie.",Notr
13,"Yeah, it's another one of the *World editions of Jurassic Park.It's really cheesy, like all the *World movies, but it's still entertaining. This one has a really weak story, which you figure out almost within minutes of the movie. The dinos are so very much in the background here compared to the other movies.",Notr
14,"I don't know whether this is a fabled memory, but a few years ago I think I read an interview where director Colin Trevorrow said that the story of Dominion was always his ultimate go-to, that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were the stepping stones to there (almost as if it was gathering the right build-up with characters, fan anticipation, budget, and technological advances). For every reason imaginable, I believed him. Where Fallen Kingdom ended, you had endless opportunity to explore the world with dinosaurs running amok and causing mayhem. Final shots of Fallen Kingdom included the T-Rex at a zoo, the Mosasaurus attacking surfers, a velociraptor overlooking a suburban California, and pterodactyls towering above a tourist-populated Las Vegas. It was all there; think The Lost World's San Diego epilogue but on a grander scale with more dinosaurs. Throw in the military, philosophical conversations regarding their eradication versus their survival, advance some more characters, and you have a bona fide fun summer blockbuster.This didn't happen.No matter what my actual opinion is of the film hereon out, I can't help but be letdown with disappointment that Trevorrow either deluded himself into believing this was the kind of conclusion that fans yearned for ala War for the Planet of the Apes (which has a much more compelling protagonist that makes it work despite its story misdirection) or J. A. Bayona pulled a Rian Johnson and put him in a corner with the concluding chapter that he had to rectify and had no actual written plan of his own. And it's not that there isn't a medium where this story doesn't work just fine. I can imagine the main plot elements being adapted from, say, a novelization or a comic series. Hell, there was even that Battle at Big Rock short that was done which could have told these elements on their own, or at the very least introduced them. Instead, they threw in extremely disjointed story bits for this final chapter that seemed to have no source of origin. They felt like they were the contrivance meant to unite our two character groups, and nothing more.Dominion starts off very okay. It shows that it can slow down, have a genuine heartbeat, provide pathos for the existence of our reptilian brethren, trot the globe to see how they have integrated (or not) with our species, and reintroduce characters new and old (with possible internal conflicts) to show how they would pave their globetrotting paths. They even fix some of the poorly written aspects of Fallen Kingdom such as maturing Franklin's character, giving better use to the laser-targeting attack system, and giving Maisie a more believable backstory. All of this is supported with fantastic animatronic work and much improved CGI blending with it. I thought the visuals were mostly a knockout and supported the onscreen setups.Not only that, but Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum kindled a similar flame to their interactions in JP1 and you sat forward to watch those moments. I caught myself smiling quite a few times during those exchanges. Jeff Goldblum was especially used well as he was able to inject entertainment and comedy through his dialogue where the film otherwise was flat with on its attempts. They were not small cameo appearances and served crucial roles to the film. You buy where they are in their lives, and even though TLW and JP3 are retconned the actors clearly tapped into those experiences for their performances to accentuate their statuses.Speaking of buy-in, I would have given this film a long leash on a lot of things they could have done or did with this movie. We hit the point where we can embrace the ridiculous in several places. Want to make Blue become Owen's pet and attack guard? Go right on ahead. Want to modernize the action and give our protagonists more ability and skill that you might see in the Fast & Furious franchise or with our human Marvel heroes? If the dinosaurs get their large share of the action as well, I'm on board (the Malta scene is a perfect example of this). Want to pay homage to the previous films as you conclude your franchise? That is what I expect. I also expect them to diversify this on a tonal level where need be as to not become too stale, and I think I was feeling that here. Hell, there is nearly a half-hour duration where not a single dinosaur is shown or brought up, and if it's in anticipation for what is to come while building character or story then I will let it play out.The problem really arose both when the movie decided to abandon the broad, peregrinating experience and confine its setting. Dominion is the saga's epic conclusion and did not need to put on this hat. This was a major rug pull from what was anticipated, and soured itself spending an excruciatingly long time on something that left little entertainment, tension, or dinosaurs. When they do show up, the moments become a little one-note. Our good guys have plot armor such as raptors that can run at vehicle speeds but can't catch up to running characters, or when they are cornered they just get roared at or ran/flown/swam past until they find their way out of the situation, or when they know they can stand around and trust that a carnivore won't eat them because reasons. Bryce Dallas Howard got the best/most suspenseful dino encounters at this stage of the film and they actually work extremely well, but for a near 150-minute movie these are few and far between, and for this franchise you really have to sit and ask yourself if there is a chance that she won't survive any of these instances.A lot of this could have been made better if our Rexy got some great moments, but even she was backdropped and upstaged too often to matter, or when she does come on screen it seems to be a rehashed occurrence from something of old. She looked and sounded good, though. I want to restate how good the dinosaurs actually looked here, and I want to commend the visual effects departments for what they were able to do in that department. If there was a niggle I'd have here, it would probably be in the weight of the raptor movement which felt too light and jittery. That probably only makes sense in my head, but the rest looked really good. If knowing that I would have to wait 21 years after 2001's Jurassic Park III to finally get the sequel with visuals that really soar, I would gladly take it. I just wish it was with a better film, or at least with a film that I would want to rewatch over and again. Instead, this left an aftertaste that makes me want to instead go and watch Top Gun: Maverick for a fourth time. Outside of demo material, I don't even know if I will be a completionist and get this on UHD a few months down the line. Normally one shouldn't fault a film for letting their own speculation become expectation, but in this particular instance I very much believe that you can. All signs and promotions hinted toward a different kind of movie and story, but despite the good parts it did have, this was too much of a misguided, ineffectual whimper.",Notr
15,"While this movie isn't perfect, it doesn't deserve the hate it receives online. There are some laughable and cringe-y scenes, but overall the movie has some great shots, and was very fun and enjoyable.",Notr
16,"This movie attempts to exploit the nostalgia of the original characters and it fails miserably at every level. The action, the editing, the direction, it's all terrible. The movie has no focus, too many characters that have nothing to do and nothing to do with each other. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is they did use plenty of ""real"" props for some of the dinosaurs, so it's not like the actors are always looking at a green screen. However, everyone just feels kind of disconnected from the movie. Like everyone involved knew the script was trash and the movie would just be a cash grab because they knew idiots like myself would go and see it. Oh well. Just Hollywood doing what they do best.",Notr

There are as many dinosaurs in this as there were in ANY of the JP/JW films. It's an absolutely blast! It's a really fun, exciting summer movie!!

18,"I'm going to make this short...Jurassic World: Dominion is like cleaning out your refrigerator and dumping a bunch of stuff in the trash. Only in this case, they decided to dump the ""stuff"" on the screen in this film. Jurassic World: Dominion has a lot of story arcs with no real connection or depth. People are popping in, popping back out, then popping in again, boring us with trite laughable dialogue and no real character development; you don't really care about any of these people. Just when you think there might be something to a scene with the familar charcaters, CUT TO another scene with no set-up. This film is like watching a 3:00 AM B-movie that is so bad, it does its job by putting you back to sleep. And let's talk about the dinosaurs, velociraptors and various man-eating prehistoric creatures...nah, it's not worth it because other than the penultimate scene where the biggest and baddest were going at each other, they were simply an after-thought. Go figure.Everyone connected to this film tried to do too much and it didn't work as far as the storytelling is concerned. As I said before, they emptied the refrigerator and threw in everything in this film and it left a bad taste in my mouth because there was just too much ""stuff.""",Notr
19,"Mixed bag of greatness and mediocre. A really enjoyable blockbuster for what it is, has some poor dialogue in some scenes and a little cheesy bits with the boss of Bryson. The cast though is excellent, cinematography is amaze balls, and there's plenty of awesome high budgeted action sequences throughout.I loved a lot of it though I must say it's great fun especially in IMAX! There was even a great Q&A I got to see was silly when someone said finally when that ended I was thinking why pay for the longer version with extras if you don't want to see that aspect some don't make sense. I crave any special feature I'd work on film if I could and I'd say Jurassic World: Dominion is a worth seeing.",Notr
20,"I absolutely hated this film... legacy characters used as bait for box office numbers, a horrible plot that makes the incredibly long runtime absolutely insufferable. The actors aren't at fault, the visuals are good (as you might expect from a movie this expensive), but the script is atrocious, and ""the epic conclusion"" is not very much a conclusion, the main issue is not solved, and everything that was wrong in the previous films is just elevated in this film, absolutely terrible film, don't watch it.",Notr

22,"6th film in the Jurassic series that brings back the main 3 actors of the original Jurassic Park movies to share the screen with the main actors of the Jurassic World Movies to give a grand sent off to the entire series. Unfortunately, both sets of actors are split up in two completely different stories that combine towards the climax and one of the stories ( The one with Neil, Dern and Goldblum) is ten times more interesting than the other one ( The one with Pratt and Howard). In fact, with a heavy rewrite and a better director at the helm, the story involving the original Jurassic Park characters would have a been a very good Jurassic Sequel on its own right. Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world, so we are stuck with a another bad Jurassic World sequel that does not know on what it wants to be .The story involving the original Jurassic Park cast is actual a very interesting one that involves corporate espionage and genetic engineering. A story on which if it had a stronger screenplay, a better director and a direct focus on what this series is really about , it would have been a great continuation of Michael Crichton's work and a great bookend to Steven Spielberg's first two Jurassic Park films (The original and it's only true and worthy sequel ""The Lost World""). Unfortunately under Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly dimwitted screenplay, the story only scratches the surface of the subject matter and is shoehorned to run parallel with the other story in this movie, which is not very thought out and is really pretty bad . Fortunately for the audience, the characters of Alan Grant , Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm are as endearing as ever and the actors are having a fun. Jeff Goldblum can read a phone book and make it interesting, intelligent, funny and entertaining. His character's sarcastic wit is so on point in certain scenes that you end up thinking that Jeff is trying to break the 4th wall to let the audience know on how he really feels about this movie. Sam Neill is great as well, making a welcome return to his character and he actually looks happy to be in this film ( A far cry from the tired performance he gave in the horrible ""Jurassic Park 3"" but who can blame him) and Lara Dern is as intelligent, spunky and sassy as ever. The charisma and chemistry of all three of the returning Jurassic Park actors more than make up for the half baked plot line they are working with.The same can't be said for the returning Jurassic World actors, whose plot line is a direct sequel to the events of the horrible ""Fallen Kingdom"" and it does not help that both Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard look disinterested in their roles. Pratt, who was a welcome addition in ""Jurassic World"" just looks tired and bored here and Howard, (who in my opinion had a harder character to play and that reason being is the fact that her character changes personalities from one film to the next ) looks ready to move on from this franchise. Their story involving the kidnapping of the clone child of ""Fallen Kingdom"" and Blue's own baby raptor is so bad that it's an anchor over the neck of this movie. Their story ends up as a bad rip off of the Jason Bourne series. You have shady bad guys, bad stereotypes, a unbelievable plane crash and a fight with dinosaurs in a city (Anybody who still crying over the T-Rex in San Diego in ""The Lost World"" should keep their mouths shut after they see this terrible sequence in this film). Not to mention the characters striking super hero poses in certain scenes, which makes this story impossible to take seriously. Fortunately or unfortunately if you think about it, the two parallel stories connect towards the climax and our heroes meet for the first time. Which is also eye opening because you can see how shallow the characters from ""Jurassic World"" are compared to the characters of ""Jurassic Park"". Not to mention the fact that the ""Park"" actors are making an effort to bring something to this mess while the ""World"" actors are just going through the motions.Which is a shame because Neil, Dern and Goldblum remind the audience on why the original Jurassic Park is such a class act and that was because it had great characters and great actors behind them. Unfortunately, not even their Herculean efforts can stop this film for being crushed by the weight of its own stupidity.",Notr
23,"4 yrs have passed since the events of Fallen Kingdom. Dinosaurs now roam the modern world and people have somewhat adjusted to that fact. For the most part, the apex predators have been rounded up and kept contained by special organizations. However, there has been quite the demand in the black market for dinosaurs of all kinds. Illegal breeding sites are everywhere.One of the organizations that prioritized rounding up the apex predator dinosaurs is Biosyn, a global leader in most every industry, from biological science, to engineering, to improving food crops. Biosyn has set up a sanctuary research facility (in the middle nowhere) where they house most every species of dinosaur on earth. There they study dinosaur dna in hopes of finding uses for all kinds of human diseases and deficiencies.Throughout the heartland of the U. S., an anomaly has begun to occur. Something has begun destroying crops everywhere,, with the exception of very specific crops (or shall I say,, specific crop producers). It has the scientific world baffled, and worried that if this continues the entire world's food supply
will disappear within a generation.One scientist in particular concerned with this anomaly is Ellie Settler, who is en route to visit the Biosyn research center and get some answers on what they are doing to combat these problems. Her only problem is needing someone that she trusts to back her up. So who can she call on but her old flame and partner in the game of science Alan Grant!Owen and Claire have retreated to Owen's cabin in hopes of keeping Maisie hidden from the world, knowing that certain people would do anything to get to her, study her, etc. Now 14 yrs old, Maisie is very much at odds with how she came to be in the world, and wonders who her mother (Christine Lockwood) really was. She's also very tired of being kept hidden from the world, and has a habit of wondering away from their homestead.Also,, Blue has set up a nest not too far from the cabin,, and has given birth,,,I don't want to say much more,, I will say
that I think the negative reviews are not completely deserved. Is the movie a groundbreaking, perfect example of a film? Well, no. Neither were the last two! Imo, it's fun, and I didn't see the direction they went in coming (at least not most of it). It's a straight 7 rating imo. I will also say that this needs to be the last (but we know how that goes).",Notr
24,"Easily my least favorite movie in the Jurassic Park saga. Absolutely horrible on ever level and a fundamental misunderstanding at what makes this saga so interesting. Trevorrow had no clue what he was doing with this movie. He was told to make the final film in a six movie saga and said to himself ""Hmm let's not focus on the dinosaurs in this FINAL FILM"". How do you not understand what people want to see these movies for. You need to actually focus on the dinosaurs or you are not gonna keep peoples attention and I feel that is what happened here. Instead the film focuses on giant locusts? Why is this so interesting that you need to sideline the dinosaurs for it. I didn't want to see an espionage story about kidnapping, locusts, and clones. I just want to see what the world would be like if dinosaurs took over which we don't see either. The main issue that happened in the previous film that CHANGED THE STATUS QUO is barely focused on besides a few scenes. It's baffling why they would do this. Not even the original cast can save this. Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill seem like they are having fun but the dialogue they are given is horrendous. The dialogue in general is bad but they got it the worst. The whole cast generally doesn't seem to be trying besides Neill and Goldblum. Everyone felt very low energy and if they didn't want to be there. The villain gave the worst performance in the film. They just let that guy spitball all these awkward lines and just didn't know when to say cut. The film feels relatively low stakes as well. It doesn't feel like a finale at all but more like a bad epilogue. Fallen Kingdom feels more like a finale than this and that movie is BAD. There isn't any build up to the final dinosaur battle as well. Apparently it was set up in the prologue that they released a year ago but they decided to cut it from the movie. They decide to cut the scene that shows the conflict between different species of dinosaur. Yeah great job guys. It doesn't help that this film is mindlessly boring as well and it doesn't deserve its 2 and a half hour runtime. This is a train wreck of a film that you shouldn't watch even if you like the original film. It's a waste of your money.",Notr
25,"Lets face it, it could be better. Not the best Jurassic movie, but yet I liked it. I'm a big fan of Jurassic park and I was really happy when they announced the Jurassic world. My childhood came to life.For this movie, I knew it wasn't going to surprise me, but I wanted the end, I wanted to say goodbye to my beloved dinos. And even it wasn't the best, I was pretty satisfied. I think we got a lot of closures. Maisie's origin, much more dinos than ever, old actors back together and their own ""moment"" :D and I was really glad for Henry, he always wanted to do something incredible and most of time it didn't work, but this time he gets his redemption. Overall it's not the best but it did make my heart flutter one last time. Still loves the franchise and I hope for those who loved the original trilogy will find the same satisfactory like I did...Life always finds a way.... this time we were given coexisting world, when dinos live with us. I don't know about you guys but I was more than okay with the ending like this. :)",Notr

The tension and thrills as well as a solid conclusion to all the characters, new and the old ones that didnt get a decent ending in the original trilogy made it enjoyable enough. The dialogue was poor at times there is no denying it but overall solid action and conclusive.",Notr
27,"I loved the first Jurassic Park (1993) film and still think it's an amazingly enjoyable movie. Unfortunately, every entry after is never as good or even downright bad. Jurassic World Dominion is the final entry in the Jurassic World trilogy and the one that unites the cast of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World together. To see the return of the main trio from Jurassic Park was the biggest reason I was looking forward to this film. Does Jurassic World Dominion stick the landing or is it just a big pile of s#*%?One thing that the Jurassic World franchise has done better and better is the visuals. Jurassic World Dominion has no doubt the best visuals and cinematography of all the films so far. There are some pretty great shots of dinosaurs without a doubt. There are also some pretty fun action sequences. For example, in Malta where dinosaurs are chasing Chris Pratt and Bryce throughout the city. The part in Malta also explores the black market of Dinosaurs and that was pretty interesting. One pretty annoying issue with the Jurassic World franchise is the lack of animatronics but Dominion uses a lot of animatronics. I appreciated it as it made the Dinosaurs feel a bit more real when they were being interacted with.My biggest reason for watching was the OG cast and it was great seeing all of them together again. Laura Dern and Sam Neill are great together as Ellie Satler and Alan Grant respectively. Both of them don't phone it in and it feels like the same characters we last saw 21 years ago. My favourite is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm and he just steals every scene he is in. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard also return and they are fine. The movie introduces some new characters and one of them is Kayla played by DeWanda Wise. DeWanda is great and a real standout in the film thanks to her charismatic performance. Kayla ends up being a fun character to watch thanks to her coolness and natural reaction to all the craziness happening.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is very difficult to like. My biggest annoyance is the plot. There are two plot lines, one with Chris Pratt involving a kidnapping of Maisie (the clone daughter from the previous film) and another with the OG cast which just features them snooping around a big corporation. One of the plotlines is more exciting and interesting while also resulting in thrilling dinosaur action. The OG cast plotline is just so boring, goofy and just dumb. It's a shame that the OG cast was done dirty like that. The movie feels like two different movies shoved into one leading to two different stories with different tones. The main story also features this plot device concerning locusts and it's just really stupid.The movie also features a sort of new human villain in Dodgson played by Campbell Scott. I say sort of new because he is technically playing the same character that was briefly in the first Jurassic Park film albeit it's a different actor now. He is just a very underwhelming villain. He is just not that interesting or threatening. They also have a new dinosaur villain in the Giganotosaurus and it also sucks. It barely has any screen time and is not even as scary as any of the previous dinosaur villains. There is also another new character introduced called Ramsay played by Mamoudou Athie who I think does a good job in the role. What makes his character is his supposed relationship with Dodgson which is mentioned a couple of times. However, it is barely explored yet for some reason is put into the film like it is an emotional or important element and it was just baffling.Maisie returns from the previous film and has become incredibly unlikeable. I'm not a big fan of bratty kid characters, especially ones that cause the deaths of dozens of innocent people. Her character is written poorly and I do think the actress gives a pretty weak performance which doesn't help. The movie is also way too long with its runtime being 146 minutes. A majority of the runtime is just boring human stuff with maybe 15-20 minutes of some dinosaur stuff. The original Jurassic Park cast and the new Jurassic World cast don't even meet until the final act. Once they meet, it feels very anti-climatic and unnatural, it just sort of happens. I'm gutted that the movie wastes an interesting idea in exploring the consequences of dinosaurs being released into the world and how the world deals with it. Instead, this idea is just brushed over within the first 5 minutes. The film doesn't do anything original and just does dinosaurs on an island again! The movie doesn't even spend time dealing with the message that the film starts with which is can humans and dinosaurs coexist? The film just ends with this magically being answered and resolved with no explanation how?Overall, what a massive disappointment. While I didn't particularly enjoy Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), the movie ends on a fascinating note that could've made for an amazing 3rd film. Regrettably, Jurassic World Dominion ends up being more interested in being a cheap, cheesy, B movie action thrill and even then it doesn't do that great either. I'm devastated that the so-called Avengers of the Jurassic franchise is just a very mediocre and underwhelming dinosaur movie. I ended up feeling like it was time for this franchise to go extinct. As Ian once said, ""that's one big pile of s#*%"".",Notr
28,"Jurassic World: Dominion is not the disaster many claim it is-it's overhated. At the same time, it's hard not to feel a little let down, because there are so many missed opportunities that could have made the story far stronger.The biggest disappointment is how the film sidelines its most interesting setup. Dinosaurs now live among humans, and that premise alone could've carried an entire movie. Instead, we get a clunky subplot about locusts that feels like it wandered in from a different sci-fi script. The dinosaurs are still great, but too often they feel like background noise when they should've been the centerpiece.That said, it's not all bad. Seeing the legacy cast (Grant, Sattler, and Malcolm) back together again is fantastic, and their chemistry shines. There are thrilling action set pieces, some genuinely fun dinosaur encounters, and a handful of moments that remind you why you love this franchise in the first place.Ultimately, Dominion is a mixed bag-ambitious but unfocused, entertaining but frustrating. It's not the worst entry by any means, but it wastes a golden chance to take the series in a bold new direction. A 6/10 because despite its flaws, it's still a fun ride-it just could've been so much more.",Notr
29,"Colin Trevorrow has managed to make himself the Ryan Johnson of the Jurassic Park franchise with this film and the vanity with which he promoted and defended it. Jurassic World: Dominion is a soulless film, without a shred of understanding of the magic of the original. This made-for-its-own-good movie has no originality on its own terms, no respect for the fans of this once-grand dinosaur movie series, and not an ounce of artistic merit to the film genre. On top of that, this film is also dumb from start to finish and full of holes in the story. It's a good thing Trevorrow is also responsible for the screenplay and apparently spent years looking forward to this finale, because according to his own statements, he knew from the start to which end he wanted to lead the Jurassic World trilogy.The film begins by leaving out its own story plots from the last two films. For example, how the dinosaurs were able to spread across the planet is left out, or it is assumed that you accept that this is explained via the illegal and legalized trade in the animals. The dinosaur scenes at the beginning are quite nice, but ultimately just a two-minute montage of big dinosaur scenes. The animal rescue comes across as a naive idea in the context of the film and additionally as a silly attempt at a cross-reference to the actually problematic treatment of animals in our society. The character development of Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is just thrown at you, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is so on the mark in his already shallow and cliché-laden development that as a viewer you can definitely handle the fact that he is now foolishly riding horses, severing individual dinosaurs from their herd for ""rescue"". Secondary characters are introduced, only to be used as vehicles for the unfolding silly story without any depth of their own. The story surrounding the characters in the Jurassic World series quickly devolves into a globe-trotting, bad James Bond knock-off with a focus on the use of firearms, car chases and silly, superficial short cons. It goes to some Arabian countries, to a stupidly hidden black market for dinosaur goods, to a reservation of the company of ""Dogson!"". We've got Dodgson here"" - Dodgson (Campbell Scott), who for reasons not told somehow managed to become one of the biggest tech moguls in the world. Just as somehow, by the way, he has also managed to recover the nostalgic cream can of Dennis Nedry's dinosaur DNA theft and keep it on his shelf. Their story then just jumps from action scene to action scene, where the ""heroes"" of the story, staged in a very modern way, survive every adversity. Apart from gunshots and dinosaur attacks, they survive a plane crash, numerous accidents and explosions unharmed. This plot, which undercuts any suspense, also leads to no fear or adrenaline buildup at all around the characters, which should actually serve to help viewers identify with them. Trevorrow makes himself the king of despondency here and destroys the legacy of the original film and its two original and respectful sequels.By the way, the motivation for the cloned girl Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) is simply thrown overboard. Yes, that's how this trilogy was planned by the would-be visionary Trevorrow. Instead of the comprehensible cloning of the lost daughter, it is now the daughter herself who clones herself. The motivation, of course, is to save the world from disease and natural disasters. Oh, no, the motivation was the desire to save one's own new self from a deadly disease from which one suffers. Or was it? Didn't Trevorrow write a scene in which it's made clear that Lockwood didn't know about her disease when she cloned herself? Well, at least Trevorrow is so self-convinced that he doesn't care about consistency in the plot even in the context of just one film. The director and filmmaker never seems to have read an ethics book either, because the cloning action is consensually presented as a moral heroic act. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) would have to perceive this as a slap in the face, but what do the philosophical underpinnings of the original matter if a film is just poured on with cool sayings and action scenes without paying attention to the plot or the development of individual highlights in the film.The plot around the characters of the original resembles chicanery for the fans of the franchise. The dream team of Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), which worked so well, is suddenly a group consisting only of references to the grandiose start of the series, which becomes more insufferable, shallow and uninteresting by the minute. Their plot around the locust plague, which at least at the beginning seems like an interesting idea before it too is told into the barrel, is at least a tad better than the action movie scenes around Pratt and Howard. But again, it's overflowing with plot holes, dumb lines, and a dynamic between Grant and Sattler so unpleasant it could make you sick. Laura Dern, by the way, plays her role so badly that she makes Ellie Sattler the most unpleasant character in the film, but since her Star Wars appearance, she's been practiced at helping destroy classic franchises.BD Wong's character development, by the way, is among the dumbest in film history. From an over-motivated and morally disinterested character in Jurassic Park, to the self-convinced and morally still subterranean leader in Jurassic World, to the morally now completely disintegrated dinosaur trader from Fallen Kingdom, we now witness here a Henry Wu who at the beginning of the film is still responsible for a biblical-capitalist plague of locusts, but at the end of the film is sneaking through a cornfield like a reformed science hippie, enjoying the redemptive feeling of moral poise. Incredibly stupid.Unbelievably stupid is much else in this film as well. The overpopulation of different dinosaurs that you get to see for a few seconds attests to a lack of understanding of the magic of the original and a lack of appreciation for the genius of how the dino scenes were handled there. The sprinkling of modern wokeness is still within limits, but where it does appear it is, as you might expect, just plain silly. The waste of potential from the old films is obvious here. The Dilophosaurs are wasted, the Carnosaurs are so scary that a couple of betting-addicted dino-fight viewers just keep watching a dino-human fight while a few feet behind them the Carnosaurs wreak havoc. The Dimetrodon, which by the way are not dinosaurs, are barely shown, just as no dinosaur can be viewed even once with enough time and calm, instead they become animal horror creatures with nothing on them but brutal aggressiveness. In the end, there is yet another stupid dinosaur fight that seems like an even dumber copy of the stupid finale of the otherwise watchable first part of the Jurassic World trilogy. The T-Rex pretending to be dead is perhaps the dumbest dino scene in the entire franchise. Let's not forget that Dearing and Grady's love for their adopted daughter is so strong that they simply make the girl stand very, very close to a velociraptor at the end of the film, because Grady is, after all, friends with this primeval predator. In order to shoot such nonsense, one must have a completely narcissistic alienation from reality....
One could go on for a long time listing the numerous plotholes, stupidities and the impudent lack of understanding of what made the original so fantastic, but that would probably take readers of this review just as long as this bloated action nonsense has running time. But one thing needs to be mentioned: The recap of the plot and the outcome for the planet presented at the end of the film is over-politicized, naive, unscientific garbage that you can either laugh your head off at in cynical fashion or cry yourself to sleep in lonely despair over humanity. Dinosaurs coexisting in harmony with the rest of nature, triceratops performing their savannah march with elephants, geese flying fearlessly with pterodactyls, blue whales swimming in peace alongside a mosasaur, and herds of wild horses, mingling with other racing dinosaur herds are certainly realistic and the ultimate goal that a human race should have in the context of a specially created species extinction by genetically manipulating the evolutionary rhythm of Earth's history.As a conclusion, it remains to mention once again that Trevorrow could impressively prove his complete lack of cinematic understanding with this film and that Star Wars: The Last Jedi now has to share the Olympus of destroyed franchises with Jurassic World: Dominion. Nothing short of a disgrace to cinema history. Tragic.",Notr
30,"This latest Jurassic installment doesn't bring much did the table that we haven't already seen before. While it was nice seeing the original characters reunite, the film lacked any sort of charisma compared to the previous films. Not even O'Neill, Dern or Goldblum could elevate the material. Lastly, the dinosaur ""battles"" felt pedantic and uninspired. Overall, no great Spielbergian ""Whoa!"" moments. 6/10.",Notr
31,"Jurassic World Dominion feels like it became a self-parody during the first act of the movie. Sure it's nice that they're referencing the past movies in kind, but the lapses in logic, the annoying deus-ex machinas at play, the apparent brainlessness of some of the characters and the dinosaurs becoming part of Earth's everyday socioeconomic hemisphere: it was a wasted opportunity and felt like a misleading tease from Fallen Kingdom.There was potential here: uniting two generations of Jurassic Park casts, uniting the dinosaurs in their fight for survival, and maybe even showing the fallout of such a situation where dinosaurs now actually co-exist alongside people.The Jurassic franchise has definitely exhausted all possibilities at this point in time: but I think we KNOW Universal's are least considering another sequel to this 'conclusion'.What next? Jurassic Stars? Where they take the dinosaurs literally to outer-space or something? At least that'd provide some more ironic entertainment and become a midnight movie phenomenon.",Notr

The old and new cast blending works fairly well Though can be somewhat forced at times with the comic relief.

Apparently the writers, producers and director think you can just stick any animal in any environment and it will thrive.They also think evolution works in months and a couple years and not tens and even hundreds of millions of years.I understand this is Sci first, but they're trying to make it believable, you CAN NOT have it both ways, pick a lane!Then you have the incredibly boring and dragged out plot. They literally might aswell just flipped us the finger at this point.Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life and the original cast should be ashamed of themselves for selling out dignity for a quick pay check.The reviews on this piece of trash are definitely accurate, I mean, how did they direct, edit and produce this, see the end result and be like ""yup, this is how a trilogy is supposed to end""?

40,"""Jurassic World: Dominion"" is an Action - SciFi and the third movie of the ""Jurassic World"" trilogy, in which we watch Maisie Lockwood being tracked down by Biosyn, four years after the destruction of Isla Nublar.I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie and I was a bit let down by it. The plot was predictable as in the two previous movies so, there was not any surprise on that. Despite the addition of some old characters of the franchise and revisiting some old scenes of the franchise there was not a real plot or story. The direction that was made by Colin Trevorrow, the same director ""Jurassic World"" of 2015, was also predictable and a bit boring at some moments, it was lacking that spark that the original Jurassic Park had. The interpretations of Sam Neill who played as Alan Grant, Laura Dern who played as Ellie Sattler and Jeff Goldblum who played as Ian Malcolm were good since there were plenty of nostalgic moments but not good enough to save this movie. To sum up, I have to say that ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" is an above average action movie that had the potential to be a perfect movie and unfortunately it failed.",Notr

Worst of all, in addition to being sloppily put together, is it's beyond derivitive. I honestly feel like I've seen the majority of these story tropes used in a vast catalog of other, much better films. Also, it has one of the worst villians I've seen put to screen. His acting and the dialogue for his character was about the equivilant of a 3 year old throwing a tantrum. Beyond annoying and even more unrealistic. The special FX weren't even anything awesome, just more of the same. However, I do have to give it up to the team that did the creature designs for the practical FX, those were more impressive. I would recommend waiting for streaming, it wasn't even worth seeing on the IMAX as the majority of scenes were not worthy of the scale. 1/2 a dino out of 5.",Notr

45,"This is the first real Jurassic Park (World) movie in ages. Far superior to Jurassic Park 3 in every way, and completely better than anything the Jurassic World franchise has produced yet. Not only does it bring back the original crew, but this movie is clever, fun, scary and exciting. If I had to choose one thing to dislike about this movie, it would only be that it's a hyper simplistic plot. But that's not the point of the film. The purpose of this movie is to wrap up the Jurassic World and Park franchise, and it does it perfectly. Yes, the story itself isn't anything too impressive, but it's about as simplistic and complex as the original Jurassic Park, which is what you want in a dinosaur movie. It's not about some evil hybrid serial killer dinosaur, or some weird special agent hybrid dinosaur; it's a bit like a heist film with plenty of dinosaurs all throughout. The CGI is amazing, the acting is great, and the variety of creature is immense. But the best two things about this movie are the themes and stunning cinematography. The action scenes are jam packed with motion and power, without being overwhelming, and the dinosaurs are stunning and beautiful. Most scenes incorporating them are immaculate, visual, artistic, and inspiring. Best of all this movie has humor and horror. The funny bits are not the stupid slap stick childish jokes of the last three movies. These little humourous cues are organic and fun, mostly made by Ian Malcolm, which fits his character. No more mind numbing half winded jokes that are just randomly placed in the movie for a cheap laugh. That being said, the horror aspect of the movie was intense. Plenty of scary scenes to keep you on your toes; big vicious frightening dinosaurs, and gruesome death scenes akin to the first and second Park (Not World) movies. Just enough violence, just enough horror, and just enough joy. There are also plenty of call backs to the earlier films, and some retconning which helps bring certain character development points together.

48,"If you watched this movie, then that probably means that you saw the two prequels, and most likely the original Jurassic Park trilogy. If this is the case, and you still hated this movie, then I have only one question: were your expectations on the appropriate level for this movie?There is plenty to hate and there is plenty to love too. Out of respect for the director, I gave this movie a 7, because as I saw, he clearly did his best, and attempted to improve on the previous movies. Of course, this didn't always work out...First, let's see what I thought was missing from the movie, or what I wish was missing. I think by far the biggest mistake the movie makes is that despite all the attempts to refresh the classic JP/JW formula, the movie sticks to most of the same beats from those movies, which really gives it a tired, samey feel. Even though there are some changes, it really is just more of the same most of the time, which could not be portrayed any better, than the obligatory last, big fight at the end. Yes, the fight is spiced up with some new stuff, but overall, it is just the one you've seen in the last movie... or the movie before that, or the movie before that, etc.Aside from these ""unskippable"" beats, there are a lot of jokes, that fall flat - the film must have had at least 50 jokes in it, and I remember laughing at three of those (I guess there were some chuckles too, but you are not going to the movies for chuckles).Throughout the movie some characters acted like they were pretty dumb, which took me out of the setting, and lastly, while most of the movie was technically sound, I did have a problem with the pacing here and there. Some scenes took way too long to build up to their climaxes, which weren't even that strong, and this made the movie kind of overstay its welcome.However, there were also plenty of good things, and I believe a lot of people just hate this movie for never being as good as the original JP trilogy. And while I think that's true, I can also appreciate the JW trilogy as it is - as a different trilogy, that takes place in the same world as JP. This is a more action-packed, less serious trilogy, but on its own it is fine (as far as blockbusters go).Now, that we accepted it as a different set of movies than the first three, let's see what was good about it!For one, everything you would expect was just as good, or even better than before. The visual effects, the sound design, the music (although it was too much sometimes, but I actually liked how it was not trying to nostalgia-bait me every second), these were all great. I also think they were at their most creative, when it came to the set pieces, places and action scenes. There was some real variety in here, which I really appreciate, and contrary to what most say, I didn't think they left the set pieces too quickly, because the movie did a great job at showing us (with aerial shots, for example), that they were connected.Another good thing, that you might not expect, was the characters and their interactions (aside from a new side character, who did nothing but drive and make bad jokes throughout the whole movie, which became boring, fast). The old and new crew all performed very well, and every single one of them had something to do, without it feeling forced, disconnected, or contrived. Well, aside from a certain scene, that didn't really had to happen like that, and most probably was just the way it was for nostalgia. This one scene didn't ruin it all for me though, and I liked how the characters behaved like themselves, without it becoming exhaustingly similar to the previous films, and without them being someone who barely resembles them (looking at you, Star Wars).Okay, now take a deep breath and bear with me, because what I'm about to say might shock you... I actually liked where they took the story. I know, crazy! But to me it matters a lot, that the story stepped out of the boundaries of being ""just another Jurassic Park episode"". This is one of the things I meant, when I wrote that they did their best to create something that's not just mimicing a popular franchise. And while yes, it had a lot of the same story beats, it was still different enough, that I have to give credit for it. Of course the viewer has to keep in mind, that in the end this IS a new Jurassic World movie, and that there are some boundaries that it simply can not step out of. Still, the story of the girl, made the whole movie a little more personal, than just another ""big dino goes roar"" movie. It's certainly not groundbraking, but I think it added some depth to it, which was mostly missing from the previous two films. This accompanied with the good acting, fun character interactions and great sets, action and visuals, made for a very enjoyable experience for me.In short, my takeaway is that if you go into this movie with the right expectations, you can have a good time. This is not Jurassic Park, this is Jurassic World. It's bigger, prettier, shallow, but can be just as fun. It has several shortcomings, but this movie (not the previous ones) makes up for it with some extra care and creativity, which ultimately helps it become the best of the three JW movies. It's not great, but certainly a very enjoyable, slightly better than average blockbuster popcorn movie - but only if YOU allow it to be.",Notr
49,"What a horrid movie. One of the few movies that unfortunately made it in the 1 billion dollar club. Jurassic World was fun despite its flaws, Fallen Kingdom was just kind of eh, but this is an absolute disaster. It's just sunk down a downward spiral that leads to hell. It's bad enough to the point I'm pretty convinced it was made more for money than it was for an actually good movie, and that's sad. I don't care for this movie or this franchise anymore; the creative team leaders certainly didn't so why should I? One year later and nobody talks or cares about it. But sadly people will take advantage of the money they made and make some more Jurassic Park garbage. Why did people flock to see it, WHY?!? Everybody I've talked to who watched it instantly regretted buying tickets for this and not some other movie. What a piece of garbage.",Notr

55,"Jurassic World Dominion offered a different but enjoyable twist to the usual direction taken in the franchise. The impossible notion that dinosuars are something that can be introduced to everyday life is what makes the film truly unique. Aswell as this, it removes the thrill of seeing the dinosaurs because we've become accustomed to them after multiple movies. It is difficult to keep the enthusiasm everyone held for the first film once you repeat the same formula again and again. As far as I'm concerned, they just about pulled it off. The only reason I managed to find a little enjoyment out of the movie was because I was surrounded by friends who were genuine cowards. Personally I wouldn't watch again, but I'm glad I did with the people I did.",Notr
56,"Wow, foiled again, a movie from my youth gets a long awaited follow up, it has a great cast, with some familiar faces, a big budget, so there's action galore, and some wonderful music, but a plot..... a plot that could have been written by a random stranger walking past the studio.How on Earth is it possible for such a film to feel so vacuous, so empty, this film made me feel nothing, other than boredom. £40 that could have been used on so many other things.It's not ok these days to simply try and dazzle us with some awesome visuals, there needs to be some sort of plot, but there just isn't one, in simplistic terms it asks if man can live with dinosaurs, but of course you know what's going to happen. Some of the visuals are great, epic, some scenes though....did they run out of time?Chris Pratt, didn't do it for me, the old cast tried, but it felt hollow.Like the dinosaurs themselves, this franchise should have been left in the past. 3/10.",Notr

58,"Life once found a way. Now, I hope it loses itself.Jurassic World Dominion has its positives, namely the fantastic Legacy character's wonderful return and, well, that's it. I enjoyed their presence, especially Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum - the latter who had the best lines, as always. The rest...yeah, I sincerely hope this is the last Jurassic Anything.All throughout this movie, the word ""Dumb"" just kept popping up in my head. Dumb script. Dumb dialogue. Dumb luck with all the hilariously impossible coincidences. Too many Dumb references to this series and other Steven Spielberg classics. And the two Dumbest characters in the franchise are back: Clone Girl Maisie who hates all mankind for her decision in the last entry and that screaming boy, Franklin, though, THANK GOD, he doesn't scream in this one like all the scenes he ruined in the last one.With a huge missed opportunity to expand on the actual title of Jurassic World, this hopefully last chapter just has society dealing with dinos killing people and the economy while debating if they should be extinguished. But, never mind that, this series has always been around greed and the ineptest baddie of the franchise with the most hilariously bad security detail is up to no good and only our 1,500 heroes in this movie can stop him!While the second half is monstrously better than the first half, I still couldn't wait for this movie to be over. Sure, it's better than the two worst sequels: III and Fallen Kingdom, but not by much. Like the Terminator, this franchise should've stopped at #2 in The Lost World.The movie's absolutely boring, even with multiple action scenes and there are literally no stakes. In fact, I was always hoping throughout the first two acts, they'd have the balls to kill off any of the characters. As much as I would love to see the Legacy characters make it - forgetting about the new Jurassic World characters, never liked them much - at least the movie would've taken chances.I'm done with this series. Like Transformers 4 and Pirates of the Caribbean 4, even if they make another one (like they did with those franchises,) I won't be watching another one.

59,"It's four years after Isla Nublar. Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Deering (Bryce Dallas Howard) are hiding Maisie from the world. Dinosaurs are roaming the world. Biosyn is a genetics company run by Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) and given the legal rights over them. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) suspects them of reviving an ancient locust which threatens the world food supply. She recruits a reluctant Alan Grant (Sam Neill) to help. They have Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) as their inside man.The franchise is trying to bring together the newer iteration with the original three. Filmmaker Colin Trevorrow seems to be in charge. His success rate is mixed. He has a tendency not to recognize when his films get into awkward positions. In this one, there is a lot of convenient coincidences. There is one section when I'm yelling at the characters to shoot. They have guns and I don't think dinosaurs are bulletproof. I question the world building exercise here. Some of it is silly. I don't mind bringing back the original three. I like continuing their stories and visiting old friends. There is a lot going on with the two sides and I wouldn't mind if they could be connected more smoothly. They only run into the other group because they are both coming after the company. Instead of turning Chris Pratt into Bourne Identity, they could identify Biosyn early on and zero in on Ian Malcolm as their way in. They could be the people to recruit Ellie and Alan. It's a more natural way to connect the two groups. While I love the idea of the locust, I don't understand why they got released. It's a messy movie. This is a lot. It's overloaded. Some of it is fun and I can hold on to that.",Notr

62,"Jurassic World Dominion, the sixth installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, brings the prehistoric saga to a close, or at least a chapter's end, by exploring the precarious coexistence of humans and dinosaurs in a world where the lines between predator and prey have become increasingly blurred. Directed by Colin Trevorrow, who also helmed Jurassic World, the film attempts to tie together loose ends from previous installments while introducing new threats and ethical dilemmas.Dominion picks up several years after the events of Fallen Kingdom, where dinosaurs have escaped into the wild and are now scattered across the globe. The narrative is split into two primary storylines. One follows Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) as they strive to protect Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), a cloned human with unique genetic significance, from those who wish to exploit her. Their journey intertwines with the efforts of Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who are investigating the genetically modified locusts created by Biosyn Genetics, a powerful corporation with nefarious intentions.Biosyn, led by the ambitious and morally ambiguous CEO Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott), plays a central role in Dominion. Dodgson's plan to control the world's food supply using his engineered locusts, while simultaneously studying dinosaurs for potential medical advancements, creates a dangerous and ethically murky landscape. The film raises pertinent questions about genetic manipulation, corporate greed, and the potential consequences of playing God.The film's visual effects are, as expected, spectacular. The dinosaurs are rendered with impressive realism, and the action sequences, particularly those involving the larger predatory species, are thrilling. The variety of dinosaurs showcased is also a highlight, with some new and visually striking creatures making their franchise debut. However, the sheer number of dinosaurs and the constant barrage of action sometimes overshadow the narrative and character development.One of the most anticipated aspects of Dominion was the return of the original Jurassic Park trio. While their presence adds a nostalgic element and their characters are given moments to shine, their integration into the main plot feels somewhat forced. Their storyline, while connected to the larger narrative, could have been more seamlessly woven into the primary plot involving Owen, Claire, and Maisie.Dominion attempts to address the long-standing theme of humanity's responsibility towards the natural world and the consequences of its actions. The film underscores the dangers of unchecked scientific ambition and the potential for ecological disaster when powerful forces prioritize profit over preservation. However, these themes, while present, are not explored with the depth they deserve. The film often prioritizes spectacle over substance, leaving some of the more complex ethical questions raised by the narrative underdeveloped.Despite its flaws, Jurassic World Dominion offers a visually impressive and action-packed conclusion to the Jurassic Park saga. It provides a sense of closure for long-time fans of the franchise, even if that closure feels somewhat rushed and superficial. The film's exploration of a world where dinosaurs and humans must coexist, while intriguing, ultimately falls short of its potential. While Dominion delivers thrilling dinosaur encounters and nostalgic moments, it ultimately fails to fully grapple with the complex ethical and ecological questions it raises, leaving the future of this prehistoric world somewhat uncertain.",Notr

66,"I am just going to start this review off by stating this film is getting beyond too much hate. In fact a huge amount of the critiques are unfounded, inaccurate or hyprocritical. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it great? Maybe not. Is it bad or terrible, or as offensive as these 1/10 reviews would have you believe? No. It's good. Sure it has flaws, it definitely ain't perfect.However from a die hard super fan, who's seen all the films countless times, and the original Jurassic Park being my all time favourite, what I can say is that it was not anywhere close to what the critics or reviews would have you believe.Before I get into the rest, let me state this. The Rise of Skywalker has lines like ""They fly now!"" and somehow Palpatine has returned! IMDb rating? 6.5/10. Furious 7 has Dwayne Johnson rip a minigun off a drone and use it manually after driving a ambulance off a bridge to crash it. Paul Walker also drives a car through three sky scrapers. IMDB rating? 7.3/10. Black Panther, Shang Chi and numerous other MCU films have legit PS2 level CGI...did anyone see the opening sequence to Doctor Strange 2? Yep, 7.3/10, 7.4/10 & 7.3/10 respectively for those films.This film is currently sitting at 6/10 with only 10k votes, and IMDb tends to see things only drop. So my point is, does this film deserve all this hate, especially when you compare it to other films rated here? Well, no, it quite frankly is just unfair how many vague, brainless and cynical 1/10, 2/10 and 3/10 reviews are here. You don't have to like the film, but review fairly. This film, is at worst, mediocre. But I believe it's far more than that, both as a JP fan but also just as a crafted film.No Way Home, let's use that for comparison. Decent acting? Check. A long run time, fairly messy, yet fun script and story? Check. Some humor? Check. References and callbacks? Check. Return of some iconic characters, fan service and world building? Check. A decent score that probably uses a lot of old tracks from prior films? Check. Good cinematography? Check. Good CGI and practical effects?No, I'd say NWH is lacking there. And you know what? Dominion is near identical in every single category! Yet...NWH has 8.3/10 and Dominion has 6/10. You see the pattern here? This film is copping ridiculous amounts of hate. You don't have to be an award winning classic, an indie film or a Comic Book movie to be good.Jurassic World Dominion is completely faithful and respectful to the legacy of all the films, the franchise itself and Michael Critchon's work.It has beautiful cinematography, amazing CGI and awesome use of practical effects. It builds on the world and lore, and Giacchion's score is awesome as always. Grant feels like Grant. Ellie feels like Ellie. Malcolm feels like Malcolm. Owen and Claire are better than they've been, and Maisie (clone girl) is handled really well. The discourse around human cloning and the locust are straight out of Michael Critchon's work - Timeline, Micro, Westworld, Jurassic Park. Man playing god, manipulating nature and corporate greed.Dominion puts the dinosaurs back a seat and focuses on the humans - yet people complain? Everyone praises the minimal use of the dinosaurs in the original, and states it's about man's misuse of technology and character arcs, whether it be Alan or Hammond. This film does the same. Heck they even got Dogdson back, just like the novels!Does this film feature some wonky dialogue, some cheesy moments and plot conveniance? Sure. But it's not pure garbage.It's staggering how many people use the word ""dumb"". Yet...where is this film dumb? Like where, seriously? I LOVE the other films, but they for sure have dumb moments or moments where logic gone. But this film surprisingly doesn't! Every decision, whether it be by Owen, or Claire or Grant or whoever, is the logical choice. There's not even any suspend your belief stunts or plot armor. The characters just genuinely navigate the locations well. No dumb dino prices, no militarised hybrids, no stupid decisions leading to chaos.Heck people said they want less trained raptors and Blue, less ""Fast & Furious over the top action"", less Rexy saving the day, and more human content/character work.Well guess what? They gave us that. It's funny we have people saying too much dinosaurs then people saying not enough dinosaurs.What happened to being able to enjoy a summer block buster? This film is fun, enjoyable, nostalgic and true to it's roots. Half the negative reviews here don't even state any examples or evidence, they're just the typical ""Hollywood bad"" or ""sequel bad"". Don't get me wrong, I've hated plenty of films, but this film surely isn't any bit close to the current rating.My only real major gripes is despite the long run time and a huge cast, there weren't enough casualties (even for side characters) and that the prologue should've been kept to open the film.So in conclusion, please rate fairly, please don't be discouraged by reviews, and please form your own opinion. Love it? Great! Meh? Great! Hate it? Great! But don't just jump on the band wagon and don't straight up lie or pretend there's issues without evidence.My final score is, as a fan 9/10, as a film 7.5/10.",Notr

The same dramatic drawn out camera angles on the actors faces as they look either scared, concerned or all-knowing before scrambling to safety just in the nick of time.

76,"The original Jurassic Park is a classic. Steven Spielberg created a sense of wonder with his great direction and some very good CGI and practical effects. It was very sispenful at times but mostly audiences lived the dinosaurs. The scene when we see the T-Rex is one of the great sequences in cinema. Since that first film in 1993 I have gone from not.liking the sequels to ultimately thinking that the franchise never could recreate what made the first film so special...None of the Jurassic Park or Jurassic World films are terrible but none of them hold a candle to the original film.When Jurassic World came out I liked it but it just seemed it wasn't that memorable. Fallen Kingdom came next and I just didn't like it.This new film is being sold as an epic conclusion and they brought back three of the main characters from the first film. So obviously they are selling nostalgia, which is fine and it's been done incessantly since The Force Awakens was so successful. If done right? It works. If not it seems like desperation. Here it is pretty flat. The inclusion of Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler, and Ian Malcolm is to me anti-climactic. Sam Neil, Laura Deen and Jeff Gold Blum are ok as these characters and but it just seems they were brought in for nostalgia and it doesn't work as much as it should. Even though the first film is beloved I don't consider these characters as beloved so it's nice to see them but it's like seeing Harrison Ford as Han in Episode 7. It's of course a fusing of the new characters from the old franchise and the new ones. Chris Pratt is fine as Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire are is ok too but nothing new happens with these characters.The dinosaurs of course are the reason to see these films and some scenes are really well done but again the sense of wonder is gone. The story is just the standard science for profit yarn mixed in with the kidnapping of the cloned girl from Fallen Kingdom. As with so many 3rd parts of a trilogy it is very overstuffed and feels unfocused fur the first half of the running time but once it gets going it does get fun. But like so many blockbusters these days you pretty much forget it by the time you leave the theater.Just average....Grade: C.",Notr

85,"Jurassic World Dominion scrapes away the very last traces of legacy remaining from the original Jurassic Park film (which still stands as a great movie). From the opening few minutes the scene is set for a dumb, unimaginative, tension-free, forgettable and utterly wasteful film.The dinosaurs are either upstaged by insects or relegated to jump-scare caricatures constantly popping out of every dark corner when the movie needs them to.There is no attempt to build up tension, as exemplified in the very opening sequence when the sea monster from the previous film pops up again to zero effect. That opening lasts less than a minute but probably amounted to more than many indie films entire budget.Chris Pratt completes his journey from promising new screen presence to bland franchise prop and together with Bryce Dallas Howard, achieves some sort of record as least amount of on-screen chemistry between a couple.The old crew return but only to prove that decent actors capable of creating interesting on-screen relationships can be totally undermined by a terrible script and poor direction. Meanwhile, new additions to the cast such as Dewanda Wise, Mamoudie Athie and Campbell Scott are devoid of screen charisma, acting ability or anything interesting to contribute. Scott in particular is probably one of the most ineffectual and dull on-screen 'villians' I've ever seen.Every single minute contained something stupid, irritating or unintentionally funny.As just one example, the film begins with the cliche of an exposition News item - designed to get the viewer up to speed - in which the presenter informs the populace that dinosaurs are now a global phenonmenon and have been for quite some time.Stop for a moment and consider if a single dinosaur had really been resurrected in our world, does anybody think that in a 24 hour news culture combined with ubiquitous social media and internet access - that anybody capable of watching the news would be unaware of that fact?On top of this, we are informed that the global death toll attributed to dinosaurs is 37. A minute, you ask? No, 37 in a year. Presumably that's not including the entire ship that just got destroyed by our aforementioned jaws stand-in?In the past fifteen years, 74 people have been killed by cows - in the UK alone. Cows.Allosaurs, pterodactyls and T. Rex are roaming our natural habitat and less people are killed than by accidents with butter knives.Shame on you, Mr Spielberg, for endorsing this trash.",Notr

It's not as thrilling and doesn't have these in-awe moments. But that's OK.

The dinosaurs are barely in it and have little to no effect on the narrative, instead simply used for a few entertaining set pieces and then quickly forgotten.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are somehow given less depth the third time round, making their characters even more forgettable and bland. However, the original cast are obviously great and elevate the extremely weak material given to them.The music by Michael Giacchino is a huge letdown. It does nothing new and is simply content in repeating all the familiar tunes from previous ones but they're not even integrated well, almost always feeling random and out of place.However, the film looks nice overall with visuals that are a league above the average blockbuster.

94,"Tired, bloated and overlong supposedly final film in the Jurassic series (Yea right) finds the legacy characters from Jurassic Park crossing paths with the Jurassic World characters in a film that makes its first major mistake by not only not paring them up sooner (They only meet in the last twenty minutes of the film) but have them run separate and equally dumb storylines that really has nothing to do with dinosaurs or what this film was advertised to do. (Planet of the dinosaurs anyone?) . Of the pair of storylines running in this movie, the mutant locus one, (while it has nothing to do with dinosaurs at all) is the better of the two and the reason why because despite it being still dumb and having nothing to with dinosaurs, it's actually more interesting and better acted. The Jurassic Park characters which includes a rejuvenated and game Sam Neill (who redeems his terrible performance from Jurassic Park 3 ) Laura Dern (Who was barley in Jurassic Park 3, thank god) and a top of his game Jeff Goldblum ( who was in this franchise's only fairly good and solid sequel ""The Lost World"" and mercifully only had few minutes of screen times in its second worst sequel ""Fallen Kingdom"") all try their best with the hooky yet brainless material they are working with and for the most part they succeed. Both Sam Neill and Laura Dern pick up seamlessly their natural chemistry from the original Jurassic Park and it's sweet and compelling while Jeff Goldblum naturally picks up Ian Malcolm's sense of self righteous bitting wit and disarming charm. While the script has some of the worst dialogue all three actors have had to work with, only Goldblum manages to turn the tables on the terrible screenplay he was had to work with some quick witted improvisation that gotten the biggest laughs in the entire movie which has him almost breaking what they call the 4th wall and making fun of most of things that are happening in this film, which is a god sent because Jeff is really telling the audience that he knows this movies sinks and he understands what the audience is going through. A brilliant master stroke that only a great actor like Goldblum can pull off undetected from the director and producers of a film they are working on that they think stinks.The second of the storylines while more action oriented, is not only more dimwitted but lacks focus and is barely even acted at all. It's a continuation of the plot threads that was left over from the last movie and it's tries to recon certain revelations but still ends up worthless and uninspired. Chris Pratt phones in his performance and you can sense he knows this film is not very good. Bryce Dallas Howard tried her best but her character still is as underdeveloped as ever and the only actor who comes out of this storyline with her head high is Dewanda Wise, manages to not only steal the spotlight from Pratt and Howard but her character manages to be a hell of a lot more interesting . Unfortunately, not even her great acting talent can overcome the terrible script that does no one any favors and rips off several action sequences from ""The Borne Ultimatum"" which involves a roof top and motorcycle chase in a foreign city. In this film, those rip off sequences added raptors and James Bond bad guys to chase our heroes in the city of ""Malta"" and even with those added elements, they lacked the kinetic energy and intensity that ""Borne"" movie had in spades.In conclusion, the movie while better than the brain dead ""Fallen Kingdom"", it's still a bloated mess. And despite the game efforts by the returning Jurassic Park cast (Especially a great self aware performance by Jeff Goldblum) and a scene stealing, star making turn by Dewanda Wise, it's probably time to end this franchise before they turn out a movie that is ""Jurassic Park 3"" bad.",Notr

96,"Jurassic Park is a franchise that has been milked to death, that can't be denied. Universal is claiming that Jurassic World: Dominion will be the last of the franchise, and that's probably for the best. They took the extra measure, as most franchises have done this day, of bringing back the original cast - Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum - for this last movie. Well, they credit at least for treating them well, unlike a certain other sci-fi franchise. This aside, Dominion is a thoroughly mediocre blockbuster that contains virtually nothing you've never seen before. Oddly enough, it really wasn't what I expected it to be, for better or for worse.Dominion is essentially two movies in one, with a common link. There's the OG cast going undercover at the BioSyn lab, and there's Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard trying to save Maisie from the corporation. The story with the originals isn't too special, but it was nice to see them, and they still acted like themselves. The plot with the new characters was something completely different. For a while, the movie essentially becomes Taken with dinosaurs. On one hand, it is a fun action scene. On the other hand, this is so far removed from the previous films that it's glaring. When they come together at the end and escape from dinos the old-fashioned way, it's entertaining.One thing this movie does really wrong is that it fails to deliver on the premise set up by Fallen Kingdom's ending. The ending of Fallen Kingdom has it that dinosaurs roam the entire world, not just Isla Nublar. Aside from the beginning and end of Dominion, you'd never know. The writing is bad. The characters don't feel like people, they feel more like tools to get the story going. On the other hand, there are some good things. The visual effects are noticeably improved from the first film, and Michael Giacchino delivered another solid score. Wu got a nice redemption arc. Dominion does have some interesting attributes, but it doesn't necessarily make it a good film. If this really is the end for this franchise, then it's been quite a run. Nothing comes close to the original in the end.",Notr
97,"My review is 2,582 so I feel I can say anything I want because who on earth is going to see this one!!This was the most exhausting movie I've watched in recent memory.So many chases - all with animals, of course. Dinos. The first hour had so many non-stop chases, that it was actually exhausting to watch. I'd have to stop and go do something. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Then back to the chase. If it had a motorcycle in it, it was Chris Pratt.There was one scene that was very much like the bar scene in Star Wars. So all the big movies now are ""borrowing"" from Star Wars. If Tom Cruise in Top Gun 2 could do it, then so could they. It'll be interesting to see how many more movies copy Star Wars.That said, one can only hope that if enough of us point out that we actually see their plagiarisms and call them on it, maybe we can get some original movies out of Hollywood.

Movies exist to entertain us, not just win awards.JP/JW were never super deep movies with deep stories, deep lines and deep everything. They were your normal summer fun films.

That simple.Again, ignore the very bad reviews since they obviously are not able to just enjoy a movie and have fun.

The plot has nothing to do with dinosaurs.You don't miss anything by not watching it. Personally, Jurassic Park is the best film, followed by Lost World, Jurassic Park III, Jurassic World, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, and Dominion. Yes, the films got worse with every new entry. I was least entertained by the previous two entries.I can't help but feel this inconsistent, out-of-place trilogy deserves a quick comparison to the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Jurassic World hits the same beats as The Force Awakens. Rehash anyone? While the setup is there and you can build off it, originality is nonexistent.Then came The Last Jedi, which derailed the Star Wars saga. Fallen Kingdom was just boring. I can't consider it anything better than average. Its plot was nonsensical, and viewers begin to care less about our Jurassic World characters by the end of Act 3. That's never a good thing.Now, Dominion is on par with Rise of Skywalker for being so fast paced, poorly edited, introducing new things (species) every couple of minutes, bringing back dead or old characters for nostalgia bait, abusing special effects and letting action scenes carry the film, etc.Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) lost his charisma in this one. The only times I felt genuinely entertained was seeing Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) make subtle quips. If you want to see Pratt's potential, watch the Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers films.You can skip Fallen Kingdom and Dominion and not miss anything. The story does not make a positive impact on prior films nor does it add substance to the overarching narrative, which is the study of dinosaurs. There's nothing of value here. Give it a few years for the die-hard fans to wake up. The Jurassic World trilogy offers very little re-watchability.",Notr
106,Jurrassic Park was a Pop Culture masterpiece. Sequels will not recapture that initial magic. However I found Jurassic World Dominion fun and satisfying for the most part.

108,"This was terrible in every way. Bad acting, terrible script, bad CGI and stupid decisions (on and off the screen) cannot rely on nostalgia for a good film.1. Ellie is not as stupid as the film makes her out to be, as one of the characters signposts the fact that he is a double agent and she apparently doesn't pick up on it.2. Everyone seems to be phoning in their parts. They know the film will make money, so in their minds why bother I guess? The absolute worst culprit Campbell Scott who plays Dogson- I have no words. He's terrible and I can't tell if it's due to the script or he wasn't right for this part. It might be both. The original cast are awful- they don't seem enthusiastic to be there and I don't blame them.3. The plot makes no sense. After lengthy exposition opening the film we dive headfirst into one bad and nonsensical decision after another. For example, despite knowing that everyone is looking for her Maisie goes into town, despite being told not to, sees a dinosaur at a construction site then comes back. What was the point of this?! And this is just in the first 10 minutes- there are plenty more. Also, Owen is catching Parasaurolophus with a lasso on a horse, despite the fact that if the dinosaur spooks for any reason it will drag both him and the horse along for the ride? He was dragged from the horse already- surely he's learned his lesson?4. The callbacks to the original film take you out of the story. Instead of being subtle they practically scream ""notice me!""5. The CGI is bad and doesn't blend well with the puppets they clearly used in some scenes. I applaud the fact that they are going back to puppetry, but it needs to be seamless with the CGI.6.

However this is still a good movie and I am lucky to have been a child when the first one game out and now being a father watched this with my two sons. They loved this movie saying it was the best.

113,"I've scrolled through so many negative reviews, and they are such BS. People are complaining about things that don't even make sense. Things that every Jurrassic Park movie has always done.Like having coincidences like the characters being in the right place at the right time. I remember being in the theater for Jurrassic park 2 with someone who laughed about that happening.Or one person complained about there being too many new dinosaurs and dinosaur attacks....well if you don't want to see new dinosaurs and more dinosaur attacks, why are you watching another Jurrassic park movie?Then there's the complaint that certain little details aren't realistic. Are you freaking kidding me...it's a sci fi/fantasy film about dinosaurs existing alongside humans....including one GMO dinosaur....and you are going to focus in on little details that aren't realistic? If you want to watch a realistic movie, you have chosen the wrong genre entirely.And then there's the complaint that the story isn't good. Um, what movie were you watching? Because there's very little wrong with the story. It builds upon all of the previous movies just like a good story should. It deals with modern issues and is more relevant to our real world than any of the others have been. It has so many good plot points and story elements. It has a lot of throwbacks to the first one, as well as some very new additions. And it is obvious to me that the people complaining about this story don't know anything about writing and story telling. And it's really just that they don't like the movie.But there's really little wrong with the film making either. Again, nothing that hasn't been wrong with some of the other films. They put a lot of work into making this movie. It looks fantastic. And I think the main reason people are complaining so much is not because of things that are wrong with the film. But because they already stopped being fans of the franchise and at this point it can't do anything right.Because there have been Jurrassic Park films before this that were not very good. And it has been a long time, and it does seem that these people leaving negative reviews are just disgrunted ex fans who are sick of it. And so if you are watching a movie that is over 2 hours long and you are really just sick of the franchise and watching it because you are bored and have nothing else to do (and probably have a bad attitude because of that), that would explain the negative reviews.But it also seems to me that with all the throwbacks to the first film, that anyone who loved the first one should also love this one. So maybe a lot of these people just don't like the genre or this type of movie.However if you are looking for a movie about dinosaurs living alongside humans, and are looking to have fun and don't want something that is serious and based in reality, but is just good cinematic entertainment, and you enjoyed the first film, there's a good chance you will like this one. Don't expect it to fix a bad attitude or anything. If you are the type of person who needs to complain about every little thing, well maybe instead of sitting around judging other peoples work you should get off your ass and try making a movie yourself so you can see how much work it actually is and gain a better appreciation of the art of film and how much actually goes into them. Because as a videographer myself, I tend to appreciate film a lot more because I have an understanding of these things that most people don't. And I find it ridiculous when I hear people complaining like this, in ways that make no sense and show that they don't know jack about film and are probably just a negative and pathetic excuse for a human being who entertains themselves by watching movies they aren't really into and then complaining about them.In my honest opinion, this film is the second best in the series next to the first one. There was so much about it that I loved. So much that they did right that I thought was absolute pure gold. So many amazing movie moments that made me want to just applaud them. It's a travesty that all of these internet trolls who probably couldn't even properly frame a shot aren't being fair to it. But I guess thats just how people are these days.",Notr

116,"Essentially ""Jurassic World Dominion"" is just a rather weak storyline based on nostalgia and following the same formula throughout the course of the entire movie.But I am getting ahead of myself here. Sure, I was thrilled to sit down and watch the 2022 movie ""Jurassic World Dominion"", as a conclusion to the movies. And I will say that the movie definitely was off with a bang.The storyline in ""Jurassic World Dominion"", as written by Emily Carmichael, Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly was a bit weak. And by that I mean it wasn't a rather wholesome or particularly profound and deep storyline here. It was essentially just taking the protagonists of the movie, which now included members of the original ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy, members of the ""Jurassic World"" trilogy and some new ones, and having them move from A to B while intercepted by a dangerous dinosaur, then move from B to C while intercepted by a dangerous dinosaur, and moving from C to D while intercepted by, and you guessed it, a dangerous dinosaur but also by oversized mutated locusts this time.The writers cater a lot to viewers of the original trilogy with lots of props and events that you can recognize if you have watched and enjoyed the first trilogy. And sure, it does work, but it just becomes a little bit tacky as the movie progresses. But at the same time it was also somewhat enjoyable to watch things again on the screen that was seen or done in other movies in the franchise, sort of the circling being completed in a way.Visually then ""Jurassic World Dominion"" was phenomenal. The special effects and CGI team really are working magic to brink the dinosaurs and the world to life. I enjoyed this CGI extravagance, and it is actually a major part of the movie. If a movie like ""Jurassic World Dominion"" had dubious CGI, it just wouldn't work. But luckily the CGI here is amazing to look at; pure eye-candy.The movie does have a good cast ensemble. It is a cast ensemble that unites the members of the original trilogy with those of the new trilogy; so you have Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum teaming up with Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Isabella Sermon. And the movie also have a wonderful appearance by BD Wong, and also by DeWanda Wise. I am not sure about whether or not I really liked Campbell Scott's part in the movie, sure I liked his performance, but the character was just too much something resembling Steve Jobs.""Jurassic World Dominion"" is a movie that is worth watching if you have enjoyed the five previous movies, of course it is. And it is entertaining enough for what it turns out to be. Sure, I wasn't expecting director Colin Trevorrow to re-invent the wheel here with this 2022 action adventure. If for nothing else, then watch ""Jurassic World Dominion"" for the special effects and CGI.The whole concept of humans and the wildlife of today's world coexisting with dinosaurs was just a bit far fetched for my liking. But hey, it looked good - and sappy - on the screen.My rating of ""Jurassic World Dominion"" lands on a solid six out of ten stars. It is definitely well worth the time.",Notr

If already in the first two of the World saga, the creatures have completely stopped behaving like animals but have been humanized to excess (do you remember the smile of the indoraptor? I remember it while I sleep), here they are a simple outline to totally unrelated events. The cast is simply out of control.

Pretty much every scene that occurred I was waiting for Vin Diesel to show up and say something about family.I think I speak for everyone when I say we don't want laser pen controlled Raptors chasing Chris Pratt around Malta on a motorbike. If there's anyone out there who disagrees, I hope you are happy.At this point I think this franchise needs to call it quits and that's coming from someone who has a special place in their heart for Jurassic Park and dinosaurs in general.Seriously, how did the dinosaurs look better in 1993 than they do now hahahaha.",Notr
122,"I rated Jurassic World Dominion with a seven because I like that kind of movies, adventures with prehistoric animals but in all fairness the story wasn't the greatest. It was much too exaggerated, much too simple at times, and the acting was sometimes not that great either. I've never been a big fan of Chris Pratt, think he's just a mediocre actor and that didn't change with this movie. And Laura Dern isn't an actress I appreciate a lot either so those two combined isn't a success formula for me. The only reason I score it this high, maybe too high, is because of the CGI's which were very good, and that's what made it entertaining. Maybe it's time to call it a day with the Jurassic franchise.

123,"The film is of course not innovative and is also a film where two worlds come together. And to finish it off well, it's not going well. The cast of the first three films and the last two. And then a story has to be made of it. And that's where it goes wrong. Just like the montages. The story is also not accurate in time. And the dolomites is a huge area. And yet the beasts can get inside in a short time. In short, the film has to rely on the dinosaurs, locations, humor, scary moments and good film images. The film survives that.

The threat from them was also non existent. I wanted to love this movie but simply could not.

They tried to put some disturbing plot into play, but it hadn't much of a use. For me it's all about the suspense/action parts, and some of the scenes were all bit the same thing I have seen before. I think the best action sequence was the scene in Malta. Well edited and amazing camera work. I loved DeWanda Wise, she gave a lot of flair to her performance. Absolutely loved to see the original 3 have a big part in the movie (Laura Dern cracks me up!). And Bryce Dallas Howard always puts on a great, scary performance.

136,"At 2 hours and 26 minutes, this marks the longest movie in the Jurassic series. May he Rest In Peace, but it's probably good that Michael Crichton wasn't alive to see this abomination of a film. The only reason I'm even giving an extra star is because the dinosaurs looked good and some of the cinematography was on point, but my god this was unbearable to watch.My biggest problem with this film is how predictable the story was and how shallow of a character its antagonist was. Nothing against Campbell Scott, I'm sure he's a swell guy, but watching him play this character was like watching a lifeless Dave Wallace from The Office. He had no depth, no angle, and every choice he made could be seen from 100 miles away.Another reason I couldn't stand this movie was how many times Chris Pratt got everyone out of trouble by putting his hand up to the dinosaurs. I can't tell you how badly I wanted him to try it just to have one of them take a couple fingers off. It might've added some excitement to the movie.I really wish I could keep going and tell you about how bad the whole thing was; but since I fell asleep for fifteen minutes of the movie, I guess it wouldn't be very honest of me to say I saw the entire thing. This is supposed to be the last movie of the series, so I was expecting some crazy things to be happening. I wanted to see dinosaurs fighting in the city, knocking into buildings, and stepping on cars. Instead, we were served a recycled plot with generic action and storytelling.Give me a job, Universal, and I'll write a better script with my eyes closed.

There's some call backs to Kenner artwork which felt like a nice touch. Jeff Goldblum in my opinion carried this film. His character felt the most important. You should never go into this film expecting an Oscar winning script. These films have never made sense so when you apply realism to this franchise resort it to the dinosaurs.

148,"IN A NUTSHELL:
I readily admit that I have been a huge fan of this dinosaur franchise since the very beginning. Not all of the movies in the series have been as good as others, but I've still enjoyed each one. From Jurassic World architect and director Colin Trevorrow, Dominion takes place four years after Isla Nublar has been destroyed. Dinosaurs now live-and hunt-alongside humans all over the world. This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history's most fearsome creatures.Movie Review Mom GRADE: BTHINGS I LIKED:
I absolutely loved, loved, seeing the original cast members blend with the newer ones from the final trilogy. So fun! When Chris Pratt found out the old cast was returning, he excitedly claimed, ""Just in case you hadn't seen the news. It's finally happening. Get ready for what is absolutely, without a doubt going to be the biggest, baddest and best, movie of the franchise."" He also described this final episode like the Marvel ""Endgame"" of the Jurassic franchise.The cast includes Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Lauren Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill, BD Wong, Campbell Scott, Mamoudou Athie, Omar Sy, among others.There are plenty of action sequences. Chris Pratt dropped weight and gained muscles to be in sharp form and is still absolutely believable as the action hero in the movie.I loved that there was a plausible reason for bringing back a biologist and dinosaur expert in this movie.We're also introduced to some new characters.As filmmaking technology improves, the CGI of these movies gets more and more incredible. Even still, this addition to the franchise has even more animatronics than the last 2.There are a lot of respectful nods to the first movie, which made me so happy. Easter eggs abound in visual and spoken forms.We get to see a new kind of dinosaur called a ""Pyroraptor."" Fun! It was a real dinosaur recently discovered, but its size was supposedly smaller than a turkey.We get to travel to destinations around the world.It cracked me up when Jeff Goldblum's shirt was open and he said, ""Oh!"" ha ha He had some of the best lines of the movie, as always. There are a few moments worthy of a chuckle.Every dinosaur we know and love from the previous movies gets a decent amount of screen time.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The last time we saw Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant, they were good friends, so I was surprised when they didn't even hug each other when they were first reunited in this movie.I was surprised by the high number of bad editing moments.I'm sure I'm not the only Jeff Goldblum fan who wanted a more epic moment when we first saw him on screen in this movie.There has been some criticism about the believability of the plot. Agreed.It has been stated that this will NOT be the last film in the Jurassic Park franchise. Did you want this to be? Are you ready for more?It's not really well explained how the land dinosaurs migrated to all of the continents around the world, just that they did.Some of the new characters just aren't very compelling. Some are even annoying.The plot and scenes are pretty chaotic and scattered.I admit that the tension seemed fairly low simply because our favorite characters never seem to die. I wasn't really worried about them and didn't feel as emotionally invested in them as I was in the very first movie. SPOILER: Who knew just holding your hand out in front of a dinosaur was all it took?Soooo many lines are repeated word for word from previous movies in the franchise. The first few times, it was charming, but then it kind of seemed manipulative and even lazy. A lot of the dialogue is clunky. Because of that, some of the acting suffers.Is it terrible and crazy to admit that I was a little bit bored at times?The villains are definitely underwhelming.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

I've heard a directors cut is coming out, so I do hope it will tidy up the film. It was fun and great to see a mix of the original and sequel casts coming together. I look forward to seeing it again when released on blu ray/iTunes. There were alot of special dinosaur scenes which I loved, but the fact that the films story stretched too so many areas.

The chemistry between the old and new cast worked great. There are many shots/scenes which are really cinematic and look absolutely gorgeous.Overall story/plot is okay but messy, great cast and chemistry, cool dinosaurs that usually don't get enough spotlight, some really cool looking scenes which I would love to have as a wallpaper and lots of fanservice and callbacks to the old movies.",Notr

The main attraction is, of course, the dinosaurs. The CGI on the dinosaurs was really well done and the action scenes are a thrill to watch! But it does feel like, after five movies, the 'magic' of seeing these dinosaurs on screen is a bit gone. Especially when there is not a big bad evil dinosaur this movie focusses on, like there was in the other jurassic world movies (indominus rex and indoraptor).The acting in this movie was fine, but not outstanding and the plot was, as mentioned, okay at best.

All the performances are very very awful, even the original cast acted so bad (and we're talking about people like Laura Dern, Sam Neil and Jeff Goldblum). The plot it's so dumb and occasionally nosense! Also photography, directing, visual effects and editing are very low tier if we think about the franchise and the budget!!",Notr

169,"Having grown up in the 90's Jurassic Park was a big part of my life. I have enjoyed the movies for years. This newest movie is fantastic. I loved it, as did the five other people I went with. It was fun to see all the separate stories come together, and seeing old favorites was exciting. It was all really well done...acting, effects, music, writing, the action, the humor. If you can't enjoy a movie like this, then you want too much.Gone are the days when people can just go to a movie and enjoy it as it is, and not expect it to change their entire life. Movies are meant to be enjoyed, they are meant to take you away for a short time. When did it stop being like that? If you want to be shocked, and scared, and changed...watch the freakin news.",Notr

171,"I will try to keep it short as possible.Starts off as a typical low budget nonsense movie made by college kids then slowly starts to make some sense and rolls out into a coherent plot.The entire setting is completely unrealistic. Ironic it might sound since its fiction but still the main point of my argument is that people would not survive in the world full of dinosaurs. Allegedly the dinos spread the entire world, yeah that means humans would either extinct or be in survival mode.One time they say how living with dinos is a struggle (especially pointed out in the intro) the next we are shown places and events like dinos don't exist at all and somehow the locusts are the only problem...
No other problems, no dinos to make a mess etc. Like make up your mind.The events in the movie are completely off, all the characters would pretty much die off in their 1st crashes and especially their 1st encounters with dinos but they somehow always survive and find their way to a secure place, or secure enough. Magically only the villians get killed almost instant, like magically dinos know who is ''good'' or ''bad''. When a good character is attacked the dinos basically more often just toy around they don't attack for a kill.In the real world, we don't need locusts and dinosaurs to be a problem, we are the biggest problem and we are our own enemy ... the movie seems like a metaphor for a typical brainwashed human behavior, blame everything else but us.This movie is such a mishmash of things, it's like trying hard to please every fanbase there is. Campy horror, JP3 fans (do they even exist...) bringing back old characters and putting lots of nods to old JP1 and 2 but still manage to middle finger it too... this movie seriously doesn't know what it wants to be at all.",Notr
172,"Its a generic hollywood blockbuster. Like the other 5 movies before. The story in all movies: people running away and hide from dinos. Thats all. Why do we watch this?

I'm not expecting to see some thought provoking, mind blowing movie with this one. I was entertained and would recommend to anyone else wanting to watch the movie.",Notr
174,"The worst thing about writing this review is that I had extremely high hopes for watching this movie. I remember watching the original as a little boy in the theaters being blown away at the ground breaking effects and breakthrough in filmmaking. I was excited to watch this movie with my own children, hoping it would somehow be a repeat of the magic I experienced watching the first one. I also thought thought that this was going to be some sort of homage to the magic of the first movie since they brought back the original cast. When the movie starts, there is no build up to seeing the dinosaurs all of a sudden they just live amongst everyone and the magic of seeing a dinosaur is completely null. I thought there was going to be a very emotional sentiment by seeing the original cast however, it didn't bring any added value other than viewers who remember the original to say oh hey, there they are. The action feels generic, and there was never any points during the movie that gave you the suspense we all experienced during the first one. This was one of the biggest letdowns I have ever had.",Notr
175,"Well, well, well. I had so much hope for this movie, I anticipated something really grandiose, but it derailed somewhere.The plot itself was mediocre, but it was obvious, these movies are not really about the plot itself. Maybe, it could have been better with less character lines. I know, I know, it had a great feeling that everyone came back again, and we had new faces, but because of that it became superficial.CGI itself, good as always. The dinosaurs were great, their movement, fight scenes and the landscapes as well where we could find them. However I could not understood, why they had to finish the movie with that fight scene. I don't really see the point in it, but it is my problem.2,5 hours of playing time. Too much, definitely. You get so many boredom parts in the movie, which scenes are not neccessary in my opinion. I was anticipated a little more fights with that screen time.Overall, it was not the worst movie ever, but definitely the worst, out of the 3 movies. I don't regret that I spent money on it, but it is not going to become my favourite. If you have some superfluous time and money, it worth a movie ticket.",Notr
176,"Bad acting or directing? Maybe too small a sound stage with too much green screen? Everybody always seemed to be standing so close to each other. I dunno, it felt low-budget, and maybe even lazy because they didn't seem to be trying to being anything new to the table. Just resting on their laurels to bring in the views.Anyway, I didn't feel the nostalgia for the first movie like I think I was supposed to, I used the fast-forward button a lot - which I never do the first time I watch a film - and I just couldn't find myself ""in it"" like I did in most of the others.It's too bad, too, because I would really have liked to feel that nostalgia and I *really* wanted to suspend my disbelief.This is a rare review from me. I'm actually sorry that I felt I needed to write it.",Notr

It felt like closing the circle with the iconic first movie. Perhaps people keep expecting another experience like in 1993, but that's impossible because that was the only time we were able to be vowed by a very first seemingly realistic look at dinosaurs. It was mind blowing. But that can never be recreated.Of course, this installment has no unexpected plot. If it did, THAT would actually kill the vibe. This movie is based on nostalgia, on the joy of getting the old trio of Laura Dern, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum back together and them meeting the Jurassic World leads.We were very pleasantly surprised and liked 6 better than 4 and 5.

183,It was a great way to end the series. It was great seeing all the original characters back from the first movie in 1993. So long ago. I give them credit for showing how mankind lives with dinosaurs now instead of the usual dinosaurs escaping from captivity and they have to out run them. There were a few points in the movie where the dialogue seemed choppy however there was plenty of action and plenty of dinosaurs and I thought the actors were terrific. I saw Top Gun Maverick a few weeks ago which is a repeat from an older movie and I thought they did a better job on that one however Jurassic World is still very good!,Notr
184,"One of worst written and directed big budget movies I've seen in a long time. Made Transformers look like Seventh Seal.It starts with the 4 minutes of narration at the beginning to try to make the rest of it make any kind of sense. This fails. Then there are the other obvious re-shot or dubbed lines to try to make things make sense. These also fail.Forget the black ops CIA agents easily defeating humans armed with machine guns, then throwing their guns down and turning their backs when confronted with some dinosaurs trained to literally run up and bite them. Forget that the controls for the mainframe that needs to be turned off is in the same room where they kept the experimental grasshoppers and which had been soaked in lighter fluid and set on fire earlier. Forget that restarting the mainframe also brought the grasshoppers who were burned to a crisp hours earlier back to life. Forget all that, and answer this: Did Kayla steal that airplane from Baloo from TailSpin? It's obviously the same plane, did she pay for it? Do talking bear pilots exist in the Jurassic Park universe?",Notr

186,"'Jurassic World Dominion' (or Jurassic Park 6) is the presumed end of this second trilogy. It primarily follows Owen (Pratt), Claire (Howard) & their adopted daughter Maisie (Sermon), as she's hunted/kidnapped by bad guys that think she's a clone. Then they throw in the original team of Ellie (Dern), Alan (Neill, struggling to find his accent from the original film) and Ian (Goldblum) who are working to bring down Biosyn Corp and their GE locusts, led by Dodgson (Scott). They have help from Kayla (Wise), Ramsay (Athie) and Barry (Sy), and BD Wong is also back as Dr Wu.While the premise of dinosaurs roaming wild is an interesting concept, it's not fully explored and only hinted at in parts. Where it is shown, such as Owen wrangling the Parasaurolophus, there's more questions as to the potential realness of it, i.e. Reptiles living in the snow, horses being as fast as them, their calmness. There's a lot of ""really?!"" moments in this film. There's some funny moments and some good action scenes, but it all seems to have too many chefs and lack focus/seems rushed.This is nowhere near the quality of the original film - probably slightly better than 'Jurassic Park III' and 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom', not that that means much. Oddly, while we see a few dinosaurs, including some new ones, but mostly the tried & tested favourites - there seems to be not that many scenes where dinosaurs are the main focus. While not horribly slow, it doesn't feel like it all comes together and starts working until the final 40min, which isn't much of the 2 hour 20min running time.",Notr

They should of killed off some of the characters in this movie cause any one who is about to die (get eaten by a dinosaur) another character will arrive just in time to save them, I mean come on this is final movie why didn't they kill off anyone, the only characters that die is the villain, and random background characters. Owen's daughter ( I don't remember her name nor do I care) just says something sassy, and has zero character even though she is the plot of this movie.

190,"Jurassic Park was my childhood. When the movie came out in theaters, I was only 1 years old. I remember owning Jurassic Park years later on vhs, and it becoming one of my most prized possessions. The story, characters, pacing, special effects, and music are pitch perfect. When the Lost World: Jurassic Park came out, I was 5 years old, and I did not see it in theaters either. While it was a flawed sequel, I enjoyed watching it on vhs. The music, set pieces, and the inclusion of more dinosaurs made it a fun addition to the series. Jurassic Park III was the first film in the franchise that I actually saw in theaters in 2001. I remember loving it when I was 9 years old, but now it is my least favorite of the sequels. The runtime is too short, and I'm not just referring to humans running away from dinosaurs. The dialogue and characters and poorly written, and the quality of the cgi was downgraded. With that being said, the animatronic work still mostly holds up, except the Spinosaurus. Fast forward 14 and 17 years later, and I finally saw both Jurassic World and Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom in theaters. The experience of seeing the park finally open in Jurassic World was such an en incredible feeling. It was the closest to capturing the magic of the original Jurassic Park. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, like Jurassic Park III, tends to get better when repeat watches, but it is a lesser sequel in almost every way. This brings me to Jurassic World Dominion. While the film does have tonal issues and missteps, seeing the original trio together is worth the price of admission alone. While I think the current reviews are a bit harsh, the film is flawed. I would summarize the biggest issue as missed opportunities for the characters and story. The movie wraps up all six films in an interesting enough way, but doesn't completely satisfy or answer every question that you may have. Visually, the movie is gorgeous, and it has the most animatronics of any film in the franchise, with the cgi mixing well with the practical effects. Overall, Jurassic World Dominion is a nostalgic rollercoaster ride that thrilled me, slightly disappointed me, but never bored me.",Notr
191,"Top Gun sequel took 4 or 5 steps up compared to the first, while Dominion took 4 or 5 steps down. There were a lot of action scenes that were OK to watch, and some were actual fun to.

192,Lots of meaningless action. Same old boring predictable near death experiences. Feels like it was written so badly to make sure it's the last one. Script older than the dinosaurs.

But they don't care anymore; it's been done to death and even the script writer's busy going to parties, getting high and smashing French champagne.

Some fun, some intense, and creative dinosaur action happened, and it was engaging. With that said...The story had potential. It was handled very poorly. I wished that they made me truly care about these characters, particularly Chris Pratt, and Bryce Dallas Howard, but the character arcs were weak sadly. Instead of developing interesting character arcs, that got replaced with the nostalgia factor, (which for the record, Sam Neil, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum still got it.)And honestly the film itself could've been shorter. It did feel like it dragged on unfortunately. There were also some character decisions that kind of made scratch my head and was like, ""huh?"" The music was forgettable unfortunately. There's a lot of flaws to this film that I could list. But, there is still some fun that could be found in this. One watch is enough.C-",Notr

200,"If you are a fan of dinosaurs fighting each other, this movie is for you. If you are a fan of suspenseful moments where dinosaurs are hunting humans and the humans are trying to escape death, boy, you're in for a real treat. I was in awe by the action scenes in this movie and how realistic the graphics of the dinosaurs were. The last section of the movie is packed with dinosaur fighting scenes, you'll love it. There were a few notable scenes, especially the ones with the baby raptor dinosaur, where it looked TOO fake with too much CGI because it didn't blend well with the forest background. It didn't detract too much from the immersion of the movie but it was definitely noticeable.The story was decent. It does a decent job of recapping the previous movie story a little bit. You will greatly benefit if you remember what happened in the earlier movies because they pretty much get into the story and continue it. The relationship between the characters will make much more sense if you remember what they did in the past. I didn't like how the movie just drops newly introduced characters. Especially in the first half, there are times where they introduce a new actor and then the story changes locations and you never see that actor again. They introduce dinosaurs that react to lazer pointers but you never see them again after that.I'm not a big fan of the middle part since it drags on a little bit. The part where people are sneaking into the lab and there's heavy dialog wasn't presented interesting enough to me..The acting is superb from all the actors. The way they acted terrified from these fake CGI dinosaurs were very believable. Jeff Goldblum was funny and talked eloquently as he always does. The audience at my movie theatre laughed at some of his dialog. I didn't see the other jurassic park movies from the 90's with the original actors. But i still felt like i this was going to be epic when the original actors and the new actors from the jurassic world story arc joined together.I'm not a huge fan of the villain, he was evil but his motivation other than greed money was kinda shallow. He was also kind of weak, depending totally on his workers to just blindly follow him.All in all, come for the action and suspense. You'll appreciate this movie so much more if you remember the previous movies and if you know the actors from their other movies.",Notr

Yes, the original cast was reunited and that would normally make the film better, but the movie just felt rushed and the actors just didn't have that spark that they did in previous movies. I would have liked to see much more dinosaur action, though. I mean, if you're going to give us a confusing enough storyline to follow that branches off into so many directions in Dominion, at least include the animal that made the franchise so popular. Maisie was really annoying and just not a likable character, and her storyline was very stupid, in my opinion. She was just another character, easily forgettable. I ended up almost falling asleep because Dominion was just so boring and the storyline was hard to catch up with. Watched it with my grandparents in the theater and was very underwhelmed, and watched it with my parents and they said it was garbage. It's a shame, because the movie had so much potential, but they didn't plan it out right and it was just another forgettable film of 2022. Very disappointed in the movie.",Notr
203,Well......i went to see this with low expectations after the reviews i read and the negative comments and although the movie indeed suffered here and there and had serious flaws still overall it was enjoyable and had more positives than negatives so it was better than i expected it to be.Overall.......first half an hour was not bad although it could have done more with the story and it was great to see the couple from the jurassic world 1 and 2 films now living together up in the woods with that kid but after that we got like another half an hour of useless chaces with dinos in a kind of a city like mad max atmosphere boredoom but then the movie was fixed and last half an hour was great showing an epic battle between t-rex and gigantosaurus but there should have been more dino battles during the film. Overall not near as good as the previous two JW films but still it was above average and on the plus u get to see also dr alan grant and his love affair from the original 1993 film and of course jeff was back as well. The original cast we all loved was a plus and reason enough to watch this film.

But by all means, this movie was good, but not great. I didn't enjoy jurassic world because it felt like a bad attempt at a remake of jurassic park. And don't get me started on fallen kingdom, I don't know how I sat through that movie when it was in theaters. It was just so awful, the worst jurassic movie of them all. So my expectations for this movie were pretty low. This is what the first jurassic world movie should have been. It reminded me of the rise of the planet of the apes series. But, If you're looking for a realistic interpretation of how dinosaurs would live among humans, this movie isn't for you. This movie is purely entertainment. If it were realistic the main characters would've been dead a long time ago. The action can be cheesy and predictable, but it's fun, and some of the action sequences had me ready to jump, something i haven't felt since the first jurassic park. This movie was definitely carried by the return of the original jurassic park cast, i would not have enjoyed it as much as i did if they weren't in it. This movie actually felt like it had somewhat of a plot. And somehow still doesn't feel like the end of the series.

211,"The build up to this feature seems somewhat fake: being the idea that we'll see the world ravaged by the impact of these dinosaurs finally free to live unfettered and feast on the 7 billion of us, many of whom anticipated a thrilling end to the saga. Even the title ""Dominion"" suggests some victorious claimant of Terra Firma as we expect to be the ones cast back into evolutionary obscurity in a battle which humans haven't a chance of winning. Well, that's what it suggested anyway, the trailer, the title, that we'd see the world overrun. But instead, the writers seem to have shuffled through all of the prior films and screenplays and then finally picked up Michael Crichton's first book and said, ""eh I've bright idea ... let's set it in a park for Dinosaurs like l, eh I dunno ... Jurassic Park maybe, huh?"" Duh!And that's precisely what we get, Jurassic Park again, only worse, way worse. Couple that with rubber animatronics, bad CGI, wooden acting and we're left with a giant pile of Dino-dung that stinks. Any menace one might have expected from the world being the dominion of these creatures dissappears when they decided to concentrate on an environmental disaster caused by locusts the size of rats and forget that there are flocks of Pterosaurs on high that just might eat the kids for lunch, but they won't because we've decided that we can all hold a hand up in a staying manner and control every single one of them, and if that doesn't work we'll just get Chris Pratt to talk to them, he's great at that and they seem to like his voice. He even teaches Dr Grant how to hold a hand up to a Velociraptor, unaware that Dr Grant perfected the staying hand in JP III.And the decision to have the Pilot for hire explain to the dinosaur trainer and the former head of Jurassic World the names and characteristics of certain dinosaurs seems so lazy and ill-thought out as to be ridiculous. It is an obvious attempt to give the character lines, but simply isn't believable.If only the writers of this rubbish would embrace prehistory, for their work certainly needs somewhere to go to, preferably into obscurity.Instead they brush over the fact that the thing which was to avoided at all costs throughout all of the prior movies, that these animals shouldn't ever be set free, really isn't that bad and we'll all have to learn to share. It's an insulting side-step, insulting to fans, and to concentrate the majority of the film in yet another Dinosaur park, left me dumbfounded, I still can't believe they went there.The return of the original cast was largely wasted and there was no intelligent integration of their roles with the Jurassic World cast, it was a wasted opportunity and the promise of the trailers and excitement at this merging was squandered. The one sure thing to create atmosphere, John William's renowned score was also wasted and the music at times was so bad, it sounded like a score for any generic TV action show. Only hints of the original score surfaced and were so clipped as to be annoying and pointless.If they had crowd-sourced ideas from the fans and thrown it all in the air and grabbed what they could, they could have done way better than what was written here. And, I can only say that the opening to this film is one of the most crappy wasted opportunities of all the franchise, opening with some ridiculous newsreader monologue segment as a mechanism to get the story into our heads. It was terrible and some of the worst writing I've seen across a franchise known for enticing, exciting openings. It seems the old saying, too many cooks spoil the broth, is appropriate to the writing here.The acting seems rushed, unfocused, and unrehearsed and a lot of that is down to the director, who is ultimately responsible for shouting cut. Overall, it's a huge disjointed, disappointment that even the cast seem perplexed by.If looking for wonder, rewatch the original, if you do so after watching this mess, then you'll realise exactly how bad it is.",Notr
212,"If you liked the Jurassic Worlds (1&2) and loved Jurassic Park (1), you'll have loads of things to like in this movie too. But I'm biased, the movie has dinosaurs, was filmed partly in Malta while I lived there (we had news of the movie every day haha) AND in my favourite place on earth: the Dolomites.",Notr
213,"This movie is amazingly bad. A series of scenes which don't seem to have a real connection, but angry dinosaurs being involved. It seems like seeing the same sequence multiple times, once in a city, a forest, a frozen lake, but it's basically all the same. What really baffles me is the complete lack of character development. Basically every character remains flat and ends up where he has been before. This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time.",Notr
214,"I went into this 6th instalment of the Jurassic saga with a lot of trepidation. All the negative reviews had me lower my expectations.And you know what? It's not as awful as everyone made it out to be.Not as good as the original trilogy nor the 4th entry, Jurassic World. But it's definitely miles better than Forbidden Kingdom.Having the original trio of Neill, Dern and Goldblum reprising their classic roles, did bring more nostalgia than I anticipated. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, the hero's of the new trilogy, were definitely pushed into the backseat for this new film.But it was fun popcorn entertainment with some stunning visuals and action packed set pieces laced with tension.Sure, the whole ""locust"" subplot felt out of place and stupid, but it didn't impact my enjoyment one bit.It's a fine addition to the franchise. Maybe not the send off we wanted, but not awful either.",Notr
215,"I rarely blame the writer for a bad movie as more than often it's the result of a studio or producer's ego - but the writing was objectively poor.The industry has been so hot on Carmichael for awhile, and honestly, it seems like she had never even watched Jurassic Park or read Crichton's books. It felt more like Fast & Furious plus dinosaurs with sappy dialogue and non-sensical plot points, one after another. And even though we have an army of characters that barely got any development, the story insisted on introducing more, which were boring additions.Clearly this story also was pushing some agendas, and its painful philosophical discussions make the OG movie sound like Socrates and Plato compared to this rubbish.Just look at the ridiculous outfits Emily Carmichael wears to premieres, and tell me this person should be writing the Jurassic Park franchise...If you're going to make another Jurassic Park film, get a writer who lives and breathes this franchise, who knows the book by heart and is bursting with creativity - not the hot writer agents tell you to work with.",Notr
216,"I loved every minute of this movie! It had a bit of a slow start to build the context, but then, it got packed with non stop action, chases and suspense.For me, the movie scored really high for the following points:
Revisited the old characters and showed us what they are doing now, plus we got some nice touching scenes (maybe a bit of cliché here and there, but nothing exaggerated)Main focus was still on the new characters (from the Jurassic World series) and got them to merge nicely with the old ones, share screen time and exchange jokesScared me and made me jump in my seat (happened at least 3 times)Provided me with more than a couple of crazy chases / dinosaur encounters that made me feel like I was part of the scenes, kept me in a nonstop tense mood while my brain is completely frozen by the spectacular camera shotsProbably the people that scored this film low, confused it with something else. It's a Jurassic World film, so go there to enjoy the cinematic experience, not with some unrealistic expectation of a complex story-telling and character development.Remember Michael Bay's Transformers movies? It's that much fun! It's got lots of dinosaurs (old and new ones), lots of fights/chases, lots of action, hell yeah! What more could you wish for? Best movie in the entire francize for me.",Notr
217,"You know what? The nostalgia sorta works here for me. It's endearing, to see the old cast again, some iconic scenes recreations, now with a sort of poke at the generational gap, I dig it. It brought me back a piece of my childhood and a movie ain't good unless it can connect you to something. I don't watch Jurassic Park for perfect plot lines or complexities, I do it for the majestic Dino recreation. This one just works.There are also some very uniquely terrifying situations and I've seen every which genre of thriller/horror so that was kinda nice. The actors were all playing their character really well and they all seems to genuinely like working with each other.Overall I liked everything.",Notr

All I can say is that I really do hope that this film franchise is now dead and extinct forever, because it was TERRIBLE!The characters, I didn't care about. Dodgson even less. It was nice to see the three original characters back together but the story and bad writing overshadowed all of this. The story was so long winded and boring that I nearly turned it off midway. I only finished it (and that was incredibly difficult) because I felt I owed it to Jurassic park to finish the final installment.Instantly forgettable, forever regrettable. You will be wasting your time watching this..it's all been done and been seen in the previous five movies.

227,"The first Jurassic Park was a thought-provoking science fiction film with enormous entertainment value.But after the first film, pseudoscientific realism was thrown in the trash can, emphasis was placed just on the popcorn factor, making these movies falling into the spectrum of a good visual festival with a mediocre narrative.This film is perhaps the one that takes this principle further. The story is generic, it serves as a pretext to go from action scene to action scene, with dinosaurs, explosions, bar fights, impossible pursuits with vehicles on land and in the air.However, it still has some well-crafted nostalgia factor. I really enjoyed seeing Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum together once again. And to the film's credit, these characters are more than glorified appearances, taking up quite a bit of space in the film.Conclusion: It's a brainless action movie with plenty of nostalgia, good character moments, and a corny b-plot narrative that is very bland and shallow.I enjoyed this movie more than the previous one. If you don't expect much from it, it might be fun.",Notr

That was cool, but somehow even with the original stars, the old magic could not be restored. The Francise has run its course, and the way they left it does not sit right with me. Dinosaurs have a right to live alongside us? That seems terrifying and not a happy way to leave things. I still give this movie a 7 due to exciting action scenes. I often found I was tensing in suspense from the action. And that is really what you come to expect from these movies; good dinosaur action.",Notr
230,"Dominion had a rough initial start. But it thankfully ramps up the fun the more the movie gets going. But seriously, lets never do that cringeworthy introduction video of a modern day news feed again, it genuinely felt like a parody or comedy but no-one in the theater was laughing. This type of start obviously gave me a hard time to get into the movie. The dialog is under-par, the characters are meh, and people are sitting around a too much for what is a world filled with dinosaurs. Also, realistically speaking, no current day government would ever allow these dinosaurs to just roam around. So you really do need to allow some fantasy, even though this show tries to be real (like that news feed segment).But then, the trip to Malta happens and imo this is where the movie kicks off and pretty much does. Not. Let. Go. It's almost action piece after action piece. First off the Malta scenes reminded me a ton of a watching a James Bond movie. The action directing is absolutely excellent here and really engaging. It genuinely caught me off guard how good it was and I was finally hooked into the movie. Then a bit later then reintroduce the original characters, now I already knew this before hand, so no surprises for me, but it was nice seeing them and they at least had something to do, except for Ian Malcolm who was a bit more absent. Regarding the original characters, there are a few but imo not excessive amount of call backs/nostalgia hooks. The only one I thought was a bit much was having Malcolm distract the dino with a torch again, oh well, you know what you are getting into. Also the Barbasol can had no place whatsoever in this movie, felt really random.There are enough dinosaurs here to satisfy your needs, at least mine were met well enough. If I'd had to guess we've had more encounters than any previous movie. And with the disappointment that was Fallen Kingdom and it's awful auction plot this was a return to form imo. The types of dinosaurs are also fantastic, loved that they tried to do some new stuff and also bring in some new development in how some dinosaurs might have looked (feathers). What is a running theme though is that the dinosaurs a lot of the times just ''appear'' out of thin air it seems, they might have a short announcement of a yell or something but they pop up everywhere. That does in turn make encounters less impactful.Directing overall was good, though the action directing being the standout. Acting was all good, didn't really expect anything surprising from these actors and their characters didn't require much range besides Bryce which did great.Characters, I only have a gripe with the main ''villain'' who they made a current day awkward billionaire CEO, he looked like he walked straight out of the Apple building. Imo, this didn't really work for me. He wasn't annoying enough to be funny, nor evil enough to be hated and feel the satisfaction when he is down on his luck. His decisions are weird, and overall it just felt like a character that wasn't real. The clone girl storyline was improved, it was basic but it needed to be done for her to have any meaning in the movie, though her scenes still felt like ''get it over with''.Music was pretty good, they brought back some of the Williams stuff but kept it subtle, which I think was a tasteful decision not to go overboard. But it shows that the JW trilogy lacks a good score. The music for action scenes once again was good too, and they opted for some action scenes to not use any music which I can appreciate, it just adds that bit more intensity when the music is gone.The movie ends again sadly with a bit of that cringe worthy writing that it started with, so...wish they didn't do that. Character storylines are wrapped up vaguely, guess they keep them open for whatever comes next.All in all I had more fun here than I expected.",Notr

237,"Continuing the Jurassic Park franchise tradition of every subsequent sequel being weaker than the previous one, Jurassic World Dominion is as embarrassing & incompetent as any blockbuster can get. An insipid, moronic & lacklustre entry with nonsensical plot, soulless characters & dull action, this sixth & final instalment is possibly the weakest of all entries in the series and is one of the worst films of the year so far.Directed by Colin Trevorrow (Jurassic World), the film picks what Fallen Kingdom had setup with its ending and discards it for a much safer, less ambitious & far more idiotic premise. And then it fails at executing that properly too. The new characters are cringe, reprising ones remain just as uninteresting as they were before and they also make the original trio return to pander fans, pick an easy paycheck & add nothing to the saga.The film suffers from not having a clearly defined set of priorities. It wants to be too many things yet ends up being nothing but a waste of time & money. For a plot set in a world now run over by dinosaurs, the possibilities were endless yet it spends too much time on characters investigating a conspiracy and narrates it with such ineptitude that we are never invested in it. And if that isn't enough, the editing on display is an absolute horror show.Overall, Jurassic Park Dominion doesn't have an ounce of magic, wonder or sense of adventure that the series once basked in and is a bland, generic, emotionally vacant & creatively bankrupt conclusion to a franchise that should've remained a duology at best. Blockbuster filmmaking at its most hollow, this film not only makes the same mistakes as before but also several new ones and despite few crowd-pleasing dino set pieces, it remains a forgettable ride.",Notr

All of the stars in the movie can't do anything, can't save it. There is lack of logic in every event that happens in the movie.Like, one in the beginning, the girl gets scared of the raptor outside the house, literally 2 minutes after she grabs her bike and goes to ride.Also world where dinosaurs and human are roaming the earth is too calm.

Since this was presumed to mark the denouement of this decade-long franchise, this was rather an obvious decision from their end to bank upon the element of nostalgia for one last time.Not that I'm complaining though; as a fan of Jurassic Park and these wondrous critters in general, I couldn't have asked for more to be honest. Yet, my biggest complaint is that amid all this flashiness and showboating, the makers for whatever reason forgot to look after the core storyline.

The special effects are bigger than ever, the casting is fairly solid, the audience only expects a mindless popcorn movie anyway. What could go wrong? How about a screenplay so convoluted, loud, and boring that the whole thing falls apart?Jurassic World: Dominion (JWD) is yet another example of how Hollywood is handing multibillion-dollar franchises to inept, unqualified screenwriters. Like so many other high-profile, big-budget theatrical releases and streaming series from about 2017-2022, the screenwriters don't seem to understand how real people interact with each other or form sentences. JWD is a collection of digital set pieces in which human actors spout one-liners while jumping away from CG monsters. Dialogue is on the nose and frequently describes what we already see onscreen. Stock villains from sci-fi, westerns, 80s action flicks, and spy capers abound. None of it matches up coherently.This nonsense can be fun when an overall story doesn't take itself too seriously (I actually enjoyed the incredibly goofy take on Kong-versus-Godzilla in 2021); but JWD takes on heavy-hitting subjects such as global warming, the worldwide food chain, a child's life, an important baby dinosaur, black-market weapons dealers, and -wait, did I lose you?Everything is loud! And important! Right now! Immediately! And just like a loud storm can eventually lull you to sleep, about 45 minutes into the movie, you won't care what happens; and you'll realize there's still 1-1/2 hours to slog through to the end.I gave it two stars for a handful of animatronic/puppet dinosaurs (always nice to see a real prop when the other dinosaurs look like cartoons), plus a clever throwaway gag involving the original cast and a loud espresso machine.",Notr

Dr. Henry Wu who throughout the first 5 films consistently states his meticulous DNA innovations is the ""foundation of all things jurassic,"" is now a hapless regretful hippie, and supposedly did nothing, all dino research is credited to the long deceased, Lockwood daughter, who cloned herself while curing an incurable disease in her clone, yet failed to cure herself despite having identical genes.Fallen Kingdom is ridiculous because the clone daughter released all vicious flesh eating dinosaurs into the world after personally escaping death multiple times. She frees all dinos into SF, right after escaping being eaten alive, yet displays no remorse for the certain countless gruesome deaths she inflicts onto N California area, in both ppl & non ppl.

It finished off the franchise much as the Rise of Skywalker did to Star Wars, but does not leave you wanting more.As a final comment, I saw Jurassic Park in Reykjavik with Icelandic subtitles in 1993, and this is the only other one I've seen in a cinema.

I'm sure if I spent hours afterwards analyzing the plot and the character arcs I would feel the same way, but I don't do that with movies starring Chris Pratt. If you like dinosaurs or any of the Jurassic Parks/Worlds, see this. There are a few throwback jokes to the original which make it all worth it for the old crowd and my five-year-old was at the edge of his seat the whole time - probably because he had to pee, but more likely because of the Giganotosaurus and Quetzalcoatlus. See the movie. Enjoy yourself. And for 2 1/2 hours try not to think about the chaos that we are actually living in.",Notr
267,"If you were asked to guess the plot of this movie by watching the last 5 minutes off Fallen Kingdom, you would stand no chance.I thought we would spend the film with dinosaurs running riot on earth. Ruining towns, attempts at domesticating, things like that. But no. Instead we get like a spy movie?Is it nice to see the old characters? Sure but because there are two groups on two completely separate ""missions"", it can feel lob sided and underdeveloped. Crisp Rat and BDH literally spend the whole movie journeying to their destination. That is there plot. ""Take plane....arrive at climax"". They may as well have not been there.Also the CGI just looked bad. It looks like cartoons. Like Dinosaur King. Just look at the first Jurassic Park movie, the dinosaurs look so good, they feel real, but I never felt like we're are real here.",Notr

Wrap it up, full circle, deep commentary on the scientific power we wield as humans with both miraculous and disastrous consequences. This is not a crowd-pleasing, no need to think, monster-action movie. Which is something Michael Crichton's original novel was never meant to be. At long last, the second franchise finally got back to the roots of what the books were really about. And I loved every second of it.",Notr

No doubt there were countless talented creatives involved in this mega-production, its just unfortunate none of them were at the very top.",Notr

A different premise, which sort of makes sense. Some heart stopping action sequences (with caveats). Certainly not boring.The negatives. Even more preposterous than it should be. Yes, it obviously IS preposterous, but some of the occurrences are laughable. Some of the action is painful. Claire doing Jason Bourne over the rooftops? Oh well, no high heels. Some great CGI, some not so much. Tbh the ORIGINAL cgi was more believable.Perhaps just too much, all in all. 7 May be generous, but the excitement just about makes it worthwhile. The original Spielberg is still by far the best, by a big margin.",Notr

281,"A lot of apologists for the previous Jurassic World movie, assured people that it was just a ""bridge"" movie. ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" may have been a bad movie, but it was doing the leg work so that we'd finally get the movie where dinosaurs are loose and running amuck around the world. That is what the series had been teasing since ""Lost World"". That is what all the advertising for this movie promised. Those promos that Colin Trevorrow directed where dinosaurs were attacking at campgrounds and weddings. Finally, dinosaurs loose in the cities, not just confined to an island or reserve. So, what does this movie do? Start with most of the dinosaurs captured and put onto islands and reserves. The main villains of this movie aren't dinosaurs, they're locus. Why do you do this movie? Why do you lie to us?The movie follows Owen and Claire from the previous movies. Tagging along with them this time is the clone girl from the end of the last one. The movie makes the bold choice to make this clone girl an obnoxious brat that the audience actively roots against.The three ""legacy characters"" played by Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern and Sam Neil feel like they are in a completely different movie. They are in a corporate espionage movie and Chris Pratt and them, are in a jungle survival movie. Despite what the marketing may imply the two groups don't spend much time together.This ""Jurassic World"" franchise has been a mess. Characters act completely different from movie to movie. The plots don't seem to have any coherent narrative through line. The dumb rules they make up for these dinosaurs change from movie to movie. But the dinosaurs look pretty cool.At this point the movies are passed the bad of being funny bad, they're just depressing bad.",Notr
282,"The Jurassic Park movies used to be about cracking boundaries, whether that was by scientifically bringing back dinosaurs, or showing us that we can enjoy a movie about monsters eating people whilst still feeling small and real and have that out of worldly feeling.

Her action looked forced and reminds me of a high school freshman in drama class. Sam Neil looks lost in all his scenes. Could have done without both of them in the movie.Jeff Goldblum was the opposite and made the best of a badly written movie. At least his parts were entertaining.The movie was disappointing for it could have /even so much more.",Notr
287,"The basic premise that dinosaurs are everywhere on the Earth opened up an entire world of possibilities for the script writers and unfortunately they fell back into some very basic Hollywood themes that are no longer interesting and in fact are more often than not insulting to the audience.The legacy characters were so good in comparison that it should have been obvious to everyone the final movie would have been a lot better with just them with a cameo by Chris Pratt.To try and explain the plot would take six different reviews because there were basically six plots that are very loosely connected and mostly don't resolve. I could go into them and discuss them but that would mean I was putting more effort in than the screenwriters did.Since it's Hollywood in the 2020s, you know the good guys and bad guys based on facial hair and skin tone. As Quentin Tarantino has commented many times, we have regressed to 1950s style serialized television.Run from this one like you are being chased by a velociraptor.",Notr
288,"I get that people are frustrated about revisiting old characters, but that's why I loved it. I grew up looking up to these amazing characters and having them be a part of what's new and to show how far the world (this fictional universe where Dinosaurs exist) has gone since the first park is fun to see.I loved that they had a new plot line that added back some different science fiction elements. They aren't terribly new plots, but they aren't necessarily the traditional Jurassic park plots. I am pretty sure they took inspiration from Christons other book Prey (this is a wild leap because I haven't read the book just heard the synopsis).They had action, they had humor, they had moral dilemma, they had philosophy, they had romance, they had familial love, they had science fiction and most importantly, they had loads and loads of dinosaurs. They even had updated ones using the most recent knowledge from paleontology.I get it was a lot of ""fanporn"" so some people are upset, but that's why I am giving it a good review. I LOVED it and it wasn't so overwhelming that it made the story horrible (like Force Awakens).I hope it gets some more good reviews!",Notr
289,"I've seen a myriad of terrible movies in my day but none have ever made me so mad that I actually felt the urge to create an IMDb profile to write a review, this is that movie. It wouldn't necessarily be that devastatingly awful if it wasn't carrying the legacy of one of the most cherished cinematic franchises in history, but it is. It completely abandons the theme and mood of the original trilogy, far worse than it's two predecessors. It just simply follows the same 60% to 40% action-comedy split that every major box office hit now has to follow. It's all written for the exact same audience and at this point I'd honestly rather have something genuinely awful than generic as long as it was original. That being said, I am just talking about the dialogue for the most part. The plot definitely exceeds expectations of failure and laziness, but honestly after the 146 minute run time I truly lack the energy to express my feelings towards it fully. The only thing this movie really succeeded in was changing how I feel about reproductive rights. In the wake of this movie I have officially become a staunch supporter of the pro-life movement, I never want to have to see an abortion like this again.",Notr

Part 2 was a bit boring.I've read the reviews before we watched this film and think they don't do this movie any justice. Neither is the 6th Jurassic film boring nor is there a dinosaur attack every 3 minutes. People tend to exaggerate. Don't take them serious.Part 6 has Laura Dern, Ed Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and the two major actors from the previous films reunited and we also see Blue, the cute raptor. She now has a baby and the scenes with Blue and the baby are particularly touching.What I also enjoyed about this 6th part was for one thing the filming locations (Malta) and lots of new dinosaur types in close up scenes.Forget about all these lousy reviews, simply give it a chance and enjoy this truly entertaining movie!",Notr

But I've learnt a valuable lesson today - the audiences in this day and age are so hard to please, even if the original Jurassic park were to come out today people would probably give that negative reviews too.Don't believe what you read from the masses. I thought this film was excellent and was a great send off for the ""world"" trilogy. It gave me goosebumps, it made me feel wonder, sadness, surprise and fear. Sound familiar?? Another film does that too. It's called Jurassic Park.I'm by no means saying this film is as good as the original. But it is MILES better than Fallen Kingdom and I actually think this film merged the original cast with the recent very well. Both groups were integral to the plot and actually contributed. They used their nightmare experience from the first film and used it to survive.I could go on and write another 1000 words to this review challenging people who say ""there wasn't enough dinosaurs. Too much focus on people"" and to that I say - if that's what you want then go watch the walking with dinosaurs movie.. this isn't a Dino documentary. It's a science fiction film which involved HUMANS creating dinosaurs from DNA. People and their selfish motivations are kind of important to how the entire series has worked thus far.If you're reading this review and haven't seen the film because you've been put off by all the negativity - then please, go and see the film and judge for yourself. Don't be the negativesaurus that so many seem to be these days.And yes, I did just say Negativesaurus. I'm using it now.",Notr
295,"The original 'Jurassic Park' still holds up as a genre landmark (the quintessential dinosaur adventure) and is still a great film in its own way. It has been years since seeing the two 'Jurassic Park' sequels, but do remember not caring for them all that much at all (especially the third film). The first 'Jurassic World' was a lot of fun, though with flaws, and actually liked 'Fallen Kingdom' more than most while acknowledging that it had a lot of issues and that it wasn't great.'Jurassic World: Dominion' did sound interesting and was over the moon to see the original cast reuniting. Despite all of that, 'Jurassic World: Dominion' turned out to be a big disappointment and was something of an uncomfortable experience seeing it in the cinema. To me, it wasn't terrible and not as bad as has been said by some with some good things. But there are also a lot of faults that cannot be overlooked, even when taking the film for what it is and what it was aiming for.Beginning with the good, the scenery is absolutely beautiful and shot with a lot of slick style and atmosphere. There are some good action sequences here and some inventive stunt work, the whole Malta sequence is exhilarating and when the film finally shows some degree of energy. Also standing out in a good way is Claire's very tense horror film-like encounter with the dinosaur. The dinosaurs look absolutely great and show a lot of personality, the predatory ones being very creepy.Some of the performances are good, a wonderfully sarcastic Jeff Goldblum and DeWanda Wise stealing all their scenes. Also really enjoyed the chemistry between quietly charismatic Sam Neill and perky Laura Dern, that evoked a lot of nostalgia. The music score is suitably rousing.However, a lot is wrong here. The script is far too exposition heavy and tends to over-explain, shining only with Goldblum's sarcastic quips. Plus everything with ByoSen is incredibly heavy handed and says nothing illuminating or insightful about corruption. The film is much too long, half an hour could easily have been trimmed which would have been achieved if the story got going sooner and if the climax was shorter. It also drags quite badly, especially the very slight and dully paced first act and the climax does lack tension and felt dragged out, was actually feeling the minutes rather than being enthralled. The whole ByoSen subplot feels like a different film and a marginally more interesting but still heavy handed and convoluted one at that, a lot of the second half does not make sense and left more questions than answers. Wu's part could have been left out completely.Did feel overall that 'Jurassic World: Dominion' could have done with a lot more tension and suspense and quite frankly the later action sequences did leave me feel exhausted and felt too much visually and audibly. There is no heart, charm or soul here, neither are there any brains, which play completely second fiddle to the big and loud approach taken through. The other performances do not convince, Bryce Dallas Howard does her best but has too little to do while Chris Pratt's frequently out stretched do all the emoting. Isabella Ferman came over as annoying and BD Wong is too much in Dr George Huang mode which doesn't gel with the rest of the film. Worst of all is an incredibly bland and a long way from menacing Campbell Scott as the very underwritten and afterthought-like villain.In conclusion, could have been so much better. 5/10.",Notr

Same distorted narrative about negative vs positive characters that don't reflect any reality. The old characters are lifeless and it is easy to see they don't believe in the plot. I love Sam Neill acting but in this case it was pretty sad to digest his acting. The same has happened to many classics like Starwars. Matrix and others. They became unwatchable.Where are the Hollywood movies of the 20th century that were positive, optimistic, full of life, and fun to watch?

And ok, the story line is a little light. But if you can get past these 2 minor issues, you will really enjoy the movie. Laura Dern and the rest of the cast all look great, and Jeff Goldblum plays his best Jeff Goldblum since Thor: Ragnarok. Everyone clearly had alot of fun making this movie.The stars of the movie are of course, the Dinosaurs, and wow the artists and wizards behind the scenes really went all out this time. At a time where we are all used to VFX and where they can all seem kind of bland, Dominion really takes things to the next level. I don't quite understand what I am seeing, but the level of realism has been turned up to 1000. I wish I could describe it better.There are a few scenes which really stood out. A scene with Bryce Dallas Howard's ""Clair Dearing"" being chased though city streets and buildings by a Dinosaur, all seemingly shot with hand-held cameras, was especially well done.Anyway, ignore the haters and treat yourself.",Notr

Though it could have been a little better if they wrapped it up within two hours. It's just a little too long. And, though the story is a bit predictable, it's different from it's predecessors.

Only the product design team and the CGI crew showed their bests. The actors knew what they were getting into, and this shows. It's slow, full of cliches and self-repeats. Nobody is trying. The message the film solidifies in the end was already solidified in 5 previous movies.I don't want to dig deeper into this. There is no point. It bored me to death, and all the shots of the old cast with nostalgic music made me feel angry and manipulated. I can't rate this either.

The action, while maybe not the absolute best in the series, is still a blast and keeps things exciting. The performances are solid, with Isabella Sermon stepping up her game from the last film, and Jeff Goldblum adding a dose of humor. Plus, the nostalgia factor is pretty sweet, and the movie keeps a good pace to keep you entertained.However, the weak link here is the story. It's not terrible, but it doesn't quite live up to the potential set by the previous film. The villains are a letdown; they lack any real threat and are easily forgettable. The narrative can feel all over the place as it jumps around from one place to another.

We got a film about genetically modified locusts, cooperate espionage, CIA missions to save a annoying girl and a raptor apparently? You made a promise to a dinosaur? Oh yeah, and there's the hamd. Wanna see a 7 inch hand to calm every dinosaur in this entire FILM?! Well, here you go, it works on wild parasaurs, 20 feet tall carnivore dinosaurs, laser guided raptors, and on a mindless baby raptor and blue. The pacing is dogwater, screenplay/ dialogue is absolutely awful, and there is too many locusts to fill up the conspiracy theories. But I did like the Freddy Krueger dinosaur scene with Claire, best scene in the movie. Like the cowboy dinosaur scene, just ignore the stupid hand, it adds emotion. I love the old cast returning. Jeff Goldblum steals the show. Ramsay Cole is a ok Jeff Goldblum, Kayla Watts is a decent character, apart from being a LGBTQ. The swimming dinosaur in the frozen lake scene is good, just isn't Owen gonna freeze from it. I love Biosyn valley, I just hate the Biosyn building. I love the CGI in this film and the cinematography is good and real enough. The extended cut is a slightly better than the film, but still a bit disappointed by this Jurassic film.

How about the horror and anxiety you felt when the Velociraptors were stalking the children in the kitchen? There is nothing like that in this corporate, bland piece of uninspired trash they call a movie. Somehow they managed to make dinosaurs uninteresting and boring, while completely squandering the talent of Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill and Laura Dern. It really is a remarkable feat. The film feels like it was designed by an AI. It is a vacuous, empty, soulless experience that absolutely defecates all over the legacy of Jurassic Park and why people loved it in the first place.The writing is abysmal. Locusts and genetically modified children take center stage while the dinosaurs are reduced to flashy CGI showpieces that occasionally pop out to eat somebody or menacingly stalk the main characters before they are tamed by Chris Pratt's magic hands. The entire Malta scene was basically a Mission Impossible knockoff complete with some snazzy British villainess and a car chase. It felt so utterly out of place. Unfortunately once all the main characters get to Apple HQ... I mean Biosyn, the film gets even worse. The entire film feels weightless and empty. There are no stakes, the audience doesn't care about any of the two dimensional characters that are introduced and nothing feels earned. There is no sense of urgency or danger because the movie is too cowardly to kill anyone or put anyone in actual peril. Trevorrow then desperately tries to cram mindless nostalgia down your throat in an effort to mask his horrible film making and complete lack of originality.Some of the dinosaur scenes are cool, but this film just feels like a celebration of mediocrity. The original cast are reduced to parodies of themselves while all the interesting and thought provoking ideas from the first film are thrown out the window in exchange for some mindless plot about GMOs and giant insect swarms. Jurassic Park was good because it was intelligent. It was thought provoking. The dinosaurs were shown sparingly, and the scenes with the human characters were equally as important and interesting. In comparison, Dominion is stupid, bland and unoriginal, and makes Jurassic World look like a masterpiece. And what a waste. The Jurassic World Series had so much potential and it was utterly squandered.I can't even recommend this film as a 'turn off your brain and enjoy the special effects' kind of movie like Transformers or Fast and Furious. This movie is utterly uninteresting, and no amount of CGI dinosaurs can save it from being a total waste of your time and money. It is a Frankenstein Jurassic Park drained of all the magic, warmth and charm of the original. Skip it, and watch the dinosaur scenes on YouTube.",Notr
316,"What is with the reviews? Movie was quite good! Dinos were awesome and terrifying! Loved seeing all the main characters come together. Story was insane, but at least better than Fallen Kingdom. Served it's purpose to tie together all of the excellent Dino scenes.Reviews are not fair at all. Movie isn't not a 10, but it's an easy 8 for the excellent Dino scenes!Get Jurassic to the theatre, it's the only way to see this one!",Notr
317,"I didn't much like ""Fallen Kingdom"". I thought that it replayed the various facets of the series that we'd seen before, just in a remixed fashion. I did say that I though that the ending might tease a possibility of something a bit different for the next film. It did, a bit, and whilst I wouldn't say Dominion was a good film, I don't think it's as bad as the last one, or as the critics have generally suggested.With the technology of dino genes now in the hands of Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) and his company Biosyn, the world has come to an uneasy alliance with the escaped dinosaurs now forming part of everyday life. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is investigating a swarm of giant locusts, that are threatening the very ecostructure of the planet and believes that Biosyn are involved. She convinces Alan Grant (Sam Neill) to join her on a visit. Biosyn have never stopped looking for Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) and when one of their spies kidnaps her, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) undertake a rescue mission.I mean, just to reiterate, I didn't think that this was great - but I went in with expectations so low that when it turned out to be alright I was pleasantly surprised. The dinosaurs in unusual environment sections are interesting, particularly the scenes in Malta. Towards the end we settle back into more familiar environment, a ""lost world"" jungle setting and science labs. I thought the integration of the two-story strands was OK, and it was nice - if not particularly thrilling - to see the old cast and new interacting. The look of the film is good, with nice camera work and CGI creatures.There are aspects that I didn't like, particularly from the ending, without spoilers when the Dinosaurs of different species teamed up in the finale of ""Jurassic World"" I thought it was a bit stilly - and I still think that now. I felt it was a bit disappointing when, given the freedom of the whole world, to go to a laboratory near a remote jungle. It's another organisation that thinks they can control nature but whose shiny facility is quickly torn to bits when things go wrong. I also cannot make myself care about the clone human storyline, sorry.Again, I don't think it's bad - just a bit too much stuff that you've seen before.",Notr
318,"I am a huge fan of Jurassic Park, always been. The new World series was not great but it had it's moments with a descent plot and dinosaurs being in the centre. I was looking forward to Dominion. Unfortunately, the third and final movie does not deliver and probably is the worst of all. I am not going to go into details but it feels as if someone wanted to record a movie with dinosaurs but lost the essence behind it. The film has a lot of dinosaurs in it, multiple species, but the randomness, poor plot and lack of heart from the director make this a forgettable experience.",Notr
319,"If you love Jurassic park, and know everything about it and will notice all the Easter eggs, from certain parts in the script, even to camera angles, you'll like, not love, but like this film. You can tell they tried really hard to make reference to the original movie here, which I appreciated and I enjoyed picking out Easter egg after Easter egg. Are there certain parts that don't make sense, yes, but it's Jurassic World, does any of it really make sense? Who cares, just bury the logic and enjoy the ride and have fun with it.With some great callbacks and final resolutions for some story arcs, it's worth a watch for any Jurassic fan!",Notr
320,"""Jurassic World: Dominion"" is the third ""Jurassic World"" film and the sixth film in the ""Jurassic Park"" series. Directed and co-written by Colin Trevorrow (""Safety Not Guaranteed"", ""The Book of Henry""), it is a satisfactory conclusion to both the ""Park"" and ""World"" stories that should hold fans over until the inevitable future installments.Four years after the events of ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"", Isla Nublar has been destroyed by a volcano and dinosaurs have now escaped into the real world. As a result, the future of the planet is in doubt since these once extinct creatures are reclaiming the Earth, making life increasingly difficult for all the other human beings and animals who are forced to co-exist alongside them. In an effort to curb this problem, a secret experiment involving more genetic engineering is underway in a secluded location, which, if successful, will allow humanity to regain its place at the top of the food chain and keep these ancient beasts under control.Since the release of the first film back in 1993, the ""Jurassic Park/World"" series has had an interesting run among filmgoers. The original featured groundbreaking special effects, a great cast of memorable characters, and that iconic John Williams musical score to help cement it as one of the most iconic films of the 90s. On the other hand, all of the sequels have yielded less favourable results in terms of entertainment value, ranging from decent popcorn flicks to downright insulting to longtime fans. It seems the one that started it all has simply set the bar so high that everything else following it looks so poor in comparison. After almost three decades, the story that began so long ago finally draws to a close here in ""Jurassic World Dominion"", which ends things on a fairly acceptable note.I've never been one to take the ""Jurassic Park/World"" films too seriously considering their entire premise is pretty farfetched. I mean, how seriously can you really take the concept of bringing dinosaurs back to life using mosquito blood and frog DNA? But despite that, I still find them highly entertaining for what they are, and that is watching dinosaurs wreaking havoc and exposing the hubris of humanity. I still remember being wowed by the original film as a kid and rewatching it as an adult made me realise how well it holds up today. ""Jurassic World Dominion"", which is intended to be the final film in the franchise to focus around the initial story set up in 1993, features all of this and then some, so if that's what you're craving, the film delivers just that.For the most part, this film's effects look pretty good but still not as good as how they did back in the 1993 film. This is because that one used animatronics for whenever the filmmakers showed the dinosaurs up close and CGI only for when they were seen at a distance. However, since the first ""Jurassic World"" film back in 2015, the animatronics appear to have been completely discarded in favour of entirely CGI dinosaurs, which I have mixed feelings about. Sure, some of the computer-generated dinosaurs seem naturally integrated into a shot but others look so obviously added in during post-production that they stick out like a sore thumb. I understand that it's cheaper to use CGI nowadays but if these modern filmmakers truly wanted to leave an impression on viewers, then they should have at least used some animatronics wherever possible.One major problem I had with this film was its bloated second act. Without giving away spoilers, all I will say is that there are three different stories going on at once, each with a different emotional feeling. For example, one moment we might see characters being chased by dinosaurs through a busy city street and then immediately after we'll see a slow paced scene of expository dialogue that feels shoehorned in there for storytelling purposes. These parts would have worked out better if they each had some kind of overarching link to one another but instead these weird shifts in tone causes the film drag at the most inopportune times. This is where I started to lose interest in the human side of the story and wished everyone would just meet up with one another already just to get things over with.I do think the film made good use of the idea of humans and dinosaurs being made to co-exist with one another. Some people are shown trying to rescue the dinosaurs to take care of them while others trade them on the black market as exotic pets. There are also a number of brief but well-shot scenes of a group of triceratops and elephants walking side-by-side along the African Serengeti as well as some large pterosaurs patrolling the skies of New York City, with some even settling nests on the tops of skyscrapers. I guess I just like seeing such a jarring juxtaposition of the old and new inhabitants of the world being forced to live in the same eco-system, but at the same time being reminded that this is not the natural order of things. It's like what Dr. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) said at the end of ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" in that ""...these creatures require our absence to survive, not our help"".As a pair, both Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were fun dual protagonists as Owen and Claire, but they are rarely shown doing anything solo in this film. Though I liked that the two were a loving couple at first, I would have preferred if we could have seen them do things on their own to allow for their characters to develop individually, instead of being two inseparable halves throughout most of the film. Additionally, the young Isabella Sermon felt like she was going to waste as Maisie Lockwood, the pair's adoptive daughter. Maisie never felt like an actual fleshed-out character but rather a plot device used to advance the film forward until the climax. It's a shame because I saw potential in her back in the conclusion of ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"", but I suppose that was never meant to be.It was also nice to see the original trio of Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum return after almost 30 years as Dr. Alan Grant, Dr. Ellie Sattler, and Dr. Ian Malcolm, respectively. Though their reunion here is based entirely on nostalgia, their presence at least helped elevate the film above what could have been a forgettable conclusion to this long-running series. Again, like with the dinosaurs and humans, I liked the juxtaposition of the three characters from the ""Park"" films with the new ""World"" ones of Owen and Claire. There was something satisfying about watching the five of them work together to outsmart the dinosaurs with their different levels of general knowledge in their respective fields, whether it be Dr. Grant's palaeontology or Owen's ability to communicate with Velociraptors.Although it's clear by now the series has run its course, I will admit that for all intents and purposes, I've enjoyed watching all six of these ""Jurassic"" films for the popcorn entertainment they are. Through the good and bad, I have nonetheless loved seeing how the filmmakers made dinosaurs live again and had them roar their deafening roars. But if you ask me, the series needs to go on a lengthy hiatus before we ever see these cretaceous creatures on the big screen again. Though knowing what a cash cow the franchise has become (like a certain sci-fi series set in a galaxy far, far away), it's only a matter of time before Universal Studios decides to milk it even further with spin-offs, prequels, video games, etc. Until then, let's just appreciate what we've got for now.I rate it 6.5/10.",Notr

322,"I love the original movie, and I thought The Lost World was a great sequel. While Jurassic Park 3 certainly has its flaws, it still felt like a ""Jurassic Park"" movie to me. I grew up watching these movies.Let's go back to the year 2015, after 14 years of rumors of another JP movie with the most bizarre concepts (Google them, they're out there) being tossed around, they finally landed on Jurassic World. I couldn't believe they finally figured out a script and production had actually happened. The movie was done. Finally!Well, after waiting all those years I went to see Jurassic World opening night, I couldn't have been more excited to finally see it. Was it good? Eh. There some moments that were good, but the overuse of CGI watered it down. Training raptors to follow commands? What happened to the blood thirsty raptors from the first 2 movies? Now they take orders from humans?Then we have Fallen Kinngdom. I really enjoyed the tension of the opening scene. The flash of lightning that shows Rexy sneak up behind the guy trying to close the gates was chilling. I thought I was in for a treat. Goldblum is wasted in a 4 minute scene... It turned into some convoluted hybrid mess with a terrible subplot to set up for Dominion.Now, we finally get this supposed ""epic conclusion"" to the franchise that brings back Grant, Sattler and Malcom combined with our new ""heroes"" and it all sounds good on paper. What we have instead is a giant mess of way too many CGI dinosaur action sequences. I thought Owen riding along side the raptors in the first World movie was bad.... Jeez. There are no great or epic moments, hardly any tension., it's just a bunch of computer animated dinosaurs thrown together on screen just for the sake of it. Unfortunately these movies get worse with each entry, and this is no exception. While we do get a couple nods and homages to the original movie, it just felt forced. Nothing about this movie felt genuine. Even the actors from the original trilogy felt like they were just bored.... And how many times are we going to have raptors encounter people just to have them stop immediately cause they someone put their hand up in front of them.I don't know, go see the movie for yourself, but don't expect any of the magic or charisma that first trilogy brought to the table. What we have is another watered down, CGI fest with no real emotion or thought put behind it. It just felt really stale. Fell flat on its face.",Notr

This movie had absolutely nothing to do with dinosaurs, they were just kind of there while this script chased two different story lines trying desperately to merge them together at the end.

Everything is there at the moment that is needed and every bad guy, and gal, immediately tell the truth about their purposes at the first question as if we just wanna move quickly to the next scene without adding any depth.This movie has too many characters. They try to give a significant part to each one of them and of course in the end this falls short, as expected when you stretch a script so thin.Maybe they could have saved it if they spent more time in the jungle as we all hoped, but no.This better be the last Jurassic park, before they go the fast and furious way.5/10 and that's generous.",Notr

It's a fun popcorn movie.. and the effect look good (though not further improved from the last two).

And actually making Dodgson the antagonist was pretty cool as well.

I've enjoyed the other films, they look amazing, and they have thoroughly entertained, including this one.

The first half of the film felt like rushed. Even the old cast members could not make it any better.

The dinosaurs look just as real as anything else in the film. Great set design too.The big issue I had with this film is the overall lack of dinosaurs. In parts the film felt more like a Mission Impossible film or another generic action movie. Overall they reduced the dinosaurs to background characters.The acting isn't great, and Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's characters don't have the same chemistry as they did in previous films which is disappointing. The addition of new characters in the final film felt pointless when they had characters from the previous film who weren't used in this one, that could have taken the place of these new additions.There was no real conclusion and this film ended in a similar way to how the previous one did.

And to find 3 of them all together near the helicopter ??? In the obsession of surprising, in reality, you are bored. Everything already seen, reviewed and seen again !!! Do you want to surprise?

353,"I can understand those who don't like the film as it's one for those who have been with Jurassic park from the start.I watched them all as they came out and went to cinema and for me this movie was great from a nostalgic point of view.It was fab to see the original cast and learn how they had evolved over the year and come full circle.There are multiple storylines running along side each other, the old versus the new, and yet these storylines are all running towards joining the old and the new together.I watched the extended version and feel like as a fan and viewer I've been given the perfect ending to a storyline I grew up with.",Notr
354,This was the laziest way to end the Jurassic 'World' trilogy.. such sad and poor writing. Nothing wrong with the acting obviously; when someone can't act in big budget film .. it's noticeable. Just a lousy way to end the franchise.,Notr
355,"If you're truly bored and have 2h40m and want to poke fun, criticize, and be astonished how Hollywood can screw up a franchise, feel free. I would not pay money for it. I feel for those that did.I won't offer spoiler alerts. There's not much of a plot anyway. I will share, however, what I learned.If this evers come to life, we need to have and do some things. One, hold our hands up and palms out. Apparently this is effective and is understood by dinos. Two, have a taser and knife. These are apparently way more effective than guns. Dinos try to eat people in the movie, but they should not be harmed, right. Three, guns are bad, mm-kay? What a stupid, asinine place to put an agenda. It's a dino movie.Poorly done, Hollywood. I understand contractual obligations, but man, Pratt should apologize for this one, and the legacy stars deserve an apology.Burt Macklin would have done better especially without open hands, tasers, and knives.",Notr
356,"""We're racing toward the extinction of our species. We not only lack dominion over nature, we're subordinate to it."" Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum)Jurassic World Dominion may arguably be almost as good as the original. Anyway, it's quite entertaining summer adventure fare with the CGI dinosaurs more realistic than ever, including the biggest carnivore in the world, yes more fearsome than T Rex. The real dinosaurs are the returning veterans Laura Dern, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Neill, and the inimitable Jeff Goldblum. You just can't put them down even with the failure of at least two other theme parks.In order to fulfill the rigid requirements of the adventure genre, there must be a serious bad guy, and this Jurassic has Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott). He runs a sanctuary lab that houses homeless dinos but really serves as a platform for world dominion.You got it-the four heroes go through innumerable dino encounters to stop the maniac genius. But enough plot, of which there is nary a nuance, because the relationships of good people throughout are pleasantly emphasized so that we care about each one.We saw this Jurassic in a Phoenix Theater's Dolby Atmos, a splendid screening venue that titillates with sound moving your seat ever so slightly. When the dino stomps, our seats respond with a tingle. So, our Jurassic joy is watching and feeling the best motion pictures have to offer. Together with the most comfortable seats in town, it's a pleasant safari with monstrous animals, some over 60 million years old.The larger point writer/director Colin Trevorrow and writer Emily Carmichael make is about cooperation-be it among family and co-workers or dinos and humans, we have no choice but to work in harmony. Or otherwise, damnation it is or total annihilation. Having lived in the last three years with a microscopic monster, it's nice to see ones big as buildings with the hope that we will survive together, if only in the salutary world of Hollywood dreams.Jurassic World Dominion is a most pleasant way to enjoy a summer night out, even when it hints of extinction:""The doomsday clock might be out of time.""

358,"RATED 7/10
Language: EnglishCompared to previous version, this one is little disappointment. But still entertainment to watch. The initial scenes and the dominion was nicely shown, after that it travels to the templated evil scientist and his money minded inventions.If they concentrated more on dinosaurs then the science, it would be sure hit. The dinosaurs become Pet and less dangerous. We can use taser to control the dinosaurs. And some scenes the GFX is clearly visible.One time watchable, if you are expecting pure masala action movie with dinosaurs....",Notr
359,"So shoot me, but I liked it! It's apparently going against the general grain, seeing the many negative reviews here on IMDb, but to me it had everything to make watching this movie a rewarding and entertaining experience: apart from a few more talkative sequences the pace is mostly high, with many very exciting pursuits, the CGI of the dinosaurs is great (so I don't agree with the negative reports on that either), and the acting of all concerned is as adequate as could be expected.That doesn't mean that I didn't have some reservations too. Especially in the first half hour the number of different characters is too high, with a hard-to-follow and a bit chaotic story as a consequence. The music is at times so roaringly epic that it at some point became almost preposterous. I guess the oldies (Laura Dern, Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum) had a ball being together again, but it felt a bit too easy, as if the makers primarily brought them in as a guarantee to skyrocket the box office earnings. Of those three, the only one that did add something substantial to the movie was Goldblum, with his priceless ironic ad-libs. But on the other hand Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard both were great again, and I absolutely loved DeWanda Wise!In short, maybe not the best movie ever, but still a nice and entertaining watch!",Notr

361,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's been almost 30 years since Steve Spielberg captivated us, and John Hammond (the late Sir Richard Attenborough) ""spared no expense"" in stunning Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) with our first look at dinosaurs in JURASSIC PARK (1993). Best-selling author Michael Crichton's original characters and ideas have since spun off into THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (1997), JURASSIC PARK III (2001), JURASSIC WORLD (2015), and JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM (2018). We now have this latest franchise entry to cap off the second dinosaur trilogy, and it finds director Colin Trevorrow back at the helm. He also wrote the story and screenplay with Derek Connolly and Emily Carmichael.The big news here (other than the dinosaurs) is the 4-doctor reunion of Dr. Alan Grant (Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), and Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong). It's the first time all of these characters have reunited since the original, and those of us who hold a special place in our movie heart for the transformative 1993 film, are most appreciative of the nostalgic touch. However, the hopes for a magical finale to conclude the franchise are dashed in the film's opening segment ... a cringe-worthy ""news"" report designed to catch us up four years after the destruction of Isla Numbar, and set the stage for what's to come.You might assume that dinosaurs roaming our planet would be the headliner, but somehow locusts get the nod. Well, they are genetically modified locusts threatening the world's non-Biosyn food supply. See, Biosyn is the evil corporation run by twitchy CEO Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) that is attempting to control dinosaurs, the food supply, and even human cloning via DNA manipulation. It's that last part that brings Maisie Lockwood (an excellent Isabella Sermon) into the fold, and the DNA-mix also provides an easy punchline to Trevorrow's approach to this final film (blending DNA from the two trilogies). Maisie has been living deep in the Sierra Nevada forest with Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard). When poachers nab both the offspring of Owen's favorite raptor and his quasi-offspring Maisie, the hunt is on. The only question remaining is how are they going to finesse this so that the old crew (Grant and Ellie) collides with the new crew (Owen and Claire)?A stop in Malta to confront smuggler Santos (an impeccably dressed Dichen Lachman) results in the film's most frenetic action sequence. As Owen eludes trained killer-raptors while zipping his motorcycle across streets, alleys, and stairwells, Claire is sprinting (not in high heels) across rooftops like she's Jason Bourne or James Bond. While Owen and Claire deliver the heart-pounding action, Ellie has tracked down Grant on a dig in New Mexico, where he's ""educating"" a group of teenagers who remain glued to their mobile devices. Ellie convinces Grant to help in her mission to expose Biosyn, but we get the feeling he's making the trip for her, not to save humanity. With an assist from ice-cold pilot-for-hire Kayla Watts (DeWanda Wise), everyone ends in Italy's Dolomite Mountains at Biosyn's stunning headquarters. Slowly the connections become apparent, as it's Malcolm (Goldblum) who is the resident philosopher (all evil corps need one), and the one who has been feeding intel to Ellie.The rest of the movie exists so that all of these characters, along with Biosyn whistleblower Ramsay (Mamoudou Athie) can get in and out of trouble and dodge various stages of peril. The callbacks and nods to previous 'Jurassic' films are numerous. Some work and some don't. Malcolm's sardonic quips are mostly in tune, Grant's grumping and knowledge are spot on, and Ellie has remarkably little to do for someone who is responsible for one of the two main plot lines. Owen and Claire spend the bulk of their non-Malta time consistently recreating the facial expressions that have become all too familiar, though of course, Owen does get to hold out his palm in an attempt at controlling dinosaurs. There is a well-timed small dose of John Williams' iconic score from 1993, but it's the musical work of composer Michael Giacchino who mostly guides us along the way.Credit goes to director Trevorrow for the multiple location shoots around the globe, which helps minimize the set pieces ... most of which disappoint. Especially surprising was the weak CGI effort in the mines as some of the characters end up where they shouldn't be. DNA manipulation run amok is perhaps the underlying theme, but we have to ask why this is ... all we really desire are cool dinosaurs and a story that makes sense. Despite the film's best shot coming at the end - a Mosasaurus underwater - we do hope that, in regards to continuing the franchise, Hollywood doesn't find a way.Opens in theaters on June 10, 2022.",Notr
362,"I saw the reviews before going to see this movie, so I had low expectations, but I gotta say, this movie isn't that bad, in fact it's pretty good. It's a TON of fun, and the original characters add some life to this movie that felt missing from the other Jurassic World films. The plot is the only thing that kind of doesn't work, but even so it's not bad, it's just passable. The action scenes are amazing, and the adventurous globetrotting feel of this movie makes it stand out from the others. The dinosaurs, of course, are awesome, and there are some touching scenes with them here. In the end, it's kind of the dinosaurs themselves that are the emotional center of this film. Best Jurassic movie since The Lost World.",Notr
363,"Jurassic World: Dominion (2022) is a movie we watched as a family in theatres last night. The storyline follows a world that is trying to adjust to dinosaurs being a regular part of every day life. Meanwhile an evil organization looks to exploit circumstances by creating genetically engineered locusts to destroy the Earths food so you need to rely on them to survive...oh, and they want to steal Hammond's cloned niece. It will take the heroes from every movie of the Jurassic Park series to save the day.This movie is directed by Colin Trevorrow (Jurassic World) and stars Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy), Jeff Goldblum (The Fly), Sam Neill (Event Horizon), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Mamoudou Athie (Uncorked) and Laura Dern (Blue Velvet).This movie, unfortunately, it's about the same as Jurassic World: Kingdom. The dinosaurs and special effects are awesome. There's some tremendous species of dinosaurs and dinosaur battles, especially the last one. Unfortunately for the storyline, it reminded me of John Wick 3, just an excuse for dinosaur scenes like that John Wick was just an excuse for action scenes with a flimsy cliché storyline. There were also too many subplots going on in here - some were fun and entertaining (black market and underground trade was well done, locusts and cloned child not so much). The acting was fine but the cast could have been way better utilized with better writing.Overall this was a fun popcorn flick as long as you go in with the right mind set. Think of it like watching Fast and Furious, Transformers and John Wick; no it's not going to be a good movie, but the dinosaurs are cool. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Notr
364,"Please stop making Jurassic park films, the name is being dragged through the mud. The main ingredient missing in the movie is fear. The first Jurassic park movie held so much fear of these unknown large creatures that could kill us humans in a heartbeat, and there was also the awe factor of how amazing the dinosaurs were. Every character was at risk of dying in the movie and it was heart pounding to will them to live, and not all did.But Now, watching Jurassic World Dominion, I am faced with a movie that has no fear or awe in it. No one is going to die, and we all know it. No matter what situation, all the main characters are going to be safe without a doubt in our mind. The big grand dinosaurs are nothing compared to us smart and witty humans that have no issue surviving them... and on top of it they throw in these mission impossible fighting and running scenes that do not belong in this movie. And to push the viewer one step further the actors always look perfect. Oh did I just fall out of the sky in a plane crash? Well guess what, my makeup is perfect afterwords, not a scratch on me? I'm not shaken by that, why would I be? That is not realistic, it makes the movie feel cheap and phony. The visuals were awesome during the film, but everything else was terrible.",Notr
365,"First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I really liked it and I was so hyped about it, because I really enjoyed the previous two movies. Eventually, it wasn't as good as I had imagined and it's probably the worst movie of the trilogy. The plot of the 3rd movie was very interesting, mysterious and kinda different then the two previous movies of the franchise. The storyline was kinda well-written and some parts were well-explained, but it wasn't as good as the previous movies. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and really likeable. The filming locations of the movie was the real world, because now the dinosaurs coexist with the humans. Also, it was a very intense movie and full of dinosaur attack scenes, but not as action-filled as the previous ones. The dinosaur's design was as good as the previous movies, the CGI effects were very well edited and they were kinda terrifying. Moreover, the duration of the movie was too long and it was kinda slow paced. In my opinion, it wasn't a nice conclusion of the trilogy, because I expected something way better. The killcount of the movie wasn't bloody, at all and most kills were done off-screen, so nothing explicit was shown. Overall, ""Jurassic World Dominion"" was just an average sequel, kinda adventurous and I would probably recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, I really hope they're gonna make a 4th movie!",Notr
366,"I don't know what people were expecting with this movie and why many seem to be up in arms about it. I am a big fan of the first film and saw it in theaters as a child upon its release. For many, including myself, the magic of that first movie is never going to be topped and it's impossible to think it could be.That said, the second film has always been dull to me (and Jeff Goldblum seemed to be playing a different character than Ian Malcolm altogether). The third has solid moments but some silly ones as well. Jurassic World seemed to rejuvenate the franchise and was a good movie overall, but nothing mind-blowing in my opinion.Then we have Fallen Kingdom, which I believe is easily the worst in the series. Strange plot, terrible pacing, weird directorial choices left and right. The main characters and their motivations seemed completely different than what you would have expected from their portrayal in Jurassic World.That movie also ended with the concept of a world filled with dinosaurs - a point which people seem to be rolling their eyes about, now that Dominion has to address it.This is unfair. Dominion is a movie that must take the plot threads that are limply presented in Fallen Kingdom and then spin a sequel out of them. On top of that, it must weave in the cast of the beloved first film and make a satisfying conclusion out of both stories.And guess what? I think it accomplishes this, and much better than I expected it would. The movie is exciting, well-paced, well-acted, and has far fewer eyeroll moments than the critics would have you believe.At this point, I think you're either along for the ride or you aren't. If you're only casually aware of Jurassic Park and you go into this movie somewhat blind, it would probably seem like a mess of convoluted plot points. But if you're coming off of Fallen Kingdom, this feels like a breath of fresh air and a fun ride.I would honestly rank this movie as the second best Jurassic Park movie, behind the original. And Ian Malcolm's portrayal in this film is perfect, unlike what we got in Lost World. It's a joy to see.",Notr

372,"I have reached at a phase in my life where I have learnt to be unbiased in my judgement of films even if it features my favourite stars. But like everything other facet of life, this principle also has its exceptions - I cannot help but be biased about the Jurassic Park films and there are several factors contributing to that bias:
1. My love for films kick-started with ""Jurassic Park"" (the first film I had watched at a theatre, way back in 1994) and that film and most of its scenes have become iconic over the years - a feat unmatched by any monster film of the past and the present.2. Having watched the original in 1994, the child has ever since been fascinated by the jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring dinosaurs. They had occupied a world of fantasy for the kid who was by nature an introvert. From collecting dino toys to owning dino t-shirts, I have done it all and continue to do it now, when given a chance, as I am still preoccupied by these mighty beasts.3. The sequels and the spin-offs to the original have had hits and misses in them, never touching the iconic moments of the original but have always continued to be watchable even now. I didn't like ""Jurassic Park III"" but I have never overlooked it, having watched it multiple times as well. Despite the flaws, they define an integral part of my childhood and every new film is a stroll down the lanes of nostalgia for this 31-year old guy. They are special to me, no matter what.Jurassic World: Dominion takes place four years after the cataclysmic events of the previous film and the dinosaurs are out in the human world. They are colliding into one another and learning to live together as well. Metaphor for COVID-19? Yes, could be. The film also touches on issues like food scarcity and plagues and the side effects of bioengineering in agriculture. It is in some of these moments in the first half that the film suffers from pacing issues and from lack of being in a tight knot. But once the pre-interval scene comes up, the film changes track. The scene changes to the park and the essence of Jurassic Park is back. There are numerous dinosaurs, scene after scene, some new (like the Therizinosaurus, the Pyroraptor, the Atrociraptor, and the big daddy of them all - the Giganatosaurus) and some old (like the Velociraptors, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the venom-spitting Dilophosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, among many others) - a dream world for a dino lover like me. The cinematography is jaw-dropping and the mixture of special effects and animatronics seal the deal effectively well. Despite the flaws in the screenplay, the film is salvaged by the breathtaking second half. Among the actors, Bryce Dallas Howard gets the best character arc and newcomer DeWanda Wise turns in a commendable performance. But it was great fun to watch the OG cast - the dynamics between the trio of Alan, Ellie, and Ian can beat any newcomer, after all they are the heart of the franchise and it was worth having them to close the chapters on dinosaurs forever.",Notr
373,"Much better than anticipated with all the criticism. I wouldn't say it's too long; they crammed a lot into 2 and half hours, it only felt long for the first 50min because it wasn't until then that any actual action occurred. We do get to see plenty of dinosaurs in that time, though, a lot in fact, as they had accumulated across the world and been processed/handled appropriately by the government. This they did really well on writing and execution. The whole Maisie situation was eyeroll heavy but not as bad as Fallen Kingdom in my opinion. Some of my biggest gripes were dinosaur behavior (a herbivore killing deer and challenging apex predators), characters not using their guns during standoffs with raptors, and the inaccurate design of the Giga. But hey, all in good fun, right? The action was abundant, even if the characters were invincible, Grant and Sattler had a lot of screentime, Malcolm too, Pratt was great and my favorite, Claire, possibly had all of the best scenes. New raptor designs were immensely appreciated, I just wish they had been involved in more than a predictable chase scene. The amount of animatronics and practical effects were shocking, I give major props to that; the dimetrodon sequence was amazing! Sure, the flick has its flaws and hiccups, but what JW doesn't?

377,"LIKES:
The Comedy: The Jurassic Park series has always had some string of comedy sprinkled in the darker world of the survival pictures. Dominion goes a little more into this realm, working to make it very funny and sometimes in the modern style of more is better. Pratt and Goldblum are the primary haulers of the comedy, while the other characters sneak their own levels of laughs into the mix. Yet my favorite styles were some of the dinosaur moments and how the managed to make several of them have a little more human side and deliver that comedic punch to rock our worlds. Though forced a bit at times, the comedy really is decently done and feels back to being natural and well-placed like the first movies.Lots of Dinosaurs: It's a movie about dinosaurs and well you get dinosaurs... where others have shown their cards and given you a few species to enjoy and get glimpses of, Dominion really makes this supposed final act, have all the dinosaurs that you could want in this short run time. While some of them are the classic monsters you remember, there are other species from various eras that arise from the shadows and most of them feel just as sinister and destructive as you hope for in this series. So for those tired of the typical thunder lizards, you'll be in for a treat at the variety the movie brought with it.The Musical Score: Hands down another great lineage to this movie, the musical score is certainly one that still gives me goosebumps when I hear it boom over the speakers. Like the sound editing that brings the roars to life, the sixth part of the saga has the powerful orchestra work to add emotion to the scene and pull you into the full experience. Softer tones accompany or proceed the pounding orchestra blast that this series does super well. It's part of the movie theater experience worthy tone of this movie series and one of my favorite parts of the movie.The Pace: While certainly not the target pace of the first film, Dominion manages to still keep the action going and keep things moving. For all the story elements this movie juggled, it did not do a half-bad job for me in them working it to remain entertaining. From the opening moments that sum up the events before to getting into the Dinosaur action and solutions, it really just keeps a steady pace without dawdling too much on the truth. Again, the result is an entertaining adventure for fans of the series to enjoy and just get more Dinosaur carnage and rampaging on the screen.The Acting: While certainly not the most unique or Oscar worthy in terms of roles and performances, the movie's repertoire of actors and actresses accomplishes the fun I like to see in these movies. Pratt is Pratt, he's goofy, but action hero epic, as he does his best to tame the primitive and fearsome beasts that are on the screen. He's the typical hero role we've come to love in him, and he has some great moves to finish this series off. Howard is probably the one with the most dynamic range in this film, her character getting a lot more time and scenarios than other characters at this time. As a result, she accomplished much in her character's growth and ability, really selling the emotions for the most part and giving me more to like about Claire while avoiding going too far down the stoic warrior path. As for Dern, she's a master of her trade, and I liked the new Ellie that was still the same quality components we got in number one, but still adding some new qualities that shows what she has been doing for the last three decades. As for the rest of the group, they do a great job with the parts handed and there are too many to go through given how loaded the film is. However, the summary is: Neal is great if a bit underutilized, Sermon is funny and replays the role quite well, Wise is tough, funny, and reminiscent of the American pilot trope from Spielberg films, while Goldblum accomplishes much in that same steal the show moment you love.The Character Use: While nowhere near perfect, Dominion does a better job than I intended of keeping the cast involved in the entire film, at least the human cast. With all sorts of characters to try and pull into one final act, you have a lot of stories, actors, and teams to try and keep ingrained in the tale. Old cast may not be the most involved at times, but hit at the moments that matter and give the loyal fans everything they need to wrap up this portion of the Jurassic World series, including laughs and a few tropes that you might be wanting to see. As for the new ones this part of the series, they get a lot more of the time and again accomplish the goal of expanding the story, whilst still being fun avatars to live through in this world.The Chase Scene/Action At Times: The trailers showed an exciting scene of dinosaurs and bikes, and you know what... it accomplished it big time. I loved the race through the streets, a feeling of Mission Impossible meeting Dinos as they raced for survival in this CGI world. I absolutely loved this moment and felt it was the highlight of the action for this movie and the true climactic experience, if not a little cheesy at times. Other action scenes felt very part of the world, and there is a few big beast fights that you'll be wanting to see that really have some fun qualities to them, including one epic finish. As such, the action does accomplish its role for this series and should have the extreme fanatics stomping their feet in delight.The Graphics: By far, the ability of studios to make dinosaurs come to life is still something that, to quote Laura Dern, ""you never get used to!"". For me, I love seeing the beasts come to life, finding the balance between computer graphic use and animatronics to bring these ancient creatures back to life. With modern technology, the computer work has never looked better in textures and stationary shots, while the robots are still impressive, but a little more artificial at times, though still doing a fantastic job of making them pop off the screen.The Action At Times: Again, more beasts and humans, means a bit more of other qualities being scattered and the action is again one of those moments. Prior to the new trilogy, Jurassic Park's action was mostly about survival in the world of the largest carnivores. While some of that does exist, Dominion seems to have diluted most of it to the modern day action, leading to some great moments mentioned above, but also weaker elements you had hoped would be a bit more intense in the long run. The result is less intense action moments and feel like there are less stakes to be had.The Subplots: Characters have to have arcs and backgrounds to be engaging right? Well, Jurassic World: Dominion does have that, only with so many characters in the mix they are a little diluted and bland. Both old and new have things they can certainly pursue, but sadly don't do well with everybody on the screen. The new pilot who lives life dangerously, Malcolm's story over the last two decades of what's happened with him, even Ellie to an extent all feel very simplistic given what it could have been. It's not horrible, and checks the box for complete, but for those invested in the characters, don't expect the most thought out character plots for others.The Main Story: By far the weaker of the tales, was indeed the story of Jurassic World Dominion. Painting a very broad stroke and keeping all the characters in it, this movie is not quite the focused feature the others have been. While most merely just want a survival film filled with dinosaurs and more dinosaurs, others again want to be engaged with the film. Again, for me, this film diluted both and the great overarching story is a little more political story than actually engaging feature. The villain is simplified and boring, the solutions to the problems almost as dry and uncreative, as they simply work through things. Throw in the predictability, the lack of suspense, and the statistical probability of what is going to happen and the plot becomes less impressive in favor of the flash in a pan gimmick.The Lack of Suspense and Terror: By far, the lack of suspense and terror is what I was missing in this film. Jurassic World has lost so much of the thing that drew us into the first series, the intensity of surviving the next encounter and how they got out, racking us with terror as the fake monsters tried to tear their way to food. For me, that feeling has been gone since number three, replaced with an almost action/drama feel that while it has it's good parts, is still not the same edge it once had. I did not find myself talking to the screen encouraging them to go, go, go like I once did and that was a bit sad for me really. It was this lack of intensity that II think was the weakest component of the movie and the lack of intensity is the component that really made the movie drawl in my case.The VERDICT:The supposed last installment of the great dinosaur movie was entertaining and fun, with the effects being the main thing to experience in theater. It juggles the cast well, makes for a fun use of multiple dinosaur species, and breaks open the music and technology to craft the world. It handles the cast decently well and keeps that engaging pace you want in a movie like this, devoid of any complex plot of processing. However, even the simple adventure like that lacks the bite of the original series, putting almost too much in one film that it spreads the quality across the two-hours unevenly and in many ways less than the potential it had. The biggest disappointment with me was in fact the lack of terror and suspense, this component almost washed out entirely given the predictability of the tale. So, factoring that in my scores of the movie are:Action/Adventure/sci-fi: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0.",Notr

The silliest Fast&Furious mock-up doesn't compete with how absolutely attrocious this movie was. Even the dinosaurs special effects seemed to have taken a dive in quality?

380,I think it wrapped up closure for other plot lines in the series that fans wanted to see. It had similar scenes but those are to be expected in the franchise. It was nostalgic and cool to see how they merged the two casts into a unified plot line. Lots of action. Wish it had more dinosaurs. Some of it was predictable. But I love the franchise and support it. It was entertaining and I think everyone will have a different perspective of what they think would have made it better.

But this one was so full of cliches, predictable, and had such a weak plot that it lost me. The dialogs also were so bland and don't even get me started on the hand thingy. You know protagonists don't get hurt or die in movies like this, but it was so ridiculous the way they would survive that it makes the dinosaurs look dumb. Like, they have to do the breathing slow thingy, yelling at them, and do all kind of show offs but when it actually gets to the point of attacking the humans they are suddenly all saved at the last minute. Also everybody seems to be in the right place at the right time somehow. The movie's logic is very faulty too. Such a waste of budget and time. It was so bad that I created account in this site just to trash it.

383,"Jurassic park was from the beginning an adventure story, with likeable characters and an anti-corporate message - incoorporating dinosaurs. This movie fits the bill. Some plots were a little iffy, but overall you have a great cast, some callbacks and motivation for every character. Even new characters, that are not just bland. That is some achievement in and on itself. So basically everything that the star wars franchise aims to achieve, but fails.Action is great and almost nonstop, camera, editing, practical vs cgi. The only thing that i am missing are the spielbergian pauses which let the information sink in and make the anticipation of what is to come even greater.As far as franchises go, slightly below marvel, well above star wars.",Notr
384,"Even OG cast couldn't save the atrocious storyline. I guess the writer completely missed the mark on what we fans were expecting. The last movie Dinosaurs escaped to mainland and now humans and dinosaurs will need to coexist. It's like the writers didn't even see what happened in Jurassic Park part 2 lost world where T-Rex caused havoc when loose on mainland. This movie should've been more of an apocalyptic feel, humans trying to survive, Government/Armies failing, safe zones being breached and overall carnage where the OG cast somehow ends up reuniting to come up with a plan to save human species.Instead we get the same crap as the last 2 movies, a fancy secure building that gets breached, a rich greedy CEO, and everything just falling apart as usual. No purpose for OG cast to be there. Super lazy writing and screenplay. No originality feeling. Felt like a hotpodge cash grab mess.On positive side, visuals were stunning.",Notr

Bright yellow. Luscious
kernels. Best enjoyed immediately, she could have waited a few minutes! ...and then when they return home later, I was looking for the corn. What happened to it?

388,"Jurassic World: Dominion opened in theaters this weekend. It is the highly anticipated sixth installment in the Jurassic Park franchise. In Dominion, we find out whether the dinosaurs, who were released into the world at the end of Fallen Kingdom, have been integrated into the greater society and what effect their presence has on the broader ecosystem. It's been almost 30 years since we were first introduced to dinosaurs in modern times; but, six films later, are we still in awe of the scientific feats of DNA splicing and cloning? Here's whether going back to Jurassic World is worth all of that anticipation.Jurassic World: Dominion brings back Owen Grady (Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Howard), who are raising the teenage clone, Maisie Lockwood (Sermon). They are protecting her from evil corporate interests who seek to capture and study her for their own nefarious reasons. Also, Elli Sattler (Dern) and Alan Grant (Neill) are back to investigate a potential ecological disaster brought on by genetically modified locusts rabidly devouring the world's crops. Then, there is Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) and Ramsay Cole (Athie) as fixtures of the corporation, Biosyn, which is at the center of all of these machinations. There's also a dynamic pilot, Kayla Watts (Wise), and a manipulative CEO of Biosyn, Lewis Dodgson (Scott). Oh man, did I forget anything? Um... prehistoric ravenous hijinks ensue.Okay, as you can see, there is a lot going on in Jurassic World: Dominion. It's not necessarily complicated, but it is a lot to follow. These Jurassic Park movies always have a bit of an issue getting bogged down explaining the science of this all. In Dominion, they have to talk about genetic splicing and cloning and ecology, and it just goes on and on. Sattler and Grant are focused on stealing the DNA of these destructive locusts to prove that Biosyn is evil. Owen and Claire are focused on protecting Maisie from Biosyn. In a sense, it feels like so much is going on that there is not enough time for the characters to run and scream from the dinosaurs. That's the unfortunate part if you really like that aspect from the original.Despite these reservations of the plot, the movie does have its exciting parts. There are dinosaur chases through the streets, through the jungle and through the Biosyn facilities. DeWanda Wise plays a tough-as-nails, wisecracking pilot, who seems to be the most competent of all of our characters. She gets good one-liners and has a magnetic personality. Her presence adds a lot of energy to what could become stale. I'll also note that the legacy characters of Sattler, Grant and Malcolm give exactly what you want. It's like no time has passed at all. The nostalgia is very high and they effectively scratch that Jurassic Park itch.Ultimately, Jurassic World: Dominion is an enjoyable, escapist summer blockbuster. The problem here is that there is too much going on and it doesn't exactly all come together. There are probably too many characters that distract from the main attraction - the dinosaurs. Nevertheless, there are good dinosaur chases and exciting moments with a great new character played by DeWanda Wise. While I wouldn't call Jurassic World: Dominion essential, it certainly is good enough for a matinee viewing, so get your bowl of popcorn.",Notr
389,"Most of this film is how can we hurt the dinosaurs or have them hurt each other. No character has growth, no positive development through the story. Last movie was kill all the dinosaurs in a volcano eruption and watch them die and this time, lets put them all in a sanctuary and then burn it down! Why the constant need to kill all the dinos? This crew should really be able to do better by this point. Very unimpressed.",Notr
390,"What a horrible movie. How much did they spend? All the main charactors did a lousy job in acting. After about 20 minutes I saw four actors looking into the camera (they are supposed to avert or close their eyes). Many of the secondary actors did a nice job, but it is obvious their scripts were poorly written. The best actors in this movie are all the dinasaurs. They did a great job. I am so proud of them.Can I just say stupid, predictable, self-centered kid as usual. One minute on screen and she's complaining, yelling, doesn't care about anyone, etc. Doesn't any of the Hollywood script writers have nice, polite, courteous kids??Is this movie worth watching for all you adults with kids out there. NO. The dinasaur action is great. After that, it is dumb, a poor example for what you want your kid to be, at every corner, it is so predictable AND unrealistic in almost all the action sceens. There is absolutey nothing new in this movie, nothing unexpected (one example; plain crashes into solid ice, buried in the ice, totally destroyed, the two actors jump out unharmed, not a scratch, all makeup intact.

Its day and night.This is just another cheap (maybe not the budget, but how it looks) generic, way to action-packed, child friendly movie like Hollywood is spamming out now'a'days.I wish movie makers had the balls to take chances like they did back in the day when Hollywood was good.Now they rely too much on CGI because its safe. But it makes the movies not have a realistic feeling to it.I'd say I will give it a 3 star max, and thats solely because of the actors makes it watchable.Without them, it would be a 1 star.",Notr

400,Huge fan of Jurassic Park. Loved the story line and how they were successfully able to connect the past and new characters so well. It was brilliant how they were able to bring back little bits from all the previous movies while adding a new dimension to this one. Such a great film and so worth seeing in theater. It goes to show how great the films have been and how great the fans have been when all the characters are willing to come back for a finale showdown.,Notr

What definitely worked for this movie was bringing back characters from the original films. I enjoyed seeing Neil and Dern along side Dallas and Pratt as well as the newcomers, Wise and Athie. However, a lot didn't work, like the storyline. It's generic and I expected much more. The dinosaurs are almost an after thought in this storyline, placed second to gigantic locusts (yes, silly, I know). Not horrible, but wasted opportunity. I would have preferred the movie expanding on humans living with dinosaurs in a modern world and exploring the moral and ethical debates that go along with it. It briefly touched on that but didn't dive in before creating some bogus plot about a corporation out to disrupt the food chain. Could have had some thought provoking yet terrifying and majestic scenes instead of the over utilized ""evil corporation tries to take over the world"" plot.",Notr
402,"In 1993 Steven Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park' was an awe-inspiring spectacle like relatively few pictures can claim. For however well made subsequent films were made, in retrospect it's not wrong to say that the franchise kind of feels like B-movies writ large, like what SyFy original movies might look like if they had the largest of budgets and best of all resources. When the first trailer dropped for 'Jurassic World Dominion,' whatever else might end up being true of the picture, at least in concept it struck me as the dinosaur movie we've been waiting thirty years to see. To have read more about the production, and to have finally watched the finished product, this is even more true than I could have hoped. This isn't to say that JWD is perfect by any means, but of course it's incredibly well made, and acted, and for the most part very well written. It's smarter and more thoughtful than the average blockbuster, and if it falters along the way, it's not for lack of effort, but maybe just too much.What's most notable is how very different this picture feels compared to its predecessors - obviously part and parcel with the scenario. Substantial portions of the narrative would fit neatly into any big-budget thriller, with flavors of Action, Political, and Sci-Fi at varying points. In these facets and as well in quieter moments of exposition or reflection, major themes emerge which are painfully true and relevant to real life. 'Dominion' explores balance in the natural world; humanity's quarrelsome relationship with nature, and our attempts to coexist with it or bend it to our will; the abuse, destruction, and mismanagement of wildlife; science without ethics; idealism confronted with lack of control, leading to profound regret (something I can readily identify with); extreme, egregious corporate malfeasance and dodging of responsibility; man-made ecological calamity and impending extinction level events; and more. It's very noteworthy and very important that the plot also broaches the topic of GMOs - and not the nonsensically alarmist tripe about genetically modified food being bad for people and animals (news alart: all crops and livestock since the advent of agriculture has been genetically modified), but the real harm of GMOs, which is corporate monopolization of the food supply. These are all notions which have been touched upon in other stories, only in this instance, each and every one has been twisted together with dinosaurs.There's so very much that filmmaker Colin Trevorrow and co-writer Emily Carmichael have tried to let this feature say, be, and do. To their credit, for as towering and arguably bloated as the narrative is, it is cohesive, coherent, and complete; engaging, and satisfying. Every aspect of the screenplay is filled with gratifying intelligence, blending together the inflated genre romp sensibilities of the most highfalutin sci-fi adventure bombast with stark, gnawing themes; fantasy violence with realist human drama (or maybe one should say terrestrial drama); action sequences with garnishes of scientific fact, theory, and jargon; ham-handedness, sincere humor, thrills, and emotional investment with, yes, awe and wonder. Such grand ambition is, ultimately, also the chief weakness of the film. There's so very much that 'Dominion' wants to say, be, and do, and it may well have been to the benefit of the story, and the themes, to split this almost three-hour extravaganza into multiple pictures. The amalgamation as we see it is better than one could have hoped for, and done very well, yet there's unquestionably a sense that everything is jam-packed too tightly, disallowing every component part to receive the treatment it fully deserves. There's not one idea herein that itself couldn't have been expanded into a full-length film.Still, if that's the most significant criticism to lay at the feet of a hulking monstrosity like a sixth Jurassic Something movie, then I'd say it's doing pretty well for itself. Yes, there are instances when the scene writing or dialogue borrows from previous entries, 1993's progenitor especially. (In the spirit of generosity, one might say such moments are an homage.) There are also instances when the intended thrills become so over the top that SyFy might after all be the best point of reference, and the employment herein of Owen's trademark training gesture is 100% gauche. None of this is anything we wouldn't expect from the average blockbuster, however, so one can only take such matters with a grain of salt, or a stiff upper lip, or whatever other colloquialism one prefers. And meanwhile, in every other way, 'Dominion' is just as well made as one would assume of such a major motion picture event. The cast is great, bringing to tremendous life the parts they have with all the skill and sincerity they can muster. Whether animatronics or CGI, all the creatures look outstanding, and so do all the other effects, and the stunt work. The production design and art direction are downright exemplary. I admire Michael Giacchino's score, despite those places where it too blithely imps John Williams' pre-established themes. Lighting, direction, John Schwartzman's cinematography - all exquisite. This is the result of all the accumulated knowledge and experience of how to create a movie of this nature, on this level.At length, I do very much enjoy 'Jurassic World Dominion.' Whatever one's impetus for watching, I think it's well worth it, including simply the silly, baseline popcorn-chomping entertainment and satisfaction of the climax, and even the entirely all too easy resolution the ending represents. Its strengths and its faults are equally clear, I think, but by all means, on the balance this is a highly enjoyable sci-fi adventure flick. In fact, I'd love to say that I like it even more than I do, but the rational part of my brain tells me that the feature's favor of Most Blockbuster Fun over Best Storytelling Judiciousness decrees a measure of reservation. Even at that - though imperfect, I had a fantastic time watching. Second only to 'Jurassic Park,' this is almost certainly the best installment in the franchise. Even at its worst and most self-indulgent there's a lot to love here, and I'd have no qualms about recommending it to just about anyone, but especially those with an especial fondness for the '93 film. What else is there to say? If you have the chance to watch, 'Jurassic World Dominion' is worth three hours of your time.",Notr

All of the tension was forced and it was so predictable! To the point where I could count down from three to my wife to predict a larger dinosaur would pop out.

JW Fallen Kingdom ended in a high note and it settled the ground for a great third movie, instead of focusing on how the world deals with dinasaurs they focused in Teenage Mutant Bugs... for some reason??Still, it's a fun movie and it was great to see Sam Neill and Laura Dern once again, Sam Neill steals the show with his charming, grumpy performance as Dr. Alan Grant.",Notr

New, seemingly exciting, charismatic, but pretty much expected characters along with old, returning characters, who have acted as 'reminders' of the original concept of the movie. The story is still unfinished, could be continued with some new twist, what can be said about this - and the two previous - movies. The acting was average, neither horrible, nor astounding, as expected from a movie like this. Overall, it was exciting and fun to watch, but looking at it more closely, the movie didn't really have a point, it has a strong message though - the same message that appeared in every 'Jurassic Park' movie: do not interfere with nature's laws. The sensible outcome - according to this movie - is symbiosis and peaceful cohabitating. Humanity's greed and curiousity will never change, but it can be 'cured'. However, in order to achieve that, we need certain punches from life, or else we'll never learn from our mistakes - suggests the movie (series).",Notr

So this Jurrassic movie is still better then most titles of same genre in last 5 years.CONS:

All of those in a movie are distracting and not enjoyable.The only good things were Sam Neill at 74 looked AMAZING and I loved this black lady who was a pilot (yet she only had about 8-minutes of screen time).Also, I absolutely hate it when a movie preaches to me and then ends the movie with what they THINK is an original, profound statement that you've seen and heard a 1,000,000 times before which was - ""we can all get along and live in harmony no matter how different we are"".

I won't be relying on movie reviews to see future cinema movies.Thrillingly exciting with epic turns and twists at every turn. A final curtain call on the jurassic era of cinema films.

421,It is unrealistic too drawn out the plot is lousy and seems non existent. It just has scenes that are action packed yet unsatisfying. The timing makes it more absurd. The lines are so vapid. The stars featured do not distract me from how bad it is.The most original things are little noticable things that still do not make it worthwhile such as a flying motorcycle and people sneaking into a prohibited area. It is sickening. I am glad that I was treated to this garbage but disheartened that I had to sit through it. I recommend skipping it!,Notr

This fragile balance will reshape the future and determine, once and for all, whether human beings are to remain the apex predators on a planet they now share with history's most fearsome creatures.The movie is driven by action and visual effects, with little care given to things like character development or a well-written plot. The pace is fast, and the movie is exciting, but it's forgettable. The dialogue is often cheesy, and the acting is just okay with Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and Chris Pratt phoning it in. There are a few themes that pop up such as the dangers of messing with nature, but they are quickly abandoned in favour of more action.Jurassic World Dominion is a movie that is best enjoyed as a mindless popcorn flick.

426,"When I think of Jurassic Park film, I remember the cinematography
masterpiece of the first part that starts especially in the middle of the movie. Which was the accepted effect of a movie in the 2 previous years . (though not the impression that remains in imitation). In the Jurassic Park 1993, none of the dinosaurs change into form, but the behavior that the characters emit in front of it creates an image of them in the mind. Maybe that's why we hardly feel such a void. . The most powerful sequence of jurassic world 2022 is when one of the dinosaurs looks at the surface of the water,like the most powerful sequence of jurassic park 1993 when looks at the car. Here too, none of the dinosaurs transform into a form. The brilliance of Spielbergto definition the narrative covers the Plot's flaws in Jurassic Park. Of course, I think that after some time, Spielberg himself came to the conclusion to use the sense of humor, but this sense of humor or caricature or darkness or the softness aspect should be done in the form of dinosaurs. Not to make dinosaurs that look too natural and serious while deflecting a sense of humor in a different angle.The action senses related to the Clare are perfect ; the rest
are istereotype. 3/75/5.",Notr
427,"Technically spectacular, but bit disappointing . . .Visually, perhaps the best yet in the artform of bringing dinosaurs to life. No problem with the suspension of disbelief there, especially with the added details of feathers, and other such anatomically precise renderings.But the story and acting, well, more than a bit disappointing.It seems they were trying too hard to play up the nostalgia and humorous dialogue woven into this. As for generic family viewing, this really is more of a movie for kids, with the parents and adults getting their layers of content almost as more of an afterthought.The one character that really stood out was DeWanda Wise's ""Kayla"", the gritty, been around the block a few times pilot who loves her flying machinery, and takes life as it comes.The usual suspect crew from the previous films in the series gave the story continuity, but the ""magic"" just wasn't there. Not sure how to put this exactly, but it just seemed canned, forced, clicheic, to the point where you could tell what their next line was going to be long before they said it.Isabella Sermon did as good a job as can be expected being the young ""Maisie"", trying to discover the real truth about who she is, where did she come from and so on.The most unfortunate was Jeff Goldblum, who could have been given much better material to work with, but was cast in this very narrow caricature that he had to be confined to.The actual story itself was a bit odd, not so much about dinosaurs living in a human world, but about the evil BioSyn corporation and swarms of giant locusts wreaking havoc upon the civilized world. I get the implications suggested, but it was more than a bit preachy, depicting the popular ""woke"" notion of evil biotech saturated with corruption and ill intent. The ending was Pollyannaish to an extreme, but again, aimed at kids for the most part.This could have been so much more than what it turned out to be, but then again it could have also been worse.If there is a next one of these, maybe they'll get it closer to what it could become.",Notr
428,"""Jurassic Park Dominion"" (2022 release; 147 min.) is the 6th (and last?) movie in the Jurassic Park franchise, and concludes the Jurassic World trilogy. I typically start my movie reviews with a very brief description of how the movie opens plot-wise, and I'm going to skip that in this instance, as the plot of ""Jurassic Park Dominion"" strains credibility in every which way. So let me get to my main comments instead.""Jurassic Park Dominion"" is written and directed by Colin Trevorrow, who also did the honors on the first Jurassic World, and co-wrote the second one. I, and millions of viewers, primarily come to watch this in order to get really good action scenes, and at that level, the movie delivers, primarily in the second half. It's as if this brings all of the best action scenes of the previous Jurassic franchise into a single film. The casting, which combines the stars of the original movies with the stars of the Jurassic World movies, reminded me immediately of ""Star Trek Generations"" where they combine the original Star Trek stars with the Star Trek The Next Generation stars. But in the end, the REAL stars of Jurassic World Dominion are of course the dinosaurs, looking more real than ever before. There is no reason that this movie needs to last 2 1/2 hours. Cut out 20-30 minutes of meaningless ""plot"" and you'd still have the same blockbuster summer movie smash.""Jurassic Park Dominion"" opened 2 weekends ago to mega-size box office (although not quite as high as ""Top Gun Maverick""). The Tuesday early evening (discount) screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great (about 10 people), and that was quite alright with me. If you are a fan of the Jurassic franchise, you'll want to keep expectations in line, and then enjoy if for the action scenes. Nothing more, nothing less.",Notr
429,"Something or everything just seemed way off about this movie. The actors were not all there and their interactions with their environment and dinosaur counterparts were so uneven unnatural and inharmonious.The attempt at reunion of two generations of actors was too on the nose to have any impact. Most of the screen play was just a rehearsal of what has been seen before. There was also too many overly convenient set pieces to push forward an already absent plot. Too easy for the characters to get out of seemingly dangerous situations and all attempts at any tension fell flat. Also, no character development what so ever. Agreed, these are characters we are already familiar with but not a single character can have a progression, come on. The villain also is a joke as are the locusts and their pointless involvement in the story.It's not all bad because there's is outstanding visuals and some world building that was left unexplored.

432,"Jurassic World Review-Pros:
The nostalgia! I watched the original Jurassic Park the night before watching this movie and I'm so glad I did because there are a lot of nods to the original film! It was really fun seeing the original cast back again for the first time in 30 years!Visual and sound. The sound editing and mixing as well as the visual effects I thought were really great, I didn't see it in XD/IMAX but I wish I did because that's the way it was meant to be seen. Especially the sound.Strong family vibes & morals. I love the relationship that all the characters have with each other. I love the role they all take in being such good parents, friends, romantic partners, etc. There were parts that were very sweet and I appreciated it, even in a dinosaur movie they don't overlook how important it is to have these bonds with other people. When the original cast meets the new cast it's almost like watching different avengers meet each other for the first time, I loved that.Cons:Kinda confusing. There are parts that are kind of confusing and you definitely need subtitles for if you are used to watching subtitles at home. If you remember Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom there are some scenes where they talk about clones and people that are clones which honestly is annoying and I wish they would've just taken all that out because it makes the science and technology of this movie more complicated.Parts that are boring. The movie doesn't take off for a while as soon as they are all in the jungle and then they all meet each other is when the movie really gets going and gets good. But you have to get past some boring scenes.Some bad acting. The villain in this movie has horrible acting. I'm not sure what the actors name is but he is Peter Parker's dad on the Amazing Spider-Man. I thought he would be great since he's great in that movie but in this one he is really really bad. It's almost like he forgot all of his lines or something. Maybe should of recast.Too long. The movie is pretty long it's 2 1/2 hours. This is the longest Jurassic movie ever done and it could of been shortened, especially during the first half part of the film.All in all I would rate it a 7/10. Purely because the original characters are so great.",Notr

434,What an amazing end to the franchise. Exactly what you expect out of a big budget summer blockbuster. 100 percent popcorn popping entertainment. Not you're saying old Jurassic Park but at the same time paying homage to the original. Loved every minute of it.,Notr
435,"Ultimately a movie that tries to pay homage to the past movies and ends up being a reunion rather than a story. Lots of silly references to the earlier movies, crowbarred in, often leaving gaping plot holes. The movie also seems to try and cram in lots of additional species missed from the earlier films, presumably in a bid to please fans, but instead it interferes with the story or leads to poor action scenes (the final Dino fight for instance).Ultimately disjointed, it feels like half of the movie is on the cutting room floor. It surely would've worked better in 2 parts, with more story building. There are also just too many 'dumb' moments (characters teleporting to the same place, extras ignoring giant.theropods eating people right behind them, characters forgetting that guns kill dinos, I could go on).As a huge JP fan this is a sad ending to the reboot. Sadly all mindless action and reminiscing. If you turn your brain off, it's fun enough, but ultimately the worst film of them all by some margin.",Notr

Just show the hand and it will automatically solve all the problems.The whole movie wasn't about dinosaurs, it's all about the stupid hand of Chris Patt.The writer is confused about what to write for the movie!

It was disappointing that they focused more on the people more than they did the actual dinosaurs.

While I liked this one better than Fallen Kingdom and was able to enjoy it with the action scenes and nostalgia, a lot of the writing really downgraded it.",Notr
438,"I am not going to lie, I didn't hate this movie but I also didn't love this movie. The movie flipped and flopped between multiple locations and had a ton of action scenes and it felt overwhelming at times. The movie (at times) felt like it didn't follow a singular storyline and it made it hard to follow sometimes. I thought the actors did a great job, but the movie felt like it relied on a bunch of cgi dinosaur scenes to keep it going. The movie also brought in characters from the original movies and it relied on you kind of knowing who they are to really care about them. Thus it's a little hard to care about a quarter of the cast if you haven't seen the original movies. Don't get me wrong, I love all of these movies for different reasons and this movie is not excluded from that. The movie was really well made and I really enjoyed the combination of old and new characters. I was not expecting to see the original characters throughout pretty much the whole movie and I felt it was a little awkward to throw them into this already established story and character connections in this Jurassic world storyline. I think this would be a good bookend to this movie franchise. No matter, this movie was a pretty good movie.",Notr

442,"This short line uttered by Alan Grant presaged that epic alpha v alpha bust up between the Giganotosaurus and the Tyrannosaurus Rex. It came at the climax of this fantastic movie, bookending the Jurassic Park saga that started 30 years ago. What a phenomenal summer blockbuster bonanza this has been for people of my demographic! First, we were brought back to our need for speed, and now, within weeks, we were being brought back to the magic of our love for dinosaurs. Having Sam Neil, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum coming together for this (possible) one last outing was an excellent peach of a decision by the production team. This movie captured exactly the sense of wonder, thrill, excitement and adrenaline rush many of us experienced back in 1993, and it also gave today's audience what they wanted, ie, that big feast of dinosaurs from different historical timelines and geography coming together. It even managed to bring a nod to the original in a crucial scene at the end, where, just like in 1993, the greedy bad guy tried to escape with a container of dinosaur DNA, got stuck, tried to get away, but eventually was confronted and killed by a group of Dilophosaurus.

443,"If I wasn't such a huge fan of dinosaurs and held the original Jurassic Park (and 2+3, I know sue me) then this would've been given 6 stars. I enjoyed seeing the dinosaurs that was probably my favourite part of the movie, that and Alan Grant of course, that's when they were on screen anyway and not giant locus. It definitely lacked that feel of dinosaurs being everywhere overall as they decided to make it cricket focused instead for some reason and to have a big bad be the science corporations and not the dinosaurs running around which is what I would have preferred. The movie was also kind of messy with many plots going on all at once with some cheesy dialogue thrown in. I wanted to love this movie but they made a really uninteresting plot that still could've been better. The dinosaurs were great though I loved seeing all the unique species to this movie and even got some surprises in there too. I loved seeing the dinosaurs around the real world and co existing or at least trying to, I thought that made for a really unique couple of scenes. I definitely enjoyed the movie but if I wanted to watch it again I'd probably skip to the scenes with the dinosaurs I liked as the plot was all over the place. To be fair I only come to see dinosaurs in these movies and action scenes of sorts and I definitely got them but overall it was only brief moments in the entirety of the movie. I hope they do more and make a movie about the dinosaurs living among the humans more. I do have to say the cinematography with the dinosaurs was really beautiful on the screen and the music was great which I found out at the end to be the same person who did the Batman music.

It's so simple, just show us the dinosaurs, have the dinosaurs battle the humans, have the dinosaurs battle each other for a bit, have the humans overcome their differences and team up to save the day. Boom, blockbuster done.Instead this movie mostly separates the humans from the dinosaurs, gives us a bunch of disparate human-centric plot lines that never seem to meet up or gel with each other played by too many improperly introduced characters with bit parts. Throw in some no-depth characters like the bratty teen girl that doesn't listen to anyone and makes dumb decisions that get her kidnapped, villains that are evil just for the sake of being evil, and a 'rough and tumble' bush pilot that looks like she just spent 6 hours in the salon chair getting her hair and colored contact lenses just right.When we do see dinosaurs it's too often not the big and fearsome ones we want. Instead we get a lot of little baby robo-dinosaurs where I can practically see someone holding a remote off screen to move the head of a marble-eyed, unblinking dino-doll, and then to top it off we get...dino-locusts? Gee, how thrilling.I gave it a 3 for the sake of classy Sam Neil who was about the only person who didn't make me cringe, but versus what this should have been and pretty easily could have been, it's more like a minus three.

This movie also had THE MOST scenes with the live action puppet versions of the DINO's... and all together the most scenes with dinosaurs than any other previous movie.I see many reviews complaining about the ""lack of"" story about dinosaurs... that's completely not true in any fashion. They do have a few storylines consisting of several non important stories that bring ALL the characters together in the final act. But how much more could the story tellers teach us about these dinosaurs we've seen and studied since the original Jurassic Park in 1993??!!?? We know how they were made and how they've evolved the past 29 years.In closing... THIS MOVIE WAS VISUALLY STUNNING, SCARY, & BEAUTIFULLY PUT TOGETHER. The story was great for each and every character. A beautiful ending to an amazing franchise that has spanned over almost 30 years.I'm very excited where they will take this franchise next??!! I hope they continue with a new storyline and new characters in the next 5 years!If you're a fan of any Jurassic movie... you will definitely love this action filled, dinosaur packed finale!

Seeing the old and new cast and characters interact was just awesome, but the many plotpoints get overwhelming at times, and make it hard to follow along with the story. The dinosaurs don't really get the spotlight, as the movie has a Political Theme going on with life living with the Dinosaurs. The size and scope is the biggest we've ever gotten from a Jurassic Movie, spanning to different continents and locations, which makes for some fun scenes with Dinosaur Chases and Dinosaur. Overall, not what I had in mind to be the epic conclusion to the saga, but still enjoyable. So, as the tagline for this review I have to call it fun but really flawed.

It was very nostalgic, having our favourite characters from the first movie all in threat with the new characters. I didn't recognise the character of Maisie in this movie. As she grew up quite a bit from the last movie, the actual sequences were also well done and having some brief cameos from other characters from the other movies was really cruel and fun. Add some of the Dino action sequences, revealing intents, especially that one dive scene in depths underground train bank. Oh, my gosh, that was terrifying. And a big call back to the first one, but apart from the cool action scenes and the fact that we had our old cast back, this movie was a little bit like lustre when it came to the script, I found my mind wandering at times I don't think it is the best Jurassic Parker,/world.

I mean, seriously, this plotline is taken way too seriously. With this silly plotline, at least make it a comedic movie or something. I cringed every time I saw one of the characters in imminent danger of being attacked by a dinosaur simply raise their hand as if magically all dinosaurs will obey that gesture and not eat them.Dinosaurs that hunt and eat people are everywhere, and the film's ending message is that we'll just have to learn to co-exist. Seriously??? That's never going to work when every facet of life is disrupted by dinosaurs that can hunt you down at kill you at any moment without warning. Their impact on the global food chain would not bode well for the planet's well-being either. And the constant threat of flying pterodactyl's on the aviation industry?? Need I go on??...The only realistic ending to save the planet would be to exterminate each and every dinosaur. As Jeff Goldblum's character said in the first JP film, ""dinosaurs had their shot already"". But hey, killing all the dino's would make for a boring movie. So, insert old JP actors with the new ones for nostalgia, then turn off your brain and watch CGI dinosaurs happily co-exist with humans in the end.",Notr

454,"Seeing the original trio returning to the Jurassic franchise was an ineffable experience, but was that enough? JW: Dominion, the sixth film of the Jurassic franchise, takes the idea of co-existence to the next level, where dinosaurs roam freely in this world like any other animal species. Believe me, it's dumber than it sounds, but somehow, I managed to trick my mind to get along with the idea (like we had any other choice). Anyways, following the events of JW: Fallen Kingdom, dinosaurs are being illegally exported to different parts of the world and Maisie Lockwood now lives with Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). Also Blue have a baby now. Two different storylines lead our Jurassic World team to meet the Jurassic Park team in the third act of the film.It won't be wrong to say that there are as many reasons to dislike this film as we have to like it. Let's first talk about the likeable aspects of the film. The visuals of this film are unlike any other film in the franchise and the production value is much higher. Without any doubt, with the advancement of CGI and VFX technology, from a design perspective Dominion is far better than most of its predecessor films. There are lots of new dinosaurs we get to see throughout the film and for those who just want to see cool dinosaurs on the big screen, it's a treat. The cinematography is brilliant. As mentioned earlier it was a one-time kind of experience to watch the original cast back all together and also they have a proper role to play and contribute to the story with balanced screentime. Jeff Goldblum stands out with his skilful performance and humorous dialogues. The film expands Maisie's story and reveals more about her past. The opening sequence might end up being one of my favourite opening sequences of this franchise and the first 10-12 mins were very satisfying.All this looks great when we see them as individual set pieces but director Colin Trevorrow in establishing his vision forgot what we the audience wanted from him. The thrill, the tension and the horror. Dominion lacks all of these. Even Jurassic Park III is more thrilling compared to this film. The core idea of co-existence itself was flawed but nothing was more painful and disappointing than seeing dinosaurs being sidelined as they aren't much of a threat now. The trailer was too revealing. A few scenes seem extremely fake and the stakes were too low because we already know that nothing can happen to our protagonist. Campbell Scott as the main villain was not at all compelling and in an overly-crowded film, no one demanded his presence either. Trevorrow co-wrote this with Derek Connolly, but still, it seems heavily inspired by countless movies. Dominion feels more like a Tom Cruise spy film than a science-fiction adventure. Writing is not only unpleasant but depends heavily on coincidences.Dominion lacks the awesomeness of Spielberg's OG nail-biting horror adventure and the terror of Trevorrow's own Jurassic World. Jurassic Park (I, II and III) were all about dinosaurs and Dominion should have kept itself confined inside that predefined boundary. No matter how rich and lavish Dominion looks from the outside, from inside it's completely hollow. There is no doubt that fans of this franchise (including myself) won't be relying on any reviews and hence like all films of the franchise, this one too is going to be a massive success no matter what.

457,"I have to say that I liked it, I really enjoyed it. I watched in the cinema with my wife, we both did like it.Of course it has some flaws and some movie/logic mistakes. But it's a movie, I'm here to enjoy it and not search for every little tiny bit that I didn't like about it.For me it was a must-watch just because of the old cast coming back for it. Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern. (If you grew up with the first Jurassic Park movie and liked the old cast, it definitely is worth seeing it.)The plot has some holes and it isn't perfect, but I went there to see some dinosaurs and it serves some dinosaurs. Also it has some references to the old Jurassic Park movies with some scenes and some quotes to it. I liked it for what it was, the plot could have been a bit better and not so predictable, but what should you expect after already 5 Jurassic Park/Jurassic World movies. We got some new dinosaurs to see, the CGI is great, the sounds that they created for it were nice and unique. I'd have wanted a little bit more dinosaurs, more Spinosaurus and more raptors and less subplot, but I still enjoyed it.",Notr

The actors seem like they were paid to try and downplay their acting to give the movie a special sense of corn. I was 3 minutes in before I knew this movie was a fail. The best part of this movie is I now know who produced it so I can stay clear of any garbage he tries to come up with next. There is no adventure, no excitement and nothing exciting about this movie. My favorite part is going to be when this garbage heap ends so I can watch anything else other than this.",Notr
459,"It is far form being the best of the Jurassic movies for sure, but it is nowhere near as bad as I feared from reading some of the reviews. Yes, the storyline is not great and the first 25 minute or so were less than exciting. It did however, get better as it went on and it was great to see Drs. Grant, Sattler and Malcolm from the original three films and if one can put the plot weakness out of mind for a time, there are some genuinely thrilling and exciting moments in the movie. Above all, there are the dinosaurs, the real stars of the show - and don't they know it. We get to see new ones like Baryonyx, Allosaurus and Atrociraptor, as well as old favourites such as Brachiosaurus, Velociraptor and of course, T-Rex, without which no Jurassic movie would be complete. (Yes, T-Rex was from the Upper Cretaceous, as were most animals in these movies, but just go with it.) So, if you love dinosaurs, it's worth watching just to see them in action once more, especially T-Rex who never disappoints!",Notr
460,"And that is a story.They either have no plot or they have multiple plots that aren't going anywhere.They either have no character developement or they have characters with multiple personalities.I was this film and all the time I was thinking: what kind of a story are they trying to pull off here?I just gave up midway and I was trying to enjoy this film but man, did they make an effort of spoiling that.A villain so awkward to look at that I was actually hoping Ramsay would be the plot twist villain. But nope...
Locusts on fire that looks like a few dozen that escape sufdenly seeming to be in more of a hundreds causing a wildfire. And despite being a huge sanctuary they just happen to land where the heroes are. How inconvenient.Chris Pratt kept looking throughout this entire film like he wanted this film to be over with real soon, like yesterday.And the stars of the film, the dinosaurs. On occasions they looked stunning. Other times I was thinking I was watching the real life Flintstones or an episode of Dinosaurs. I thought Earl Sinclair would make an appaerance. It would've been funny tough.But some dinosaurs looked terrible. In the end shot where the Dilophosaurus are at the Hyperloop and their fan was open, one of them looked like it was a broken umbrella. Not to mention some atrocities at the dinosaur market.Thank God for Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill to save this movie with their acting. You can see they had a blast together and that is the only Deze In this is worth a 6. If it wasn't for them it was a weak 2.",Notr
461,"How can this movie be done so poorly? How can the special effects be so bad in 2022? Also, why do we have the same old tired lines and dialogue decades later? Why does a dinosaur take so long to eat someone? It's it has to look above the car, under the car, into the prey's eyes and then pose for a photoshoot. It all seemed so stupid. I mean at the beginning of the movie Chris Pratt makes a promise to a dinosaur! It's insulting to the audience. This movie was long and boring and I was actually hoping the dinosaurs get to eat some of these boring, tired characters. I could not care less about what happens to any of them. I still have 30 min left of the movie, but I felt compelled to write this review while still watching it.",Notr
462,"Dominion starts with a cute little news report explaining how dinosaurs have moved into the rest of the world. It shows dinosaurs all over, including in cities, and there's some fun shots like one of a jungle cat chasing a dog-sized dinosaur. It's actually what a lot of the trailer for the movie is pulled from, which is why I was expecting a neat movie about dinosaurs in the cities and countryside instead of what I got, which is another movie with dinosaurs mainly in a big Park type place. (It's a shame the people who made the movie didn't understand what the person who made the trailer did, that a dinosaurs-in-the-city movie would be a really cool thing.)After that enjoyable opening, nothing worth watching happens for about another 45 minutes. It's just tedious dreck, and I almost gave up on the movie all together. But at around the 50-minute mark, the movie actually starts getting fun. I would recommend skipping forward until you find the place where they're fighting dinosaurs in a skeezy club, which puts you right before a fun chase scene. From there on, the movie is actually pretty enjoyable.If you're worried that the movie won't make any sense if you skip the first third, don't worry about it because the movie really doesn't make much sense anyway. Just go to Wikipedia and read the first part of the plot summary if you want to orient yourself.Overall this movie is less terrible than the one before it. If they had simply turned the first third of it into like maybe 10 minutes, this might actually have been a movie that verged on being genuinely good.If you've watched all the other movies, I'd say go ahead and watch this one too. It's deeply flawed, but it has its moments, the cast is good, and the special effects are terrific.",Notr

Such a waste, and don't get me started on the number of times, a massive predator was able to take to creep up and take the cast by surprise, were they genetically modified to tip toe ?I'm annoyed with this movie I was looking forward to seeing it and basically after the first hour I became so apathetic I decided to spring clean my email accounts while the film dragged on to its end.",Notr
466,"Despite it's attempt at renewing the sequence of events that gets these Dino experts on the wrong side of the fence, plot has a strange aimlessness to it. Commercialisation of the Isla Nublar's live stock might have been a good card to play or at least a militarisation gone wrong would have succeeded as a spin-off. Also there's certainly a good amount of documenting the magnificent giants but some bits don't really add up a significant value to the succession. These end up carving craters in which the hype gets lost. All this clumsiness directs at the lack of originality to the story; a common singular nemesis this time even without known origins and ending up exactly the same way as indominus is more like a gut punch to the hopeful viewer. Dominion may age soon despite being the flashy new instalment but for all it's carefully arranged encounters of new kinds it's worth a watch.",Notr
467,"Ever since dinosaur whisperer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) first put out his hand to keep a vicious velociraptor at bay, the Jurassic Park/World franchise has been getting progressively worse. Pratt does a lot of the hand thing this time around, and it's as stupid as ever, but even if he kept his mitts firmly in his pockets, Dominion would still blow harder than that volcano in the last movie.This one has a plot that is so ridiculous that it feels like a parody at times: Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott), ruthless owner of genetics company Biosyn, has created prehistoric swarms of giant locusts designed to destroy all crops except for those grown from Biosyn seeds. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) discovers what is happening and convinces Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to help expose the plan; she, in turn, enlists the help of Alan Grant (Sam Neill). Yes, this one is so desperate it wheels in the three stars of the original Jurassic Park, who seem only too happy to cash a paycheck no matter how lousy the plot.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are also back, trying to find their adoptive daughter Maisie (Isabella Sermon), the dumb child who released dinosaurs to roam freely on Earth; she has been kidnapped by BioSyn, her special DNA required for further genetic experiments.I approached this film determined to not let a lack of logic prevent me from having fun, but that idea soon went the way of the dinosaurs: the film is so bad that no amount of giant lizard action could make it enjoyable. Stroppy kid Maisie is ultra-annoying, the giant locust plot is dumb, there's a really out-of-place action sequence involving laser-guided raptors, a feathered dinosaur flies underwater, and too much of the film is played for giggles. And then there's that scene where Owen puts his hand out to prevent a dinosaur from attacking, with both Maisie and Alan following suit: all three of them using the power of the hand was just too much for me.I pray that the franchise is now over, but I suspect that someone will dig it up in the future and bring it back to life.",Notr

But this is just an excuse to make money. There's no story, it's just like some execs have just said ""Hmmm. We could probably quite easily make a few hundred million without any effort... just throw some dinosaurs on screen, crappy special effects and don't worry about story"".The special effects at times are laughable. There's one in the opening sequence, where a dinosaur's is next to a train. Seriously looks like a Dr Who effect from 1985. Really, really bad.So my advise is watch Jurassic Park, even the first Jurassic world, don't bother with this.It's embarrassing.",Notr

That's right. You don't know whether to laugh or cry, but the Jurassic finale is
probably the saddest waste and demystification of dinosaurs imaginable.Not even the nostalgia bubbling OGs Neil, Dern and Goldblum could save this sinking ship of a movie, but they at least made it more bearable. Plot convenience and embarrassingly bad dialogue across the board. Chris Pratt delivers the most bored performance of his career. And worst of all, you can't even blame him.Praise is due to the visuals. The dinosaurs look great, the perfect balance of VFX and special effects. There is one action sequence that stands out. Other than that, Jurassic World: Dominion is a soulless conclusion to a trilogy that actually started solidly, but in retrospect we never needed.Respect to director Trevorrow, to be involved in wrecking 2 multi-billion dollar franchises within 3 years - that's a hard act to follow.P.

But there was so much pointless dinosaur violence that just stopped being suspenseful. And another trope of the big bad corporation that was so predictable the whole time. Throw in a black lady with attitude, and it just seems like the goal was less telling a story and more appealing to constituents. And people are right. 2.5 hours is way too long for this simple story when nothing of significance warranted it.I think the final problem form me was the now common story element: telling us our elected government officials can or will take care of a major problem such as corporate malfeasance.

The inclusion of those three elder actors simply took away screen time from the main focus characters. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard don't feel nearly as important to the core story as they did in the previous two films in the series.The film also feels rather watered down and tame.

The story go sometime a bit too far with a first act i felt a bit long and boring and the good thing come in the second act because i was a bit scare in the 30 first minutes - acting and editing are sometime very bad and cheesy but in somes moments , it shine specialy in the scene with Grant Malcom or Ellie from the first trilogy , you get nice nostalgia moments between them with amazing actions sequence and special effects. I can describe it like the action in Fast and furious. Its epic in some way but very unrealistic in some scenes still enjoyable most of the time if u forget this. Yes!! There is good moments, very good moments . CGI are good i think except for few scenes because let say , designs for new dinosaures are particuliar and make the blend between CGi and reality more difficult to hide. Its not a step up from the last two last films . Im still impress with the first film that still hold up even today. This film bring no real surprise on the story side and the pacing his very fast , i wish we had more time despite being the longest film in the franchise.I hope we get a extended cut to answers some elements and directions the story go because there is a lots of characters, new plots , new dinosaures and sometime it seem i miss the attachements or the emotions form previous entry or simplicity . At the end we can say this is a big mashup for fan service . Not to spoil! If u go see the movie for the utimate ending like i did , u wil be surprise actually that it open many doors to more questions or another films maybe.But if u want to see big action moments with dinos and there is a lots old and news .

480,"I recall my first watch thinking that it was frankly a massive waste of time. BUT. The second time around, i loved it!This time around I did watch all the others again in a marathon, so I definitely think that Dominion relies on the nostalgia factor and the trust that fans will remember small details from the franchise. It's very worthwhile once you're familiar with the rest. While I agree that it's not 100% perfection, I do think it's very wrong to go into it with sky high expectations - the sixth installment to any franchise is never going to be as groundbreaking as the first. I do think part of its bad reception is that it's formula doesn't give the same 'feel' as it's predecessors. Personally I think it's necessary for the growth of the story that it doesn't remain totally the same.I'm definitely disappointed to see so many negative reviews because fan perception affects chances of sequels. (And I love this franchise far too much to part with it just yet!!)Overall, I don't blame my past self for being so appalled by this movie the first watch. If you feel the same way, don't be afraid to give it the second chance it deserves! Maybe this time have a little marathon, enjoy the films as they're meant to be loved. It makes the world of a difference. Happy watching <3.",Notr

Maybe this time around they will do a reboot - stop laughing. Although I guess that pun is worth at least a chuckle.Now for those who have not seen a Jurassic Park/World movie ... I am not sure, you want to start with this movie right here to be honest. It does make sense to at least watch the first Park and World movies. Just so you understand why the linger on some shots - or why you should go wow or aw at certain moments.Of course the movie is filled with amazing visual moments. And while I credit this for not being the first movie with slight changes ... it isn't too different from it either. The trailer and the buzz did suggest that this time this would go worldwide. But apart from one action scene outside the Park/World - we again go back mostly to the enclosed space where most of the dinosaurs are being held.We do have the uber-villain once again. Those rich people who can't get enough ... money? But he says it isn't about money ... what is it about then? You better not start with questions is my advice. Whether it is about motive or about logic (characters being superheroes and not feeling pain - though you have that in other movies too) or the story ... just enjoy the madness.

It makes me miss the first Jurassic World movie, which I thought was the weakest, but he executed it already well there.Maybe its time constraint, or stuff, but I appreciate the effort by everyone involved.

487,"'Jurassic World Dominion' is far from perfect, if just about entertaining to watch... kinda.I'm not fully convinced by it but I do think there's enough in there that's worth watching. There are too many characters, even main characters with the original trio and the newer duo both involved equally. With that said, I do like 'em. It's pleasant to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are a good pairing.Still, I wouldn't say any one character stands out here. They all make their presence known, though I'm struggling to remember any great moments individually - that's due to the aforementioned surplus. The rest of the cast, fwiw, are all fine - Mamoudou Athie sticks out most in that regard.The run time is overlong, in my opinion. I personally could've done without 30 or so minutes and I wouldn't have felt it was missing anything. The story itself isn't all that fresh, as in I feel like I've seen this sorta thing before (I mean, Biosyn... how creative!), but the barrage of dinosaur-centric action probably just abouts tips it over into a positive rating for yours truly. Could easily be lower, though.I'd love for this to be the end of the Jurassic franchise (is there much more to tell?) but there ain't no way Amblin/Universal are leaving this IP to collect dust, let's be honest.",Notr

Another issue is the bad character, even though our bad character seems like a cold-blooded person, it was a little weak in my opinion and the ending was a cliché. I couldn't see any problems in the visual effects, but the dinosaur fight in the final scene didn't interest me and I couldn't get excited.

490,"""Now eventually you might have dinosaurs in your dinosaur movie now, right?""
Watched the Extended Cut which included scenes involving dinosaurs, all cut theatrically. Including T-Rex drive-in attack.A Jurassic movie about dinosaurs and it's painfully boring. People criticized Lucas for having a lot of walking and talking in the SW prequels, but the prequels are no where near as boring as this one Jurassic World film. If you watched the extended cut, you'll get a few more dinosaurs scenes. Not many, but it's something.""There have never been more dinosaurs, than there are in Dominion. Maximum amount"" -Bryce Dallas Howard.Was there anything good in this? They finally brought back the Dilophosaurus. That's it. Now, for everything else...Since 1993, I have seen every Jurassic film in theaters. However, because of how bad Fallen Kingdom was and how poorly received Dominion was, this marked this first Jurassic film I skipped seeing in the theater. I have no regrets about this decision. The Jurassic World trilogy goes the same route as the sequel trilogy. Started off decent, but was then followed up with two painfully bad sequels. Almost like there was no roadmap throughout the JW trilogy. However, I actually think they had one planned after the first JW film. If so, they should've hired better writers. Colin was probably one of the worst filmmakers in re-sparking Spielberg and Crichton's Jurassic series. Those who think Colin's Episode 9 ""Duel of The Fates"" would've been good or better than TROS, look no further than his JW trilogy for that answer.Another big issue with the film. I did not care about anything going on, or for the Jurassic World characters. Colin ran out of ideas and ended up recreating the T-Rex battle from the first JW as the finale, and it's completely pointless just like this film. In the dumbest way possible, they even gave life to the Jurassic logo. Dinosaurs are roaming the earth and it's treated in a ""just live with it"" approach, I was actually wishing this world would get destroyed from its stupidity. The threat of dinosaurs escaping to the mainland in Michael Crichton's books was a real nightmarish threat that he captured in the most terrifying ways. I have tremendous love and respect for life without a human voice, but Dominion's acceptance of a world with dinosaurs which wasn't the result of nature's intention but instead human/clone girl error is treated similar to the story in a children's pop-up book.The main conflict is about...locus. That's right! Not dinosaurs, but locus and farm crops. What is a plot about locus and the world's food supply doing in the Jurassic film where dinosaurs are physically roaming the earth? The Jurassic series is science fiction, and maybe a central conflict of a company releasing giant locus to threaten the world's food supplies might work in another story. To have a locus conflict this late in the series as the final built-up conflict was tragic. The build-up and cliffhanger in JW2 was dinosaurs are free to roam and terrorize the mainland. This should be the focusing conflict of your trilogy's finale. What were these filmmakers thinking?Lewis Dodgson is the character I always wished would return in the Jurassic sequels. A key sideline villain in Crichton's JP novel, and the main villain in Crichton's The Lost World novel. Dodgson finally returns, only he now looks like the CEO of Apple which is ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL.Was I suppose to picture Skyfall and The Bourne Ultimatum in the action sequences of a Jurassic film? No, but I was because the chase scene in the middle of the film was riddled with James Bond and Jason Bourne material. Remember how Pratt could hold up his hand with the raptors and it would trigger something in them? A move he'd been doing since they were babies. Let's call it, the Force, because now anyone can do it on any random dinosaur and it will hold them off, just like the Force. The film's stupidity has gone interstellar.Riddled with action cliches, excessive contrivances, conflict cliches, predictable outcomes, repeating visuals which no longer dazzle us, a complete lack of tension and terror, zero excitement, call backs to better films which have already been done in the previous Jurassic World films. Nothing is fresh, and what remains is stale. The film even damages its own trilogy by acknowledging characters and events in JP3, while forgetting there is another island called Site B with lots of dinosaurs roaming it.Remember the magic, the wonder, the awe, the thrills, the horrors, the excitement of Jurassic Park? All of this gone. Lost to a bunch of filmmakers who think bigger and more dinosaurs is all that matters rather than script and characters. The Lost World recaptured these elements the best. Even JP3 got some elements right when none of JW sequels did. I actually thought Fallen Kingdom was the lowest these Jurassic World films could go. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Dominion falls on the same level of bad as Fallen Kingdom did, but it might actually be worse. Dominion, just like The Last Jedi and Indy 5, is a franchise killer.",Notr

Directing was solid for the material, because at its long running time i was entertained and it wasn't boring as previous movie was.

But, at the end, I didn't feel like my day had been enriched by watching it and I have no desire to watch it again. The original Matrix, on the other hand, I still watch that at least once a year.

502,"I must admit I never expected a fourth film in this series, but here we are. Matrix 4 follows Neo - reborn into a new matrix as a computer game programmer who thinks that all the events in the original trilogy were part of a computer game that he created. When memories begin to surface, and people from his past re-enter his life, he must once again break free of the matrix and attempt to reawaken Trinity.This series sadly has been one of deminishing returns, and I was hoping that this 4th entry would break that decline... but sadly it does not. The most annoying thing is that the plot works... I can completely get behind the idea of the old matrix being a video game inside the new matrix. However, an utter slew of problems just drag the film down into a large pit of mediocrity despite this. The first problem is that aside from Neo and Trinity, the rest of the characters are 100% forgettable, including Morpheus (who is a new actor). Then there's the action, which is lukewarm at best. I get that Keanu is older now and perhaps would struggle with the high-octane stuff... but it looks like he isn't even trying half the time.But by far the biggest problem, is that the film 100% focuses on the love story between the leads and everything else is half baked. I get that it was important in the original trilogy, but even then it was just one aspect of a larger story. This film drives and drives the Neo loves Trinity plot point so much it begins to irritate, and since you obviously know they will fly off into the sunset together, the whole film just feels like its going through the motions.Overall this feels like a wasted opportunity to resurrect (sorry) this franchise and if you skip it you will miss precisely nothing. Disappointing...",Notr

504,"I have to say that I was really disappointed with this movie. Growing up with the originals, I remember how ground breaking they were and how much I looked forward to each one coming out. I know that you can't necessarily measure this movie against the trilogy and I went into it with that outlook but I still found that it just lacked the feel that the originals had, it didn't feel like the matrix completely.This movie seems like a mess, like they tried to cram 3 more movies into one and as such it moves very fast, to the point where I found it hard to even follow. I personally didn't like the casting for Agent Smith, I felt like he did not bring the same menace or authority to the role. You never really see Neo develop his skills, it just kinda happens. Also the constant snippets of the previous movies peppered into the movie did not fit for me, just seemed weird how they added that in.Overall this could have been so much better and honestly I don't think this movie adds anything to the original trilogy and nor does it add any real closure to the story or characters so I have to question what the point even was. It's weird because there is no plan on turning this into a trilogy, it's just a one off so what was the point? I give six stars because it made me nostalgic enough to want to watch the original trilogy again and the acting was good, the special effects were good. It's just a shame that they robbed so much from the originals and put them into this movie. Sometimes you watch a movie and it feels like they are making the movie just to make a movie, just because they can, not because it should be done. If you don't watch this movie, then you have not really missed anything.",Notr
505,"A lot of effort went into the story, with details and references and self references and in-jokes. And yet, in the last act of the film, it felt like who ever wrote the thing ran out of ideas and just did random things. That felt like a betrayal. Then there was the film itself, which consistently felt less evolved, in both effects and fight choreography, than the original film *from 22 years ago!*. Last but not least, there were the characters. Keanu and Carrie-Ann aside, the rest of the people had no characterization at all and the actors, some I knew from other stuff like Sense8, had less to work with than in the TV series they were grabbed from. Remember how awesome Max Riemelt was in Sense 8? Here he was a yes man with a bad accent. Remember how amazing and fun Lambert Wilson was in the original Matrix films? Here he was no more than an obscenity spouting homeless crazy person. I think Jonathan Groff did a reasonable job, but his character was all over the place. And so on.I don't want to touch on the sexual orientation of most of the actors or the agenda that is always pushed by the Wackowskis, because it doesn't really matter here. Put all that aside and it's still a mess of a film.Bottom line: if it were a random low budget scifi, it would have been average. As a sequel to The Matrix, it has great potential and it failed miserably.",Notr
506,"WB wanted a cash grab, Lana delivers us this urgent messageWe pride the first Matrix on making us think long after viewing the movie. I was so disappointed in this movie*, and all I could think of was what went wrong, so it was at least within the same spirit. I took it upon my self to try and find out..My theory:The first portion of the movie explains everything, and it's not even veiled. Lana name dropped Warner Brothers, which came as a bit of a 'shock' to hear, which was exactly it's intention. In this moment Lana has effectively removed you from the movie*. This is done in order to speak to you in person. She had the following message, ""WARNER BROTHERS said they would do it without us...~"" Take note, the way in which this sentence is worded the 'shock' is delivered first. In this portion of the movie Lana is Neo (actually she's always Neo). Neo expresses how there's no story to be told, because after the trilogy, the story was complete, but when you're in that position you feel as though your Art, your Passion is being threatened, so you might as well take the reigns.I apologize beforehand if I'm wrong, but I really believe the cat went up this tree. I honestly feel that this movie was intentionally sabotaged, or just not really taken that seriously. I say that because if we're still assuming that Lana is Neo, and Neo feels as though there's no need for a Matrix 4. Yet he still has to make it anyway for some big corporation that wants cash grab (before the year's end). When art pieces are as personal as The Matrix is to the Wachowski's it can be rather insulting when someone bypasses all the meaning behind it just to make a quick buck. So after Lana uses the first act of the movie* to explain to you why the Matrix 4 doesn't need to exist, and the remaining acts she just eked out something that resembled a movie just to get it past those corporate morons (and it worked). All Within the first act Lana's statement is complete. You can turn the movie* off, because what follows is Lana demonstrating what happens when you don't respect the work of an artist.The fact that Lawrence Fishburne wasn't even contacted, and the decision to move forward without Hugo Weaving actually makes sense now. It was actually done out of respect for the two veteran actors.I believe Lana knew that this movie* would tank, If the movie didn't tank they'd just ask for another, and another, yet the story was already completed. Having the movie tank works in her favor, to lower the value of the franchise so that it would be less likely to be looked at in such a disgustingly greedy way. However I don't know how effect that will be, WB always has the option to, ""do it without us (Wachowskis),"" and perhaps a spinoff might save the franchise, but a franchise isn't what Lana wantsSo all the rage and anger actually works in her favor, because a lot of viewers are in agreement with Lana when they say, ""No more Matrix movies.""and Again if we're still assuming Neo is Lana, Neo never makes the Matrix 4. I believe this may hint to this movie* as not being a part of 'The Matrix' at all, which is why I used an asterisk when referring to this movie*.Lana this was a genius way to get your point across. Perhaps too genius.",Notr
507,"This movie looses the magic of The Matrix. Everybody who's seen the previous three Matrix movies will be very disappointed. Everyone expects something similar to the famous bullet doge, or Neo vs. Smith, or even the final fight in the rain. But the movie delivers none of that. Every fight scene is full of fake-looking CGI, neither Neo nor Trinity really does any physical fighting. Instead, they just use their Matrix powers. You can't feel any impact during fight scenes. The majority of epic sequences are already in the trailer. The tone and pacing feel weird and there's very little chemistry between some of the new characters. The movie also has a lot of dull conversation while attempting to bring back nostalgia. This movie is overly reliant on the previous movies. There would be a reference to the trilogy once in a while, sometimes there will even be a scene directly from the trilogy. The whole movie just feels lazy. The only good sequence is towards the finale, when Neo and Trinity are motorcycling through the city.",Notr

Just some things still make no sense. Like the clips from the first movie are in all the wrong places. We know all the stuff they show us but we dont know what they didnt show us.

The progression of their story makes absolute sense when taking the entire franchise into context and ultimately gives us a Matrix movie that is far more personal than we've had before. They are not pushed aside to prop up newer characters and when I walked out of the theater I was not thinking about the action or special effects but instead the beautiful relationship between two human beings that reminds us what true love is all about.",Notr

The only thing good about this film are the moments of fights, CGI, and of course, it's nice to see Niobe, Trinity, and Neo.However, when you get to The Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) speech or to The Analyst (Patrick Haris), you come back to IMDB and edit your rating from ""terrible"" to ""hm, ok"".Haha :D The song from credits.

515,"This film is bold and for that I've given it bonus points. It's part romance, part violence and quite a bit of filler.The film reminds me of a art house project with a big budget. It feels fragmented as it switches between a romance/drama and hardcore action flick. I found myself being bored by the characters - not caring about them or their plight. They added nothing to the story.If I had to describe what was fun, it was revisiting the first Matrix film, it was seeing a ""fan fiction"" film made by a wachowsky. It was seeing Neo and Trinity engaging each other. I also enjoyed Neil Patrick Harris with some of his dialogue - he was spot on at times.Overall, it's an OK film. It's too different from the original. It lacks thought provoking. The action scenes feel flat. The characters don't do much. The motives are not strong.I'd give it a go. Support the gamble taken in making this film: it's genuinely different. Just think romance with martial arts and it might help.Contains at least one graphic scene.

They also managed to make a decent story, have good action scenes, and get the actors to give it their best shot. Again, it doesn't compare to the original but it's good enough to make you forget Reloaded and Revolutions, and just for that it's a great movie in my book.",Notr

518,"Resurrections concludes Neo and Trinity's Journey through the matrix. It's the 3rd and final film in the trilogy, and takes place mostly in the real world, not the virtual one. That's probably not a good thing. They bring on quite a few new characters but it's more like an anime than live action and the outfits have a whiff of Cosplay about them.It has its moments, but it's not a great film, overall. The Matrix is one of the most consequential films ever made. They didn't seem certain of where to go when they were tasked to make more movies for the franchise. Nevertheless, there's elements that shine. Visually, the big budget shows. By now, that's a slur for me. Big budgets seem to detract more from the final product than add to it. Still, the fight scenes are awesome.Bad news first. Some lines are too cheesy, such as Niobe saying the other ship has a 'fat ass' 😖. They've alluded to Zion's history, but we should have been given more information on Zion and what's been happening there over the years. Overall, the plot is weak and fairly confusing. The character development and dialogue are nothing special, either.There's some amusing scenes. Niobbi scares Morpheous when she's flying and he can't keep up. Did they use actual vegetable steamers for the sentinels? It cracks me up every time. Many people complain about Matrix Revolutions, but I love the film. It has some dead ends and things that aren't necessary, but, DANG, Morpheus takes out an SUV with a sword! The albino twins are fun, and the Merovingian is a fantastic character. In Resurrection, he seems to have neverending olives for his martinis. He's a blast.Every Matrix film is just so Asian- that's a good thing. Their entertainment is among the best in the world. The blind monk/messiah is a good example. The philosophy is Asian. The action is Asian fusion. It's marvelous.Logic vs emotions is one of the themes. ""Only the human mind can come up with something as pathetic as love,"" an agent asserts. I'm not so sure about that. Love, music and the arts are divine gifts, not random accidents, in my humble estimation. As always, humans are banding together to fight a threat, but the human threat is always one of the worst: The defense minister thinks it's all about him - /he's/ the savior. He's another politician who overestimates his own relevance. That's just art imitating life.Everything leading up to the end has its problems, but the final wrap up is excellent. ""Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo."" Neo means ""new"". There's a word maze for you. The best showdowns are always in the rain. Directors can't seem to help it. There's a nice shot of Smith looking down at Neo, in the rain, followed by great shock waves of water pouring over them like hot fudge.The Matrix is the story of a Messiah. Our Messiah suffers. His journey is often solitary, though Trinity is an archangel, of sorts. Neo's final move is bathed in light. It's beautiful. Light is everywhere. It's like the whole thing was made of light. Then we see a ✝ of light and a silhouette of a Jesus figure showing through the light. East meets West. It's not that they push a view, but their Christian imagery is powerful. Throughout the Matrix, the colors are drab, greenish and dusty. The world is lackluster. Neo brings light. Let the sun shine through until the haunting RGB sunset bids us 'adieu'.🌅",Notr

526,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Matrix"" (1999) is in my TOP 3 movies of all time. I was a teenager when it came out and i basically grew up with it. I liked ""Reloaded"" and even ""Revolutions"" was pretty OK movie.Cut to almost 20 years later and we have ""The Matrix Resurrections"" (2021). I was exited after the amazing trailer, yet the track record of movies that Wachowski made after ""Revolutions"" was not giving many hopes. And after seeing latest one on a premier day just now i can say that ""Resurrections"" is the worst movie I've seen in many moons, unfortunately. It was excruciatingly bad.Story was a mess. Writing was horrible. It was so poorly written that audience was started to laugh at things that were not supposed to be funny. Directing was terrible. The only good thing in this disaster was Jessica Henwick's acting - she was good. And Keanu Reeves just sleepwalked trough the whole thing.Overall, ""Resurrections"" felt like a parody of the original trilogy - i kid you not. You have to see by yourself Jada Pinkett Smith's Niobe to believe it - and i will say nothing more. It literally felt like a sequel to ""Battlefield Earth"" (2000) rather to one of the best films ever made. On the other hand - in its 2 h 20 min run time it wasn't boring - with my broken heart i can safely say that ""The Matrix Resurrections"" was so bad that it was actually fun to watch.

I did appreciate that the creators were trying to create a new entry in the franchise without dumping on what has come before it. But herein lies the problem...The bad: The film treads the same paths from the original films (quite literally) - resulting in a trip that's totally unnecessary. It does not offer anything new or innovative when we know this can be done successfully (see Top Gun Maverick / Bladerunner 2049). Unfortunately, it doesn't end there. The choreography and cinematography are somehow worse than the previous films. The fight scenes are repetitive, uninventive and rely heavily on rapid cuts, with plot armour and convenient power manifestation being the cherries on top. And finally, there are wasted (new and legacy) characters who add little or nothing to the narrative. Existing solely because the filmmakers believe their mere presence will be sufficient to justify their existence. It does not, and they end up degrading the film instead of elevating it with their contribution to the unfolding story.Should you watch it: I had low expectations going into this film - and I would say it met them. My biggest criticism is that the movie's contribution to the legacy of The Matrix is superfluous. Resurrections adds nothing new and repeats the same beats that came before it but delivered worse in every aspect. Fortunately, it doesn't destroy the Matrix-verse by it's existence, so watch it if only to satisfy your curiosity (like I did) or just watch the original Matrix again.",Notr
534,I had a horrible feeling 2 minutes into the film it was going to be bad. The film is very off. No Morpheus no Matrix and what is with the incessant need to show clips from the original film every minute like we don't know what they are referring to.It feels like they made this to a younger audience who have never heard of The Matrix and needed reminding with the constant references to the first.I feel sick.,Notr
535,"The first act is a clever and tightly edited setup that does a great job at hinting that there is a larger idea behind this movie, an idea about the state of the world post trilogy that needs Neo to return.Then the movie hits an almost literal wall. It just stops. People start expositing, a lot, and it's awkward, obtuse dialog too, often in complete silence like a homemade movie without a score. Characters act, but, with the exception of Neo, we don't understand why. Interesting developments about the post-trilogy world are introduced, but just as quickly as they're mentioned they cease to matter. From this point forward, good guys are good because they're good, bad guys are bad because they're bad, and they play their parts like hollow automata around Neo trying to reach Trinity.This transition between the first act and the rest of the movie is black and white. A real pity.",Notr

The Matrix makes you wonder if we are in a computer generated world and if our life isn't real. In this one it makes you believe it more with the way the world is filled with hate and are we being controlled to fear each other by being under a higher power. The story is amazingly connected with the original 3, it has the action, the power of love with Neo and Trinity, it does have the Nostalgia but new at the same time. I was very impressed but I'm also a bigger fan of Resurrected than I am of Reloaded and I know that one was also frowned upon.

539,"This movie is completely unnecessary to the Matrix world as sometimes it doesn't even feel like a Matrix movie. If not for the many original trilogy flashbacks sometimes I though I was seeing some king of John Wick 3.5 or any other sci-fi-action movie with Keanu Reeves. His performance is forgetable and sometimes looks like he's parodying himelf. The rest of the cast never got my attention, neither the story, and I have to be honest. I felt the story to be so bad and uninteresting that I had to use my smartphone a lot to avoid sleeping.I'm not saying you shouldn't watch the movie but be ready for nothing like the original trylogy in any item you can rate a movie. Not even the fight scenes are good as they are badly choreographed and filmed, and the special effect are just the same as any other 2021 movie.

We should be thankful we get to go back to The Matrix at all and enjoy the ride, not be so arrogant to dismiss it with the rating of a reprehensible, unwatchable pile of garbage.

I even hated every single action sequence. It was so repulsive I had to look at memes on half a screen to lessen the pain enough to finish the film. Turns out there wasn't a single enjoyable second there to find, yet I still feel brave for having watched it all the way, making it the single worst movie I've ever finished.

It were kind of based on some Indian philosophies. When the trailer first came out what came to my mind was concept of rebirth, where Neo & Trinity are in Matrix and Zion is free. To add further Zion is free to free for those who want to be freed. A movie developed over such story would have been aced more.This is where I say the effort as average.

A new film after The original trilogy where it was all wrapped up with closure was something I looked at with some cautiousness because as much as I wanted to believe in Lana Wachowski, I was not really convinced there was room for a sequel, especially when the trailer dropped and it looked like it's just recycling the original ideas. But the film took a path that is perfect for such a movie in ways that I never thought possible.From the very first scene, it brought us back to the very beginnings of the franchise and then they started asking questions.""It's all deja vu, but something's not right.""
""Why are they using the same code to create something new?""From that point onwards, I knew what kind of a film it was and it followed suit till the end magnificently. Every single dialogue in The Matrix, be it callbacks or original was quotable. The film knows what it is. It knows why it exists. It knows what the fans want to see. And it delivers in a way so that everyone knows what it is and have fun with it. The film unlike its predecessors is more interested in giving answers. Answers we don't really want to hear but would help if we can understand why these answers exist and what questions lead to these answers.This film easily is gonna be a divisive one. Either people will be unimpressed by its idiosyncrasy or be amused by it enough to see the honestness of it behind all the tentpole extravaganza. I really want to see this film again and have a lot more thoughts to unpack for which I would really need to give my brain more time.",Notr
547,"I remember seeing the Matrix in the cinema as a young kid and it blew my mind. It was the essence of cool, combining a then unfamiliar Hong Kong aesthetic with cutting edge special effects, heady themes, and of course bringing bullet time to the forefront of modern cinema. Visually it was soo revolutionary that the 2003 sequels were never able to recapture that impact, and this sequel is no exception.Nowadays there isn't a single superhero movie that hasn't been built on the Matrix's special effects and evolved it to such a level that Resurrections would have truly have had to have been unique to have the same impact as the original, which is something that I doubt anyone was expecting, so all I was asking for was a solid, well thought out, storyline. And that sadly is something that Resurrection does not have. Hell, half of the movie seems to just be footage from the first three movies, one quarter is millennial characters moaning about millennial issues, and one quarter seems to be new, albeit pointless, content.I can see why Hugo, after reading the script, turned down the chance to reprise his Agent Smith role. I would have done the same if I'd have read the script too. And casting Neil Patrick Harris as a villain? He was so miscast that he was comically bad; I genuinely felt embarrassed for him and his performance. Keanu too, sadly, put it a terrible performance, arguable the worst of his career, and Carrie-Anne Moss was clearly just walking in her performance. Jessica Henwick seemed to be about the only one who could be bothered to act in this movie but sadly her storyline was just as dull as the rest of the movie.Morpheus once said that unfortunately no-one can be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself. Well I'm telling you now that you do not need to see the movie to know that it's bad. Sometimes you should just leave sleeping dogs lie.",Notr

549,"This film is a cash grab, forced into existence by the hand of Warner Brothers, and tasked with replicating what was great about the original Matrix movies as best as possible. If this wasn't obvious, the film actually tells you this in the first opening scenes of the film.Of course, this is kind of a cop out. An attitude of ""We know we're never going to be as good as the first - so why try?"".That in itself is an interesting philosophical concept that the film begins to explore. What's left to continue the story with after you've already told the story? Tell it again with all new characters? Get a replacement for Laurence Fishburne? Get a bunch of fanboys and fangirls to drag Keanu Reeves out of retirement to play a version of Neo that just wants to be left alone to eat blue pills all day? Revisit the old haunts to see what they're all doing now? Rehash scenes of the old films to make a kind of ""clip movie""?Trying to rehash a classic film and failing to surpass it's insurmountable first outing is an interesting jumping off point for philosophical discussion. It gets a good start on this in the first part of the film, but as it travels along it doesn't deliver on the promise of a sensible resolution. It just throws in action sequences and integrates a hard-to-follow plot that's confusing, even for fans of the Matrix familiar with how it's universe works.There's a few good philosophical dialogue scenes, but it doesn't really tie into the rest of the plot and feels disjointed. In fact the film's pace and aesthetics can't even match what came before. The whole thing feels like a made for TV film and structurally contrived. Using the ""it was all a dream"" trope in the writing felt lazy - if even the film itself admitted that it was a cop out.The thing is that our heroes can never destroy the Matrix. It has to continue to exist for future sequels or this licensed property will have to stay dead!... but if that's the case, and with no hope of ever achieving this conclusion, the series will die a different kind of unsatisfying death.",Notr

Everything else to the story was random, farfetched and confusing. It almost felt like a movie made by a youtuber with some Keanu Reeves cameos. They not only did injustice to the trilogy, the characters actually mocked it, openly, with the tons of sarcasm in referral to the first Matrix movies.Zero love and talent went into this.

552,"3.5 out of 5 stars.The Matrix Resurrections is a pretty fair science fiction action film that succeeds as a sequel in continuing the franchise. After the third film Revolutions concluded the story arc. Yes, it succeeds as a sequel. Yes, returning characters like Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, and even Jada Pinkett Smith making almost an unrecognizable appearance. The story is a bit mix, it works and also feels kind of weak compared to previous films. It works in continuing as a fourth installment without giving too much details. Old characters making a return as new faces played by new actors like Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Jonathan Groff. Jessica Henwick also stealing the spotlight as Bugs. Neill Patrick Harris playing an Analyst.The story is pretty decent. Characters back in the Matrix world. And new threats are on the rise. The future world is also running a little different as well. Story is weaker compared to the trilogy which a lot is at stake. Resurrections is reigniting the franchise. And maybe opening the doors to something more if they make sequels.The action sequences are awesome. Slo mo is back with characters fighting and dodging bullets. The climatic motorcycle chase with Trinity and Neo being chased by an army of swarm bots that's taking control of the people is thrilling. The visual effects are cool and the futuristic world is stunning seeing that back on the big screen.Keanu Reeves is back as Neo. Starting the film feeling lost in the matrix world did have a slow start for the first half hour. Carrie Anne-Moss playing Tiffany who is a mother and has a family now was different. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is decent in his role which is different for the character he is playing. Jessica Henwick is awesome as Bugs and stole the show. Jonathan Groff also is great as the new agent and also stole the spotlight for his short role. Neill Patrick Harris is good as the analyst. Priyanka Chopra Jonas is good playing a character that has a connection from previous films.The weakest part about the film besides the story not being its strong moment. The pacing of the film can be slow at times or run a little too long at dramatic moments. The film did have a slow start until Neo noticing something is wrong with the world.Overall, The Matrix Resurrection is a pretty fair come back with mind blowing action, visual effects and cast ensemble. Pacing and story might be its weak points. It was great to see it in theatres.",Notr
553,"This is so cheap that they basically remade the first film yet made it also a sequel at the same time. The majority of the film has the same structure as the first film and most scenes are exactly the same just altered...The good thing is that CGI is very high quality, but at the same time action scenes feel so generic and uninspired, way inferior to the original film, I admit a few moments were cool, but most action not only feel weak but poorly executed like fights feel like they were made by people who don't know how to fight so they just try to imitate what fighting supposed to look like from what they've seen somewhere else.Music is trying real hard to imitate the soundtrack of original films yet feels weaker and more like rip-offs than remixes or remakes of old tracks.What's up with all the references and literally showing footage from previous films? Do they think we have forgotten the films completely? But the insulting part is that film acknowledges that it references itself to the point that it literally tells that fact a few times - as a joke? I guess, sort of breaking the 4th wall but not really I guess. It's just so lame.There are also so many embarrassing scenes, I laughed so hard at some of the stuff that if this film isn't meme material - I don't know what is then.Also, many of the returning characters often feel completely out of character, and I despise how they treated most characters that do not return for this film. It feels like that Matrix parody by CollegeHumor.Most importantly this feels very long (and it is), yet it shows almost nothing cool, most of it just replicates the first film also making it somehow longer yet worse in every way with the only exception being a much better CGI. It's such a shame that such uninspired sequels like this exist.",Notr

Cringe-inducing throwbacks, poor film quality, bad cliches and a non-existent story. The fight scenes are dumb, the climaxes non-climaxial, nothing engaging or thought provoking at all. Characters are entirely forgettable.It's like a group of people who had never seen The Matrix decided they needed to make another one.

More information, more open to interpretation than perhaps even the original Matrix. I'm not comparing, just saying that this is different and it leaves me wanting to understand more.

559,"The fourth chapter in the groundbreaking franchise that redefined a genre finds its visionary creator returning to the fold and add a new spin to the enduring legacy of The Matrix Trilogy. The Matrix Resurrections serves not only as a sequel, reboot & remake but also as a critique of it all, taking a dig on its parent studio & overly obsessed fans with its self-referential quips while offering a story that's destined to polarise its audience.Produced, co-written & directed by Lana Wachowski (Bound & Cloud Atlas), the approach & aesthetics for this latest entry are way different from the original trilogy as it attempts to chart a new course while functioning as a continuation of the same saga. The first half of the film is meta-galore and there is a lot of cringe & exposition to steer through in order to meet it on its wavelength but even after all the familiar beats, it evokes a different feeling.Unlike its predecessors which operate as action sci-fi, this one mainly falls under the domain of romance sci-fi with more emphasis on love & its ability to transcend the boundaries of real & digital world, which in turn offers Keanu Reeves & Carrie-Anne Moss new emotional depths to explore as Neo & Trinity and the actors more than deliver on that, their moments brimming with palpable tension & intimacy. The other characters however are more or less forgettable.Overall, The Matrix Resurrections is no match to the originality & perfection of the first film or pure unabashed spectacle of the sequels that followed but it still retains the rich mythology & endless curiosities of the saga and definitely belongs to this world. While it is our affection for the central characters that does the heavy lifting here, the interest in the story never for once fizzles out, thus making it an intriguing addition to the series despite being the weakest of the four films.

560,"I'm still not really sure what I watched. I feel like nothing really happened in this film.For a 2.5 hour film, there should've been more of a climax or resolution. It's very light on action and the action that does transpire is lackluster to say the least.I enjoyed the start of the film, excluding the unnecessary retread of the original film's opening. The White Rabbit sequence and everything with Neo questioning his existence was compelling. The meta commentary was okay at first, but seemed really out of place the more they hammered it home. The constant flashbacks to the original were weird and just reminded me that I could've been watching a better Matrix film.Keanu is as watchable as ever and the relationship with Trinity is solid stuff. I enjoyed Groff and NPH quite a bit in their roles. The recasting thing was odd and the explanation is pretty weak, but the actors did as well as they could, having to live up to some iconic performances. I'm not a massive fan of the franchise, but I still expected something more from this film than empty nostalgia.",Notr
561,"Of course it's not as good as the first one and thankfully it's a lot better than the 2nd and 3rd ones. You do need to have seen at least the 1st one to have any idea of what's going on, so newbies should start there.I'll start with the positives - the action scenes are great - it was never going to be as ground-breaking as the first one but the camera work in the fight scenes is spectacular - you feel right in the middle of the action. It must be seen on a big screen - the crisp images and thumping sounds make it feel like a digital remastering of your favourite 1970s music.In the ""OK"" category is the storyline. Vaguely credible, not at all original but probably just about enough to write the 4th film. Some nice references back to the original series and Keanu Reeves plays the confused hero well once again.But the disappointing bit is both the ending (won't spoil it) and the overall feeling that something is missing. To continue the music metaphor, it's like watching a mediocre cover-band playing your favourite band's music. It ticks some of the boxes but is nowhere as good as the real thing.It was always going to be hard to come close to the quality of the 1st Matrix and it really doesn't. But I've certainly seen worse and the time did go fairly quickly after a slightly slow (but deliberately so) start. For big Matrix fans it'll probably do enough to make it feel worthwhile, but if you weren't a fan of the first series, there's nothing new for your here.7/10 for me.",Notr
562,"So what if you could remake the original Matrix film, but this time without the big reveal of what the Matrix is and add a twist that tries to explain why you could do that? It's like an idea you joke around about but not actually make into a film that you've made before. And in typical Hollywood fashion, they remake the same thing but just bigger, flashier, with things they think are even cooler, - and results in something so much dumber. Things in this Matrix don't need to make sense provided they look cool, which is all that matters.This Matrix should have stayed dead. Action? No, not really, at least not for a very large part of it - and the kung fu actually sucks. This is The Matrix: A Love Story. But this time, with just cooler looking characters and mumbo jumbo that explains the technology stuff in a way that doesn't make sense to us people but it does to the actors, who nod their heads and smile as if they really know what that techno gobbledygook means.""Wow, this code is freaky!!!!"" one actor says in excitement! LOL, the film becomes a parody of itself, along with replacement actors who can't help but try their best to mimic the iconic performances of a cast that happened to have been cast perfectly.

563,"As ""The Matrix Resurrections"" (2021 release; 147 min.) opens, a woman named Bugs seems to have traced Trinity, who was long thought to be lost. As Bugs closes in, San Francisco cops are about to arrest Trinity, but she manages to escape, spectacularly of course. As does Bugs. Meanwhile, we meet up with Neo, now named Thomas Anderson and being a famous gaming developer, using his dreams of the Matrix as a base for these games. He also meets regularly with his shrink... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: upon the conclusion of the original Matrix trilogy in 2003, the Wachowskis famously declared they could not envision any further Matrix movies. What exactly it is that tempted Lana (erstwhile Larry) Wachowski to reconsider after all these years is not clear to me, but as a fan of the original trilogy (even with the 3rd film substantially below par), I couldn't help but be excited about a new installment. Having seen it now, I'm sorry to report that this is a mixed bag at best. The movie struggles to find an overall theme that would've necessitated a 4th Matrix film. Initially, we (and the characters) struggle to figure out what is real and what is fantasy. I mean it gets so confusing that the Keanu Reeves character keeps commenting, as much to himself as he does to the audience, ""assuming this is real"", and then ""this is not the real world!"". Yes, the script goes down a rabbit hole so deep that it doesn't know anymore which side is up or down. A different overall theme becomes clearer in the movie's second half, and that, combined with some truly spectacular action scenes, make for a better experience (by a mile or two) as opposed to the first half. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprise their roles from the original trilogy. Neil Patrick Harris has fun playing the ""baddie"". Christina Ricci has a small (less than 5 min.) role. But in the end, everyone is secondary to the action and fight scenes as well as the overall production set. The running time of 2 1/2 hrs is a bit misleading as the closing credits literally run for 12 min., and yes, you'll want to see through all of it as there is a surprise at the very end of them...""The Matrix Resurrections"" opened in theaters yesterday and also started streaming on HBO Max, where I caught it. While the movie is too long and too clever for its own good, the bottom line is that I could've chosen to stop watching at any time, but I didn't...

Where do I start well it's with the cast neo, trinity and agent Smiths story began and ended twenty years ago to a solid conclusion they had a beginning middle and end. Yet their plucked from the abyss and resurectcted.The first forty of so minutes are ok but the film keeps showing flash backs of the original trilogy which just reminds the viewer how superior they were to this mess of a sequel.There are some good ideas here and it looks gorgeous in 4k but the most interesting plot point is wasted a machine civil war less than thirty seconds screen time. Wow that really should of been the plot of this movie with a new generation of protagonists not relying on old characters that told their story. Then there's the action you can say what you like about matrix reloaded and revolutions but dam those movies had exceptional action sequences I was literally bored watching neo take on agent smith again here. Then there's the runtime the most bloated of them all. It's a miss fire and a complete waste of the source material. Disappointing is a understament.",Notr

Don't get me wrong, The Matrix is still a true classic, compared to Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss performance from there previous films over the years after. But for this year, they still nailed there part as Neo and Trinity. Even tho there getting a little older as you think. Lana Wachowski involved with the fourth installment and tries to connect the story of how Neo and Trinity got resurrected and clearly not the exact story of what we think it is at some point.

576,"This movie left me feeling like blade runner 2. What do I mean blade runner 2 was clearly set in the blade runner universe but it felt like you were watching a movie made by a fan where everything was just a little off and this new Matrix feels the same.A couple of things that stood out for me was the colour grading was missing, in the previous 3 movies they colour graded the scenes depending upon where the characters were which gave the trilogy a definitive feel, this movie didn't have it and it was noticeable. Also the action shots and fight scenes in the other movies were wide angle fairly long shots whereas this movie has the usual up close jump around camera bs that a lot of modern movies suffer from.I know this is from one of the original creators but they just seem to of missed everything that made the first trilogy great by a small amount.Also the concept for the story was decent it just wasn't that well executed. The new architect didn't feel like part of the machine world and neither did the Smith character, similarly we've had 3/4 movies already with the agents appearing with a very specific look and sound and now we don't and it's lost something. The action doesn't feel tense at any point it just feels directionless as does the plot.

That's the kind of sequels we are used to in Hollywood and most of the public seems perfectly happy with that. This a Matrix love story. This is incredibly meta (believe me, see that first act!). The issue is that...it doesn't work that well.The love story between Neo and Trinity is the main plot and some scenes between them are ok, but nothing transcendental. Mostly cheesy, to be honest. Surprisingly, the characters I like the most are two new ones: Bugs (Jessica Henwick) and The Analyst (Neil Patrick Harris). Both of the actors did a great job and made me preferred a story more about them than the story we had. The first act of the film is ultra self-aware, the action is very Marvel style (you can't see anything), visuals are as good as ever, there is a stupid amount of flashbacks and it feels very small compared with the og trilogy. There are no big things at stake, so you never have a feeling of urgency. There are a lot of references to non-binary things, to freedom, to comfort, to love, even to ""being too late to wake up"". But it doesn't fee that fresh compared to what we had seen before.It hurts that someone tried something so different and it failed. I was even tempted to say the film has as many good things as bad things. The problem is that the good things are never memorable. Maybe a 2nd watch will help this one.",Notr

1-) There are too much new details and flow is too fast. Many details are being covered so fastly and slightly because of movie length, despite it is too long. That is why, i couldn't understand clearly and feel to ""rewind"" at many points. This film absolutely should be 2 part! One 2,5 hour film is not enough to cover everything.2-) Fight scenes are not at an enough level. Both from amount and content aspects. Kung-Fu scenes are not enough attractive and artistic. Keanu Reeves was much more serial at Reloded and Revolution.3-) Tension is absolutely the most absent thing in this film in comparison with trilogy. The flow is going on a plain level.

586,"The stage curtains open ...There was something that bothered me back when I had finished watching ""The Matrix Revolutions"" back in 2003. Something that had gotten under my skin. Now, here in the year 2021, I'd forgotten what it was ... until I watched ""The Matrix Resurrections"". Then it was like total recall and I remembered everything that bothered me nearly 20 years ago. And again ... I was left feeling the same way.Neo is dead right? Apparently not. We catch up with Thomas A. Anderson, a successful video game programmer who has based a trilogy of video games on his dreams of the Matrix. He is unsettled, and the company is pushing for a sequel that will push the envelope even further. Then he receives a text message from none other than Morpheus. Hardly believing what he is seeing, he follows the white rabbit once more to find himself back in the real world as Neo. Everything has changed, and there are new players and new rules - but when he finds out there is a chance to be reunited with Trinity, he lays it all on the line.What made the first three movies special, the original Matrix movie especially, is missing here. There was a certain feel, a certain mood that this 4th film does not capture. It tries to by revisiting scenes and recreating moments, but ultimately, these fall flat. The Oracle is gone, the Architect is gone, others have died, changed, or aged dramatically. The Matrix is stronger, and more advanced - being run now by the Analyst. Oh yes ... Agent Smith? He's still around.I enjoyed the underlying love story between Neo and Trinity, and the respect given to them by supporting characters. The action sequences were well filmed, and the production values are high. All the actors were invested, and not just there because it could be done...but because it seemed to matter to them. However, this isn't anything special. 6 stars out of 10.Oh,..and that thing that bothered me and bothers me still? The Matrix is still there. Even after all this time. Humanity is still imprisoned and in pods under the control of the machines. Nothing has been won. These small battles they are winning, are only distractions from the big picture. If they ever make a Matrix movie where all of this is finally defeated and mankind is truly freed, then that would be a movie worth applauding.",Notr

After watching this newest instalment I don't understand the widespread negativity towards the film. It is done in a unique way which is not cheesy or expected and the plot is different enough from the original films that it feels fresh while still keeping the aesthetics that the fans love.My only issues with the film was that it had way too many flashback scenes of the previous film and the beginning set up took up most of the movie and then the end felt rushed.

'Resurrections' uses CGI to complete a lot of their action sequences, but it's nothing groundbreaking like it was before.Reeves and Moss fall into their characters of old without missing a beat. Newcomers to the franchise, Neil Patrick Harris and Jessica Henwick were also good. New Morpheus edition was interesting. Smith replacement... that's a tall order and unfortunately the character is just not the same without Weaving.I'm not exactly sure where this one lies among the other two sequels.

Yes, this has many problems. It being Leftist is not one of them - this series has been that from the very start. I was pleasantly surprised that it is communicating a new message, rather than simply restating the old one. Both are progressive. One of the big issues here is, why does this exist? And ultimately the answer is: the studio wanted profit and they threatened Lana Wachowski that they would make this with or without her. It's clear that while she still has a passion for this property, she doesn't have that many brand new ideas. We mostly get variations on the old ones.This is a soft reboot, in the vein of Star Wars Episode 7, although in some ways it is more similar to Nightmare on Elm Street Part 7. There's a lot of love expressed for legacy characters by new ones. Countless references. They are excessive in amount and frequency. With that said, I'm not sure why people are freaking out that this reuses a bunch of footage from the trilogy... whenever it does that, it is because someone is hallucinating, remembering, seeing through the illusion of The Matrix. The action is bad in choreography(bland, uninspired, boring), cinematography and editing(way too rapidly cut, rather than the long takes we're used to). On the plus side, this does have compelling scenarios for them, ones that fit in the universe and aren't retreads. This looks like it was cheap which it wasn't. The darkness and seriousness has been replaced by brighter elements and it's odd that it feels like this is trying to sell toys when it's R-rated. No, this is not made for people who haven't memorized the first three(why on earth would it be?). The villains are incredibly entertaining, we have as much fun watching them as they did playing them(a huge amount).This features some strong language and a lot of bloody violence.

All the fightscenes are done with very quick close up camera cuts, I cant tell whats going on. Compare this with the longer, wider shots in the subway scene of the first matrix. What are the rules in this universe? I don't care about Neo and Trinitys love. The meta matrix game thing is so on the nose it feels like a joke. It feels like this movie is a joke, they must have been pressured to make it. And after years of failed movies the money they offered to make it kept getting higher.

Second was alright and I fell asleep halfway thru opening night of the third. The sunglasses and coolness got to me.As to this actual movie, I don't see why anyone would dislike it if they enjoyed the others. The whole franchise has had mixed results changing actors. Not securing Hugo Weaving really hurts it I'd say. However the whole Morpheus switch worked okay for me, though they explanation/flashbacks seemed off somehow . Action scenes were alright. Depends who's fighting. It's more varied fighting, less of the 9min Kung fu battles that never looked like they hurt. I'm trying to remember if Neo ever holds a gun in this one.. not that it really matters. Kinda weird he seems to lose flight but grows this sorta force blast thing.

After watching it I have mixed feelings.The movie is very long and they take their sweet time ( 45 mins ) to introduce us again with the franchise. The good news is that they manage to bring us up to speed in a way that isn't too far fetched or isn't retconned into oblivion. Downside is that the first hour is very slow so don't expect action from start to finish.From there on out the pace picks up but the monologues of the bad guys reminded me of the one from the Architect in Matrix 2. If you are a fan it's doable but new fans will probably zone out or it will be over their heads ( watch the trilogy before you watch this one ! )The last 30 min of the movie has lots of moving parts and interaction and I probably will have to watch it a couple more times before it all sinks in. If it is done right like in Inception I don't mind at all but my first impression was not positive. Seriously, it's a mess that's all over the place.If this was intended as a stand alone film it's a big fail, however this has all the signs of a second trilogy and then I can understand why they introduce so many new concepts and bring back so many old characters this late.That being said, the movie suffers from the.lack of Weaving and Fishburne. The nods to the original movie is fan service at it's worst, trust the audience to recognize the lines or the scenes without showing old clips to spell it out ! Matrix fans can connect the dots without being spoon fed.Overall I have the same feeling I had when I first saw Star Wars episode 7. Something familiar, something new, but they've made this movie a couple decades ago already (better) . Nothing revolutionary, nothing iconic except for some really cleaver lines that make fun of their own franchise.If you are a die hard fan you'll probably rate this better than 3 but if you are new to the franchise I don't think this movie will turn your world upside down like the first one did for us.Let's hope we'll get 2 more but fingers crossed it's done by both sisters.

It's convoluted, messy, and generic all at the same time. Not necessary viewing for Matrix fans.",Notr
615,"I have heard all the negative reviews, but still decided to watch this. This was such a mistake.From the very beginning I was holding myself from turning it off, but eventually I couldn't handle it anymore. This is just a pure garbage, that tries to look clever and interesting. In reality it is horrible in literally every aspect: plot, casting, action sequences, some weird Marvel-like jokes that seem totally out of place. I really can't understand how a movie that came out in 2021 can look so much worse than the original, that came out 22 years before.Do yourself a favor - don't watch this trash and save some good memories about era-defining original.",Notr
616,"The Matrix Resurrections is the fourth film, in the Matrix franchise. Mr. Anderson(Keanu Reeves) has to once again find out, if he's inside the Matrix & must choose to find out the truth about his world.The Matrix Resurrections is a great movie. Writer-director Lana Wachowski has given us a more self-aware and tongue in cheek sequel to a trilogy, that really didn't need a fourth installment. These meta references to the original trilogy are the highlight of the film. The action set pieces are brilliant. Keanu Reeves is spectacular as Neo. Carrie-Anne Moss is outstanding as Trinity. Reeves & Moss share electrifying chemistry, in all their scenes together. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is impressive as Morpheus but, I definitely missed Laurence Fishburne. Jonathan Groff is memorable as Smith. Jessica Henwick is awesome as Bugs. Neil Patrick Harris is hysterical as The Analyst. Jada Pinkett Smith is good as Niobe. Priyanka Chopra Jonas is superb as Sati. The supporting cast is effective. The Matrix Resurrections is worth a watch, for fans of The Matrix trilogy. Just keep your expectations, relatively low.",Notr
617,"I asked myself that like 80% it was hardcore confusing there for a minute. Look in a world of reboots, remakes and lack of originality, Matrix took a page from the self-aware and decided to make a fun, satire, crazy sequel literally no one asked for. Its just big dumb fun, and escape from the reality, you know like how movies are supposed to be.Still alot of Dragonball Z fiht scenes though.",Notr
618,"I really wanted to like this, and I admit it has its moments, but even considering the hate of the second and third installment, this is the worst matrix movie of them all.The dialogue seems superficial, uninviting and even comic at some points. The pace of the movie is too consistant, and gives no room to breathe and enjoy the depth and thoughts of any of the characters.The ""matrix is a game"" theme could have worked, but ended up as an unfunny parody.Even the song in the ending I would guess should be a nod to the rage against the machine track used in the original, but using ""Brass against"" is another cringe worthy parody.Save your theatre money and watch it on your couch a sunday afternoon, when you have nothing else to do.",Notr

On a second viewing the key scene where Sheperd tells Neo ""Everything was simpler back then. People wanted to be free. It's different now. Sometimes it feels like people gave up. Like the Matrix won."" The Matrix won because we've all become so addicted to the noise constantly being pumped at us or as Merv puts it ""Face-Zucker-Suck"". The Analyst plays on our desires and fears ""Quietly yearning for what you don't have, while dreading losing what you do"". It's a direct commentary on the state of our world today.

The story was interesting(although it was more like side-story when compared to trilogy), i liked all the nostalgia stuff and callbacks to previous films, the humour was suprisingly well done and it didn't feel insulting to the series and i think they explained a lot of what happened since the trilogy took place really well. What i didn't like was the action scenes, because come on - It's MATRIX - where almost everything is possible, they could be a little bit more creative, Neo could be more creative.",Notr

623,"Even though the nostalgia can be too much and heavy handed at times, the Matrix Resurrections is the best Matrix sequel so far, an appropriately meta, stylish and surprisingly funny film that's also got plenty of heart and interesting new ideas.Keanu Reeves gives an incredible lead performance with plenty of charm and is once again able to anchor the film's more surreal and pretentious moments. Carrie-Anne Moss is great and has strong chemistry with Keanu. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is effortlessly cool and suave and Jessica Henwick gives the best performance out of the new characters.Lana Wachowski's direction is really good, it's visually slick with well filmed action set pieces, even if they aren't as satisfyingly clean as the previous ones. The CG is mostly impressive and the music by Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer is also really good, less hi-tech sounding than the previous ones.",Notr

Negatives: Plot is 90% exposition and one 10% of that is relevant. Meta is out of control. Action is awful. Little to no Martial arts and just force pushing. Editing is atrocious, pulling from past clips, choppy action, no continuity through theme, just bad at a technical level and a story level.",Notr
625,"Well, here's another sequel no one asked for, but I went and saw it in the theater anyway because this is The matrix, the VHS cassette of which I watched like a hundred times, copied every line from, wore black sunglasses and loved with all my heart. The two sequels, I felt, were a little weaker but they nevertheless completed the trilogy and Neo's own story in the universe of the Matrix. But just like most of today back-from-the-dead movie franchises this one came back too - so, was it any good? Plenty.The matrix is built in the way that you can literally make the same movie with the same characters over and over again, then you reload it, revolutionize a bit and resurrect with a different name or a numeral. This one's no exception, it even mocks its own world half the time, and I love it when authors use self-irony as a creative tool, to the reasonable extent naturally. The matrix resurrections manages to be both a self-parody and a continuation, a new story and a remake, and in being both it loses the core of what the Matrix really is.It's great to see Keanu and Carrie-Anne back in their roles but I felt they were forced on them, as though the connection was lost and they tried to recreate the previous magic but I just couldn't feel it. The new characters on the other hand were way more alive and exciting, Neil Patrick Harris and Jonathan Groff both managed to fit in the roles left by another actors perfectly and bring them to a whole new level of greatness and outshone, in a way, lead characters.I'm also feeling the story isn't over yet, and we are facing yet another trilogy and I hope it gets better because after this one the only feeling I got was that it needs to change, and a lot. Watching a 2+ hour movie of filler talk and a to-be-continued story is hardly an exercise in brain breaking (the way the first three movies were) and I want to begin to believe again that there could be more to the universe I love.",Notr
626,"Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a successful game programmer whose trilogy of The Matrix video games earned him recognition and success, but despite this he is a depressed and isolated man who routinely sees an Analyst (Neil Patrick Harris) to discuss his fragile state. The high point of Thomas' days are his chance encounters with a married woman named Tiffany (Carrie-Anne Moss) whom despite never having met her he shares a connection. Thomas is under pressure from parent company Warner Bros. To deliver a new Matrix game despite him not wanting to, and his encounters with inane focus groups and marketing notes is beginning to wear on him. However when Thomas starts seeing Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) a supposedly fictional character from The Matrix games, the lines between real and unreal are blurred.The Matrix film series ended pretty definitively with the two parter films Reloaded and Revolutions back in 2003. The Wachowskis were routinely approached by Warner Bros. With questions about continuation and rumors had even circulated since 2011 regarding Warner Bros. Desires for continuation of the series and franchise. Eventually Lana Wachowski came up with a pitch that Warner Bros. Accepted (and according to Lana and dialogue in the movie itself Warner Bros. Would've made a sequel with or without them) and Warner Bros. Readily accepted the offer. Lilly Wachowski does not return along with Lana due to prior commitments on the Showtime series Work in Progress. While I do give the movie a recommendation, I completely understand why people wouldn't like it, but it's probably my second favorite Matrix after the first one.During the first hour of the movie, the film plays itself in a metatextual fashion similar to Wes Craven's New Nightmare where's it's a sequel while also blurring the lines between fiction and reality with elements bleeding into one another. Keanu Reeves performance is really strong as Thomas Anderson and its unquestionably the most human and relatable the role has been since the first film back in 1999. The romance between Thomas and Tiffany is also really well done and the fact that the movie isn't cramming in techno-babble suffocated exposition with long drawn out scenes of Navel-gazing makes the story much stronger and more resonant (for me anyway) on a character level than either Reloaded or Revolutions ever did. The first hour is definitely the best part of the movie where it plays with the audience's understanding of reality but once we reach the remaining 60% we're basically just another Matrix movie.Despite us traversing very familiar territory in the remaining 90 minutes I did enjoy seeing the advancements and divergences in the world since we left it twenty years ago. Some elements are interesting but aren't as fully developed as the could've been such as different factions of machines that are hostile and friendly, and there's a returning secondary character who's featured in some of the worst ""old person"" make-up I've seen since Guy Pearce in Prometheus. For me this part of the movie was okay. It had clear direction and an emotional core with the romance unquestionably the strongest it's been in any of these movies (and yes, I'm including the first one) and it's not overburdened with ancillary characters who were given more prominence in video games or direct to video animated projects that the movie expects you to already be familiar with.The Matrix Resurrections has many flaws and criticisms that I can see people pointing as their reason for disliking the film and I really can't fault them on it because they'd be perfectly valid. With that said, I enjoyed the movie overall and was entertained by the themes (even if in Wachowski fashion it's as subtle as a sledgehammer) and the returning performances of Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss as well as new performances such as Neil Patrick Harris, Jessica Henwick, and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. The movie doesn't reach the level of the first Matrix, but for my money it exceeds Reloaded and Revolutions.",Notr
627,"The only credit I will give this movie is that at least it doesn't do to Neo what Disney did to Luke in the Star Wars sequels. Other than that, the film is a dud. The costumes are weak. The sets are bad. The fights are boring. The new Agent Smith and Neil Patrick Harris are forgettable. It's not as bad as X-Men Three: The Last Stand, or Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, or the Star Wars prequels or sequels, but it's forgettable.",Notr

Begins with a bit of nostalgia for those fond of 1999's debut, but fails to go much further than that; nearly two decades have passed since the last entry, yet despite any technological advancements in that time the special effects are pretty mundane, and the fight scenes try (but fail) to replicate the earlier films as they lack tension or innovation. Much of the time Reeves looks like he should be elsewhere, he and Moss only have a shell of their former chemistry, and even worse: new casting in previously iconic roles along with multiple flashbacks warrant a shake of the head as to how vastly inferior this latest showing really is. A lot of talk and explanation, most of it just word salad, likely to convince fans that there was a valid reason to produce this disjointed sequel in the first place; just what was the goal here? *½",Notr
629,First - it's a tough act to follow - but they did a pretty good job with this! I enjoyed it! A good follow up and continuation of the story.

I wis it would have been a home run - but it was a base hit at best!,Notr

How are people controlled by marginalizing their faith, their ideas, their legends, their stories. What role does human connection play in giving people power and freedom of thought. Emotion is easier to manipulate than rational thought. The balance between hope and the pursuit of dreams vs. Being held back by the fear of losing what you have.So well done, and a wonderful continuation of the original story, and even adds to the depth of the original three.

And probably that is why it seemed like a letdown to me.The movie plays with The Matrix world but it lost all the charms it had 20 years ago.Even Keanu as Neo didn't has the same dynamic anymore.The movie did a bad job in every aspect whether it is direction, storyline, characters, cinematography, etc.The action sequences was decent at best.Matrix 2 was so amazing with action and now after 18 years this is the one thing in which they could do a really good job but it was so bad that it felt like watching a TV series rather than a movie in some scenes.New Morpheus was not serious but kinda like cranky. New agent smith was somewhat watchable also Neil did a good job as an antagonist who was not powerful.Plot was so loose that they didn't offer anything good to the story.Overall, it was not upto a good movie standard let alone considering it a Matrix part.Hope they don't repeat it ever again.",Notr

The supporting characters feel so fake, so out of place, the dialogue is full of slang pop culture language that doesn't make sense, it almost feels like a teenager wrote this. Neo feels truly stupid and clumsy instead of powerful and purposeful. I could really go on... worst matrix movie every, such a missed opportunity.",Notr
642,"If you are a true fan of the franchise, then you will love this film. It looks stunning, glossy, colourful and plays cleverly with the narrative of the original trilogy and it's place in the minds of the characters in this new Matrix.I'm glad I read the interview with Lana Wachowski explaining where this story came from and the reason she revisited this universe. Knowing her reasons allows you to experience the story differently, as a beautiful love story of characters that are so obviously important to her.I was also impressed/relieved with how the resurrections are explained - even though this is Sci-fi, it made sense and not too far-fetched. Very clever stitching of the bridge between the original 3 films and this new story. Nothing is erased or apologised for, which is awesome and full of integrity.Give it a chance.",Notr
643,"Almost 4 years after watching this movie, I want to figure it out.Yes, there's nothing better in the cinema at the end credits except: What is this...? It didn't come to mind.However, I don't seem to be so critical right now. Yes, the audience and the studio are openly mocked for being fools. The former, no, yes, brought money for such a Resurrection, and the latter lost it at this event. Yes, the hidden idea of the authors about pills is spoken out in plain text and looks just ridiculous. It's not a painting at all, but a complete joke.At the same time, there is probably a hope that something interesting will happen before the appearance of Morpheus, who is not Morpheus with an orange suit. And part of the final act tries to be action-packed, but otherwise it's just a mockery of the trilogy, which is either a continuation, but it doesn't bring anything new, ignoring the past, or a set of memories.I don't want to say anything about Neo's fights at all. As for this movie, parts of John Wick were released after that, so the portrayal of Keanu in this film as some kind of feeble grandfather who either acts as a punching bag or pushes everyone away with his mind looks just shameful.And with all this, let there be such a 4 part. You don't have to watch it, but sometimes you want something like that.",Notr

I get that they were playing on Neo being older, but man did he look like he was having a tough time in every fight scene... I feel like he was supposed to look this way or it could of been bad choreography... because in John Wick, Keanu never looks like he's having a bad go in a fight.The movie seemed really rushed as far as the story goes, like they had to throw something together really quick to get into production. Again it wasn't bad, but it felt super factory Hollywood.... Honestly I'd like to see a prequel movie on how the Matrix comes to be lol but obviously that movie can't be made because there would be no happy ending. Even a movie where the Matrix is actually brought down, I don't know something fresh... the same old ""we're in the Matrix"" bs can't go on.7 for the actors, I liked all the new people, especially Smith and Morpheus
5 for the story... obviously this wasn't written over the last 20 years, it probably took them a few months if that.10 for special effects, it's hard to mess this part up now a days.If it has a 5th installment, they need to get writers who have dreams and creativity.Also thank god they got rid of that stupid green tint that was used gracefully in the first movie, but washed over the second and third movies.",Notr

646,"How is it possible to be bored during a Matrix movie?Whilst it was great to see Neo & Trinity back on our screens, the overall impression is a jumbled mess with some questionable cinematography, lacklustre action and a heavy reliance on footage from the first three films. The first act drags and at 45 mins I realised I was bored. Things pick up a little in Act 2 before dipping massively as we are introduced to new characters, Technologies and the lazy script writing is exposed.Some of this could be excused if the film was somewhat fun or even have highlighted that which The Matrix was originally known for.....stunning and amazing combat. Just think back to the Subway scene in Matrix 1, the clear, defined combat between Neo & Agent Smith. How the tension was built, the significance of that moment, the comedy of when Agent Smiths glasses were broken and stunning combat - all had our jaws on the floor. Matrix 4 has instead regressed to cheap looking and ultimately very boring 'Jason Bourne' style of photography = shaky cameras, no real focus and unimaginative choreography (mainly because you can't see it). It took anything that was special and just stripped it out. A complete reversal from the first films and ultimately a fatal mistake.I cannot recommend this film - it will neatly fit into a number of lists that detail 'films that should never have been made'. There are moments of genius, but they are oh so fleeting. Ultimately very disappointing.",Notr
647,"This installment of Matrix is, so to say, under the weather, or, more accurately, in tone with the times we live in, for awhile.The characters are bored, older, and bearing the weight of the sense that nothing can make a change anymore. And this is just their life inside the Matrix... A lot of upset viewers compare it to the previous installments - why?! The first Matrix was a revelation, fit for its times... the second one just went deeper into the concept or the mindbending, however you want to call it, while the third both provided a resolution AND took part of its meaning away, making it a bitter victory. That, if you paid attention... Because ""the system only improves with each chosen one that fights the system"" is hardly an optimistic conclusion.Now we have something beyond that, and being an ""eyes wide open"" approach to the entire paradigm, it bears the seed of cynism, skepticism and disappointment. It is also satyrical in places, fuelling the debate whether this installment was forced or the authors wanted to do it, as well as the actors. Youth is far behind, for many involved in this project, people changed. A lot. Same for the viewers. I'm thinking the fans of the Matrix just don't want to confront unpleasant ideas, they expected an escapist 4th movie, in the way an ex rebel young rocker, now with a neat haircut, and being a middle manager in some irrellevant company wants not a loud concert and back pain from standing up in a crowd, but a romanced actualised rock song, to listen to it at home or in a cosy bar. As for the younger viewers, they are brought up in a world that already digested globally ideas like the ones from the initial Matrix movies, nothing new there, no revelation at face view, because the idea is part of the conceptual mix they already lived on, while growing up.So maybe this 4th Matrix has a target public issue. Or maybe it just threw in some quantum computing things that we cannot completely grasp, yet. It remains to be seen. However, most of the takedown comes from different expectations, to which the movie did not answer. And it is most likely a deliberate thing, they just ignored those expectations or went against them, because they wanted to show something else. What, more exactly?! I do not have a clear answer. Put with the other movies, it seems to convey the idea that awakening is not a set thing, nor is it just one big break - more like, after each effort of opening your eyes, one discovers yet another layer of deception. Yet, one has to go on fighting for the existential truth. Why, again? Because this is what it means to be human. Although humans are so tired, this movie says... and almost drifting away from their defining traits and their big existential fight. Only that some awakening triggers have been placed by themselves here and there, to help them get through this flat part of the curve in the process of finding out who we are and what are we meant to do. Something like this...",Notr

649,"The Matrix Resurrections was an extremely frustrating, boring, bland and even generic action movie. It somehow lost everything that made The Matrix so special, and in my opinion doesn't even live up to the sequels. Its so peculiar to experience; it has moments that are quite interesting but ultimately bogged down by being in a terrible movie. Where The Matrix had revolutionary action and philosophical undertones, this had none of that. The action was quite lacklustre, some of it was okay but none of it was worthy of the Matrix name. It even felt quite mindless, it didn't have any real philosophical questions to ponder in it; just felt like a jumble of ideas thrown onto the screen. It quite literally made me laugh and roll my eyes multiple times (when I wasn't supposed to), and even had the audacity to retcon and revise the original movies, to the point it didn't even feel like they mattered. It felt somewhat like ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" in how it really betrayed the movies that came before it. I felt like there was potential at the start but as it went along it got progressively worse. The trailer is truly the best way to experience this movie.This really did feel like it was a reluctant sequel. You can tell through the meta commentary this movie has (and there is a lot of it) that Lana Wachowski did not want to make this movie. There is lots of dialogue about how no one wants to return to the Matrix, and strong commentary that really attacks the culture of Hollywood studios' over-reliance on reboots and sequels. There's even a line about how the studio will make a 4th Matrix with or without Thomas Anderson, which is exactly what WB did to Lana Wachowski. It felt like a bit of a middle finger to Hollywood; accepting the job and making this very mediocre at best movie with meta commentary attacking them. I enjoyed the meta pieces of the film and thought they were quite clever, but I will admit they took me out of the film at many points. It also led to moments that felt cheapened by nostalgia or meta narrative, such as the use of footage from the original films. It was such a mistake to intercut this footage as it was jarring to the point of stupidity and even made new cast members really seem terrible.I actually really liked Neil Patrick Harris and Jonathan Groff in the film! They were definitely miscast but I still felt they popped where the others didn't. Neil Patrick Harris was just so much fun to watch onscreen, and while Groff does a terrible Hugo Weaving impression, he is pretty good when he does his own thing and really sells the connection between Neo and Smith where Weaving didn't. Yahya Abdul-Mateen was fine as new Morpheus, but he can't compare to Lawrence Fishburne who I really missed. It was interesting what they tried to do with the character, but it really didn't work for me. It was nice to see Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne-Moss in their classic roles, but it doesn't feel like they had anything new to offer here. Carrie Anne-Moss was also barely in the movie, but did have a great monologue. Neil Patrick Harris also had a good one too, in one of my favourite moments in the movie.Aside from these interesting monologues the dialogue felt like it was written by a five year old. Same goes for the story. It has some good ideas but they just never went anywhere with it. The movie tried for high concept without bothering to layer in logic. I did like what they did with Neo at the start of the movie, but it just completely revised what the end of the 3rd film meant. This movie also had much lower stakes and just didn't feel as interesting, it was more about the relationship between Neo and Trinity rather than saving humanity; it doesn't play like the 4th film in a franchise. There also seemed to be so many WTF moments where it was hard to tell why/what was happening, especially in the last 30 minutes. It also didn't feel like much happened in the film overall.This movie just felt cheap. It didn't feel like a Matrix movie to me and was even visually boring. There were a few cool shots but nothing like in the first movie. It really had nothing new to offer, and felt like a rehash of the first at best. The most interesting parts were the meta narrative, but ultimately the movie is nothing special. I didn't hate it, there were some good moments, but they just didn't amount to anything good; I just didn't like it as a whole, but really liked some scenes. It just wasn't good. If you like the Matrix sequels I'd check it out, but it is quite disappointing when compared to the groundbreaking original film and feels so disconnected with what made it special. I've heard some people think its great though... so maybe you'll like it! It just wasn't for me.",Notr

654,"""The Matrix Resurrections"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie and the fourth movie of the ""The Matrix"" franchise, in which we watch the two realities come together and Mr. Anderson needs to find and follow the correct one.Since I had already watched the trilogy, I knew the story behind it but I did not know what to expect from this fourth movie. After watching it I understand why a lot of people were disappointed by it and the main reason was that they expected too much. The plot was for one more time interesting and it was really nice watching again some of the main characters. The interpretations of Keanu Reeves who played as Neo, Carrie-Anne Moss who played as Trinity, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who played as Morpheus and Jessica Henwick who played as Bugs were very good. In conclusion, I have to say that ""The Matrix Resurrections"" is a nice movie but if you have high expectations I am sure you will be disappointed.",Notr

Simple evolution in the matrix design would have given this promising franchise, the reboot it needed.. Reloaded had a refreshing enhancement but went downwards on revolutions due to unnecessary dragging of storyline.. When a director realizes these simple editing or redundant storyline mistakes, it's really these small changes can revitalize and add the needed suspense or thrill that the movie needs.. the matrix has a powerful & flexible storyline that can be bent towards a more close to reality storyline, simply by adding new tech that can redefine and envision what a real 18 years of matrix evolution can offer that can show how matrix can work in the real world scenario as to explain how we have already integrated ourselves to that system which helped us evolve as higher beings with much better relationship with the machines. Sorry to say there was mostly reminiscing and not much of the expected thrill that matrix system evolution could have shown how that 18yrs in the matrix world can show atleast 30yrs of enhanced way of integration and living.. maybe la king 1 of the wachowski was a bad move.. so sad..",Notr

My biggest fear for it going in was the same fear I have for any reboot/long delayed sequel. I feared it wasn't gonna feel like the original Matrix. Or that it would be the same and outdated. It turns out it was neither. This film does something truly rare. It stays faithful to the original while simultaneously evolving it. It's so meta, to the point where it borders parody. But it all serves a purpose. Lana Wachowski (the director) understands exactly what she needed to do here. She understands that this movie was almost certainly doomed to fail. She used that and turned it into the main plot line of the movie! It's one of the most unique storylines I have ever seen. Up until the third act I was almost ready to call this the best matrix movie. Unfortunately it gets a little too silly for me at the end. All things considered this was a triumph. Although I have a feeling a lot of people will hate this movie. It's different, and it's not afraid to show it. It's goofy, and the action isn't as good as it was in the OG trilogy.

I was a big fan of the three other movies, rated them with a nine, eight and another nine stars, so you could say that I was thrilled when I heard there would be another one. Once again I think people are exaggerating with their one, two and three stars ratings. It's certainly not that bad, but I agree that it could have been much better. The story is difficult to follow, makes no sense sometimes, but the other three movies were not easy to follow either. All in all this one is a disappointment. I expected something much better, certainly when you know what they're capable to do now, twenty years later, when the technology took another big leap. The cast should have been the same as the previous ones, so that was also not the greatest move. The ones that were present in this one are not bad playing their characters but they for sure lack the style they had in the previous movies. The fight scenes were also not that impressive. The good thing was that there is still that Gigeresque scenery which made all the movies look brilliant. The Matrix Resurrections is for sure the weakest of all four, I would probably have rated with a six instead of a seven if I wasn't such a big fan of the previous ones.",Notr

665,"This fourth film in the franchise is a bold reboot, precisely because the producers decided to abandon the old formula and baseline plot, and go for something different. In that decision is both the appeal of this movie but also the source of disappointment among so many who loved the original trilogy.How can conflict arise from the declared peace that ended the third installment? Unless the people foolishly decide to break that peace despite the hopeless odds against them, or the machines do what the logical construct disallows, and lie, any plot about a renewal of the same machine vs people war loses credibility.So, the movie's conflict has to be rooted in a different structure, a different focus and origin. And this is the new path this reboot decided upon.Call this review one that appreciated the bold effort, while properly seeing the production qualities and special effects remain top notch.Does the rebooted narrative strike the right chord throughout? No, there are times the movie bogs down in its own efforts. Thirty minutes could have been trimmed off the final edit and the plot suffering none for it. Or, the half hour used to flesh out more original points, or invoke more original characters and their actions.Then there is the new take on ""smart bombs"" near the end of the movie, which seems perhaps a desperate reach to forge a message, that seems entirely lost in its translation.The movie scores an A for effort and originality, but a C for narrative. It doesn't appear as good as it could have been, as if the producers ran out of steam and decided to go with what they had.In the end, it's a much better than average movie, but it certainly isn't the instant classic that most people would have expected and certainly wanted.",Notr

There were a few very corny friendly robots but overall I had fun watching the film despite it not feeling as deep as the first one.Visually it was filmed with excellent CGI that wasn't distracting or overly gimmicky. I liked that it kind of broke the fourth wall a bit at the start.The side characters were mostly decent (other than just one or maybe two that could have been darker / grittier).There's definitely a LOT of messaging from the sisters around gender, identity and transformation which is more on the the nose / accessible than in the first films.There was a disappointing cover of a great track from the first film which harshed my vibe a bit it didn't have the same effect.The first half of the film felt a bit deeper than the second half.It felt in general it's probably on par with the second film in a different way.

670,"As a long-time fan of the Matrix franchise, ""The Matrix Resurrections"" came as an unexpected Christmas gift from Lana Wachowski, for which I will always be grateful.It's sad to see reviews from people claiming to be Matrix fanatics and then proceeding to bash this film just because it's not what they believe the Matrix is. It makes me wonder if that's the same people the film itself makes fun of, all those believing that the Matrix is about bullet-time, lots of guns and kung-fu. No wonder they all feel called out.There is a line that says ""they took your (Neo's) story, something that meant so much to people like me, and turned it into something trivial"" and that line hit hard. Lana Wachowski boldly proceeds to take apart the trilogy's aesthetic to reveal that beneath the green filter and sublime action, the motivating power has always been love. Neo spends days and days in an office, listening to people talk about what the Matrix is and what everybody thinks when they hear of it, while his mind is focused on one thing only: Trinity. It's an interesting montage that, in true Matrix form, you don't necessarily get during your first watch. It reveals what has always been the force beneath the powers of the One. It reveals that Neo never became the One just because he was, but he became the One because Trinity believed in him.In parallel form, the film shows us how Neo's belief in Trinity awoke her own powers as part of the One. And ultimately, while it closes with the unfortunate observation that we, the ""sheeple"", will never pursue freedom because of how dependent we now are from technology and machinery, ""The Matrix Resurrections"" reminds us what a free mind and love can do: they can make us fly away and build a better world.It's a wonderfully meta film, it's a wonderful love story, it brought back so many memories and hit us with nostalgia, it has exceptional imagery and fantastic performances... If I could give it a 20 out of 10 I would. Give it a chance before you let yourself be influenced by the words of haters. This film might as well change your world.",Notr

We are now left with more questions and probably won't get more movies after this to explain them. Hopefully we do, and hopefully they are better.

There is a moment in this movie where a helicopter disappears completely for like 2-4 min, only to return right where it should have been all the time, so it again can shoot at the main actors, it made no sense but someone must have forgot it was there from the start.Like I said this is more like a spoof movie of the Matrix, it really has no connection that makes sense to the old movies, and the story isn't moved forward in any meaningful way.

684,"The Matrix Resurrections was an unneeded addition to the legendary Matrix series. Many people agreed that the third installment of the series was not up to par with the standards set in place by the first two, yet the fourth one is even more underwhelming.To begin, the film put messages out in a very direct manner such as ""face zuck"" which tied the film to extremely recent events and thus made it lose its novelty. It did not allowing the viewer to comprehend any hidden meanings as they are so blatantly portrayed. Apart from that, these messages do not tie in with the plot progression and they seem so out of place. The antithesis between this film which tries to become a critic of political happenings and the originals which immersed themselves deeply into the story is shocking.Despite one's assumption that graphics and film editing should have become even more advanced, the colors were not even close to the original which had underlying greens and blues that gave the scene a deeper element. Additionally, the effects that made the originals so popular (namely the slow motion movements) seemed worse in this film than in those released decades ago.I feel as though the Wachowskis should work on a new series instead of changing the legacy of The Matrix by bringing it into the 2020s.Additionally, having new actors for established characters (like Morpheus and Agent Smith) lost the flair of the original (though I know certain actors like Hugo Weaving were not available).The implementation of a video game inside The Matrix to explain the history of Neo and Trinity was an odd approach which I personally didn't appreciate. I understand what it was meant to do (explain the memories they may have and keep them close to the matrix by having Neo work on the video game), yet I feel as though it loses the ingenuity of the original films that did not rely on external or cultural elements to explain their respective plots. Additionally, I think it binds The Matrix storyline to the late 20th and early 21st century which I personally find a little disappointing as The Matrix was originally made in a way that was ambiguous, so as to apply to many different decades.Next, I feel as though Lana Wachowski decided to take a superhero approach to the ending. I found myself cringing when Trinity and Neo fly off during the last seen, I don't know who thought it was a good idea. It really saddens me to see a monumental series turn into a superhero movie that has lost touch with its roots.",Notr

Easy money I guess.This is a movie that probably had a big budget, but plays like a low budget movie. Low quality cast, story, plot and script. Disappointing fight choreography to match. The entire movie was a confusing contradiction.

I can't understand why Reeves was in this film.

It lasts until the end of the movie, leaving plot holes that shouldn't have been there in the first place.I cannot blame actors, albeit I've expected more action from Keanu, but I guess age puts its limits. New actors, including Morpheus, are good enough.Overall, it all boils down to a story. A story what has happened to humans after Matrix 3.

To an extent.The action sequences pale in comparison to the highs of the earlier films, although there are some very cool moments. The story is also perhaps a little looser, but the rest is all there.I loved all of the meta references and on the whole I thought the plot was solid, really doubling down on the love story to great effect.There's a lot unwarranted hate out there for this film and I'm not sure why.

And while the film try to shake things up in changing some of the mythology of the series, that made the originals so great, and inventive, and much thankful to the amazing first film, this film is in a pretty impossible task to match that kind of level, and I can give credit of trying to adopt new layers of elements within the franchise. Does it all work? No. Does it all fail? Also no.Its harder to digest since the changes they made, and new characters and subplot, but in the end its very much of the same. Its if there are changes, but not actual ones. Just different names and ""skins"" to much of the same.But this was very much a Neo's film and journey of a self rediscovery.Yeah, it feels underwhelming to the original three, which were big bombastic scifi philosophical action films, that reinvented the genre, and questioned social constructs as we know it, and all had something new to add, a stylish action packed that had a great combo of entertainment and much thought behind them. But, I understood some of the direction they took. With much, Much, slower burn than the originals.It feels much less climatic, smaller scaled, but more personal, and self aware story, to a point of mocking itself, and its motives, at some points during the film.Yes, It should have been better, it should have had more soul, and love put into it, it should have respected more the lore of the originals, cinematography, score, atmosphere, feeling and characters, and should have been made in times Hollywood was here to tell stories, and not pander its audiences with identity politics and gaslight their ideologies in every film, (Merv was totally right with his criticism), but this film is not much in fault of being a product of it's time, and still In times that much of most major franchises are being compromised, and in trying to fix past ""mistakes"" (poor sequels/prequels/reboots/remakes/spinoffs).We are entering an era of fan service, after the recent years pushed much of its audience away, and while some did a great job in fixing it, and uniting old and new fans (Spider-Man No Way Home, Dune, The Suicide Squad, Snyder's JL and Ghostbusters: Afterlife), most still in the process of going back to their roots in focusing on telling a great compelling story. And there's still hope for many of those.Will time will help to the advantage of the film to be better and have a better outlook? We'll have to wait and find out. But take it for what it is.

The first film in 1999 is a groundbreaking modern classic, brilliant in all ways, and all the more essential for the easily discerned allegory confirmed by the filmmakers of the experience of coming out as transgender. Its 2003 sequels, 'Reloaded' and 'Revolutions,' were enjoyable as they completed a storytelling trilogy, but were neither perfect nor fully satisfying and distinctly paled in comparison to what probably should have been a standalone title. Even the stated earnest and heartbreaking intent of Lana Wachowski for revisiting the franchise couldn't wholly assuage my doubts, for one had to wonder where the story could possibly go following the end of the trilogy in 2003 - and while the first trailer caught my attention, I realized later that this was mostly due to the grabbing use of Jefferson Airplane's ""White rabbit.""And, well, then one sits to watch. The first impressions that 'Resurrections' makes is that it's direly heavy-handed, agonizingly reliant on references to the preceding movies, and even more excruciatingly meta and self-referential. Not one half-hour has elapsed, with two hours left, and the first impression that this makes is that it's almost unwatchable, and nearly self-parodying; ""tragedy or farce,"" indeed. From the get-go the feature boasts outstanding production values, certainly, but in other ways that are at least as important it's a terrible start, and one can only hope that the installment will improve as the length draws on. In fairness, it does. Deep within the expansive quagmire that this creates for itself are terrific ideas that do meaningfully play with questions of past and present, reality and falsehood, and deliberate dalliance with boundaries of the franchise's own universe as a foundation for another journey into the matrix and ""the real world"" beyond that construct. Would that the path to get there wasn't the cinematic equivalent of, if you will, a pulp adventurer stepping onto the wrong stone in an ancient trap and nearly falling to his death - and that such pitfalls didn't continue to trouble the proceedings - but there is, after all, value herein.One must give credit where it is due, and there is a great deal to admire here. As one might well expect, the visuals are a veritable wonderland, in every capacity. It goes without saying that digital wizardry is the primary order of the day, but it all looks as fantastic as modern CGI can. The production design and art direction are plainly magnificent; insofar as there are tangible set pieces on hand, they're lovely. The costume design is a sight for sore eyes, and the hair and makeup artists had their work cut out for them but hit a home run. The props and weapons are fabulously imaginative - and for that matter, the fundamental design of every visual element is phenomenal, flush with stupendous detail. While obviously hearkening back to established lore and settings, every machine, environment, background, special effect, and action sequence is frankly dazzling. The action sequences are sharp, fast-paced, and invigorating. It's another star-studded, stunning cast that was assembled here, in addition to Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, and I sincerely believe that they all give strong performances that are an unlikely point of stability amidst all else (though some instances are plainly overdone, by unfavorable conscious choice). Wachowski's direction is similarly solid, as is the editing and cinematography that help to shape the whole. While Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer's score is perhaps not remarkable in and of itself, I have no specific criticisms to impart, and it ably lends to the mood and overall tenor at any given time; the sound effects and sound design are swell.And now we look again to the screenplay whipped up between Wachowski, David Mitchell, and Aleksandar Hemon. It very much bears repeating that it's an aggravatingly rough ride to get to that part of the picture that shows its worth, and the unsavory flavors continue to be garnishes throughout. Beyond this, a compelling, entertaining, satisfying story is woven, with superb scene writing, spectacular ideas for beats and action sequences alike, important themes broached in passing, and fairly robust character writing. For the most part I'm glad to say that I was mistaken, and Wachowski and her collaborators did indeed find a way to revisit the universe twenty years after the iconic trilogy. This is not, however, to say that 'Resurrections' is perfect even at its best, because there are other issues that peek through. Some scene writing also relies so heavily on past ideas - chiefly, the powers that Neo previously demonstrated - that the further inclusions become overbearing and tiresome. Well done and exciting as the last half-hour is, part of me thinks it's also unnecessary in at least some measure, and the feature is longer than it needs to be. Beyond the tawdry exposition, the narrative is also curiously simple and straightforward, and convolutions laid into the storytelling feel a bit empty. This is to say nothing of how that narrative is also gawkily club-footed at many points, blunt and lacking nuance, if not also painfully on the nose and reflective of what is emotionally pleasing rather than what is judicious and mindful from the standpoint of plot. To the latter, point, I'm sad to say I include what the antagonist reveals of Neo and Trinity's relationship, a linchpin of much of the film, and the entirety of the last scene, down to the cover of a song that's not so much a nod as it is the slamming of one's head against a wall.What it comes down to is that 'The matrix resurrections' is exactly as well made as one would assume, and the crux of the matter is the writing. As much as I recognize Wachowski's drive in moving forward with this, I don't personally see it meaningfully come across in the finished product. There are aspects of the writing, ones I've already belabored, that feel downright self-indulgent; as if to illustrate the point, a post-credits scene is mildly amusing in and of itself, but 100% pointless and it never should have even been filmed. This movie was in critical need of a more delicate, subtle, careful, attentive, thoughtful approach; for as long as the title may have been gestating before production began, it surely needed longer still, and maybe more cooks in the kitchen, so that the rough patches could have been smoothed out. And I say this as someone who does, actually, like the end result. I didn't think I would, I had deep reservations from long before I saw it, and still for all its flaws I think it's more worthwhile than not. Yet for as troubled as the film is, any possible recommendation doesn't so much come with an caveat as it does an appendix. There are too many issues here to mark this as an easy suggestion for anyone except diehard fans of the antecedents, of Wachowski and her sister, or of the cast. Otherwise, I think it's the curious and open-minded cinephile who will get the most out of 'Resurrections,' the type of viewer who will watch genuinely anything and who delights in assessment, dissection, and discussion. For general audiences - well, personal preferences will vary, and the best I can say is ""proceed with caution."" I like it, but I can understand all too well why it met with such a modest reception in 2021, and I can begrudge no one who thinks less of it. I'm of the opinion that 'The matrix resurrections' is, after all, a commendable addition to the franchise, but only after we sit and talk it out for a long, long time. Take that as you will.",Notr

702,"It was ok. I watched the original trilogy leading up to seeing Resurrections. Maybe that was a mistake. The first thing I notice was how the quality seemed lower...which should be impossible with how much newer the technology is. I have my suspicions as to why they would allow us to feel that way in the opening sequence. But without knowing their motivation, I was left underwhelmed and actively thinking how this felt cheap.The story is alright, nothing special. There are a few familiar faces. But I never felt a connection to the new ones. For such a long movie, it felt lacking in storytelling, which shouldn't be possible.If they make another one, I'll probably watch it. But this movie either didn't need to be made or needed more time cooking. I do wonder if missing one-half of the original visionaries meant we also lost half of the vision and creativity.",Notr

They make films so procedurally nowadays, their is no creativity. The young actors of course sucked as usual these days. The visuals weren't even as good as the first movie. The story, as usual nowadays, it made absolutely no sense and didn't even add up. A lot of this film didn't even mesh together. This film has so much left leaning political agendas to it, the casting makes that clear and I think maybe this film was supposed to be a comedy? Idk, idk what I watched, it wasn't the matrix but I'm not surprised it's junk, that is all our current generation produces.

708,"Before watching matrix resurrection, I rewatched the original trilogy that was game changing and highly entertainment.Going into this movie I didn't expect it to be better then the original, but at lest it would try to be as good as the sequels. But sadly it wasn't.There some stuff to appreciate from this movie like some of the action scenes were entertaining but not close to the first two. Some of the new characters are kinda likable like Jessica Henwick character, she was entertaining but her hair color choice is really out of the place. Yahya as morphes was a great choice to replace Laurence Fishburne. He was very entertaining and fun to watch however, I still prefer Laurence. Neo character wasn't destroyed and that was surprising! Carrie Moss return as Trinity was a great comeback but it was wasted. She deserved more screen time then what she got.The major drawback to this movie was the script and the direction. This movie had ZERO style or charisma and felt like a nostalgia fest! The wachoeski's had proven themselves that they can make great films. Just like the first trilogy. In the first trilogy the movies had a style and PASSION which is totally missing in resurrection. There is zero effort on putting something new or stylish but rather going on lazy! The flashbacks where so annoying and unnecessary. What's the point of showing this much of flashbacks from the previous films? To remind us how they were good? We already know that. FOCUS ON THE NEW ONE.I wouldn't unrecommended this movie. But don't expect to much and just expect some good action scenes! Overall I'll give it 5.5/10.",Notr

I would've preferred a CGi version of Mr. Fishburne instead. Either you're going to love or hate the new Matrix. I choose the latter for various reasons. Heck I think it would've made a better video game than movie.

Why this movie is SO great because it is not even fantasy anymore, it is directly about day to day lie. It all rings completely true, from how the Matrix has evolved on screen from just being a theory, to actually practically showing how it controls people. This would be like Minority Report that the update is not just 'psychic people know you'll murder' but that all the surveillance can pinpoint who is about to murder through actual data analysis down to your temperature. Science fiction has shown us avenues all this becomes real. The idea of futuristic Gen Z people who have nothing going for them so go to rescue Neo, is so on point. It is like how all the young kids now still listen to all that dadrock or watch those old movies, because nothing is there for them. They are just hungry for life, for meaning, in a post-collapse system. The movie it is just 'right'. The first movie predicted the world we would live in, and this movie shows us what living inside of it is like.",Notr

714,This movie is only mildly entertaining if you're interested in seeing how truly lame this cash grab of a movie is.Poor set design. The movie looks like it was filmed on a 1940s movie lot. Not a lot effort made into the props and scenery. Especially in the urban settings. The urban areas do not feel gritty. Too clean. Comes of as unnatural. And that does not enhance or drive the story. The set design actually disappoints.The story I could not grasp. All i know it did not have the power of the first movie. The first movie felt like a veil of deceit was being lifted from my eyes. This movie has no message other than to twist its over arching narrative askew.Acting was dull. Like watching tree bark grow. Wooden delivery. Lame lines. Too bad they changed out morpheus for another actor. I could not buy in. No matter how they tried to spin it.The action was okay. But not important. You never feel under duress. You always know the good guys are going to win. Also the agents are dumbed down and nerfed. You can't even tell the agents from there disguised form apart.Overall this movie feels like a cash grab just trying to capitalize off the original's magic. But there's no substance at all here.,Notr
715,"To be honest, my expectations weren't high. Revivals after two decades almost never fair well. This film spends a lot of time displaying flashbacks of the original trilogy scenes to earn brownie points with OG fans, but this new installment doesn't bring anything new to the table as far as science fiction is concern. It just reiterates the original story with an added gaming/programmer side story of which there are countless on Netflix. They even rehash some of the original special effects again into this film.This installment turns into a romance between Neo and Trinity where Neo tries to recapture a lost love. Probably the only good thing about the film was some of the martial arts fighting between Neo and Morpheus. But that's not enough to make this film worth rewatching.The film is a letdown. And producers, let Keanu Reeves get some much-needed sleep. He looked like he was half asleep in all of his scenes.",Notr
716,"The film spends a solid first half of it's runtime commentating on the state of filmmaking, studios, reboots and franchises in which it becomes increasingly apparent that it's just Lana Wachowski using the film as a mouthpiece to bitch to the audience that she didn't want to make the film and the studio forced her to do it. Which is fine but people don't come to watch a Matrix film for a commentary on the state of Hollywood, there are plenty of other films that do that better. The original Matrix appealed to people because of it's exploration of themes such as AI, technology, man vs machine, existentialism, fate, free will, choice etc. Heck over the years as the directors themselves have come out as trans, the Matrix has slowly come to be seen as a form of trans allegory but the new film other than a throwaway line does absolutely nothing with it.Unfortunately the first half is also where she puts the most effort as that's the part she was really interested in, because the 2nd half just feels like a rushed hodge podge of a romance/rescue plot where it seems like the director just realized ""Oh yeah I've still got an entire movie to finish"". The main theme here seems to be that of love but the 2nd half is so rushed that all of Neo/Trinity's development just feels unearned. The film could have definitely used an extra half an hour or more to make their developments more fleshed out.It also doesn't help that the action is also very unremarkable which the the sequels at least excelled in.",Notr

718,"I'm not shocked by the bad reviews on here. Transcendental stories rarely appeal to the masses, the sheeple. My advice is, watch the film and judge for yourself. Keeping in mind this a sequel to a series that began in 1999. The world has changed greatly since. Lana volunteered to direct this film because WB was going to go through with the project with or without her. And she took the opportunity to not sell out, and told a story that could only make sense if you're actually paying attention to the dialogue. So on that note, I do recommend watching it at home, so you can rewind and replay some scenes, maybe with close captions on. Or give it a second watch. My friend who saw it at the theater, was left feeling a little confused because some of the dialogue goes a bit too fast to grasp the whole message in one sitting. So they had to give it a second watch.I must end my review for now with a pretty solid observation by Derek Robertson I came across about this film today: ""The new one is a sophisticated self-critique of the culture that swallowed it"" -- as in the first film's message.",Notr
719,"I don't want to spoil the movie, so I will try to stay as generic as possible and to avoid talking about the plot. Well... there isn't much of a plot to talk about, to be honest.Compared to the mystical ""The Matrix"" and the epic war movie sequels (2 and 3), this movie contains what could have been a side-quest for the characters in a previous instalment of the franchise. Rather than a new movie, Resurrections feels like a cut-out scene from another movie, watered down to reach the desired length.Characters are quite shallow, the way in which they are introduced, or reintroduced, into the story seems lazy at best. Acting, aside from a few main characters, is average.I admit that my expectations were so low that I found the movie almost watchable, still not particularly good. I give it 6 stars because it would make a decent afternoon past-time as an episode on Netflix, but I am quite happy that I didn't have to pay a cinema ticket to watch it in the first place.There is so much more that could be done with the concept in The Matrix, some has even been lightly attempted at the beginning of this movie, but Resurrections really fails at resurrecting the franchise on the big screen.",Notr

Each dialogue. The movie reminds you of some of the parts before, and frankly, they presented the dialogues in a smooth and enjoyable way and praised the element The evil in the film, which was presented to us by Neil Patrick, which was surprisingly good, but I did not like the speed in the transition between events. I felt that everything happened quickly and also I did not like the story of the film, which was bad looking at the season's before, but the film is good and deserves to be watched strongly, but before watching it, you should watch the parts that came before to remember the events.",Notr

I found myself rewinding to see if I missed something multiple times - but no I hadn't missed anything. The transitions between scenes and the editing in general is just bad.Also, WB needs to stop promoting themselves in everything they do (Space Jam 2). Only Disney is allowed to do that - WB is no Disney. Which to me is just another sign that their franchises need to die.In the end it is a decent flick with some good performances and an alright story...But...THE MATRIX is not properly RELOADED, it is not a REVOLUTION and has not had any RESURRECTIONS.

Seemingly the idea is Neo and Trinity were trying to be kept apart at all costs because their connection always disrupted the programming of the matrix- at least this is how I perceive it.The film tries to do a lot in a short period of time and I just don't think it was as ground breaking or entertaining as its predecessors. At the same token it wasn't a complete waste of time. I'm probably not going to watch it again and it won't hurt if you wait until this is available on dvd or to stream online.

It has a story to tell, and its repetition isn't as bad the Star Wars rehashes, because repetition is part of the story of The Matrix.It has flaws, but not too many.

The part I personally found insulting was the constant use of actual footage from the first 3 films as if they thought the audience needed a constant reminder of what had already happened. It is clear that either Lana Wachowski has completely lost the plot, or that this film was intentionally sabotaged to serve as a satire of reboots. It is clear that there's bad blood between Lana Wachowski and Warner Brothers, as it is quite literally stated in the film that they were forced to make another sequel whether they wanted to or not.",Notr

The you know there's something but you can't put your finger on it thing (""You don't know what it is, but it's there"" from Matrix 1). This, they did quite well in the first half of the movie, and Keanu played it well again, reason why to me it's 6/10 (otherwise it's more of a 4-5/10).On the down side, mirroring Matrix 1 inevitable repeated the same mistakes (and made them worse). Just like in Matrix 1, the genuine intuition ends with its own mere ""predefinition"". Just like then, the authors didn't seem to know what to do with it, so it got explained by means of a repressive enemy and transposed into a bang-bang love-punk driven story with meaningless conclusions. Only worse, because after a decent first half with holding the bombastic, Matrix 2-3 like empty-shell action scenes at bay, which is after some carefully giving dialogues even more thought than in Matrix 1 and trying to keep away from clichés, the nakedness of the emperor strikes quite unpleasantly and a warmed-over slop is unleashed. Oh, you will have to endure human-bombs jumping through windows and a good amount of blatant attempts to create some sort of high-stakes in a noir atmosphere... with an empty romantic conclusion, used again as an acceptable goal in the absence of one to match (and truly follow) the premise. There are books out there (like Paradigm Shift, Stk Chan) that make better use of such a genuine premise.Overall, a watchable movie where newcomers may yawn in the end trying to compare it to other more recent action movies, while Matrix veterans may find themselves FFW-ing in a sort of acknowledgment that there's nothing more to it than the otherwise interesting/exciting idea back in 1999.",Notr

Whether it's the budget, or the missing Wachowski, or something else, there are flashes of what could've been a really good movie, but part of the magic is gone. Or, perhaps I set the bar too high?

740,"Before watching Matrix Resurrections, I watched Matrix, Matrix Reloaded, and Matrix Revolutions. I also reread Plato's Allegory of the Cave and commentary about knowing if we were shadow followers or not.I watched Matrix Resurrections with an open mind and paid more attention to the dialogue. I enjoyed the action and the special effects as well. As I watch, major themes of truth, reality choice, peace, and love played out. The questions posed throughout the movie will always be asked. ""What are you looking for?"" ""What do you want?"" ""Who are you?""Matrix Resurrections provides answers to questions raised in the earlier movies and raises new questions.In order to keep balance and harmony in the world we need to be engaged in dialogue with each other learning what reality is, what truth is, what peace is, and what love is.Matrix Resurrections provides a framework for us.",Notr
741,"I read a bunch of negative reviews but as a huge matrix fan I thought I should at least give Resurrections a chance and watch it at the cinemas. I don't think it's as bad as some of the reviews I've read but it's also the worst of the 4.Just to put this in context I LOVE the matrix. To this day Matrix 1 is my fav movie ever and unlike some I really enjoyed the last 2.The problem with Resurrections is it just tries too hard to be a parody of itself. Almost felt like a fan made movie that wanted to bring back the nostalgia of the original but failed at doing so. There are so many scenes that are basically clones of the original it's tiring. Then worse than that are the constant flashbacks of the original trilogy. If I said there was literally 5 minutes of scenes from the matrix I wouldn't be exaggerating. Almost felt like every 10 minutes they needed to show a flashback. It got tiring like watching a simpsons rerun episode.Add to that the length of the movie 2.5 hours was just too dang long. The lack of substance in the story didn't justify the length and had me feeling restless by the end.The characters were all pretty forgettable, even the new morpheus didn't really have an important role. The most interesting scenes were with Jessica Henwick (blue haired chick) she's an amazing martial artist and added some cool special effects moments. Unfortunately most of the cool scenes you will see are in the trailer, since there really isn't much action in this movie.My biggest issue though is it all just felt like a weaker watered down version of the matrix. Even Neo always felt like Neo 0.5 not the god level Neo we are used to. That I think is it's biggest let down. How do go from full all out world ending action scenes to this? Once you've driven 200ks an hour 80kms feels slow.Too slow, not enough action. Hardly any kung fu. Weak characters. Pointless no direction story. Couple of good actions scenes. That unfortunately is the new Matrix.",Notr

So one sits watching lugubrious soul-searching, melodramatically sentimental ""the power of love"" scenes, punctuated by busy SPFX and action scenes that are so typical of the public's acquiescence in recent decades to mindless superhero/comic strip fantasy and violent visuals.",Notr

I think going in with lowered expectations helped.I saw a review that said if felt like cheap tv and that is correct, most of the cinematography lends to a feel that they had to go the cheap route, dark lighting, the fight scenes lack a certain sharpness. Think what it looks like to watch a soap opera vs seeing something on the big screen. The production is way different.Without giving anything away, I think they did a good job explaining how and why there is another Matrix movie and how and why the characters are where they are. It did feel rushed at times, there is not much character development. I think if you haven't seen the previous movies this one won't make much sense as nothing is really explained in great detail.I would definitely say this is the weakest of the 4 movies but still feels like it belongs in the universe.

Lana Wachowski delivers a surprisingly meta, self-aware movie about the original trilogy packed with bold, fascinating ideas but an absolutely terrible execution.From the dreadfully unfunny, cringe-worthy brainstorming sessions about the previous films to the heavy-handed, headache-inducing exposition, the director constantly tries to tell the viewers how incredible the original trilogy is, forgetting to create a compelling, captivating story for this new installment.The gorgeous visuals and impactful score aren't good enough to elevate the shockingly average, choppy action sequences. Despite remarkable performances from Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, and the standout Jessica Henwick, Resurrections just didn't work for me.If you're a fan of the franchise, I obviously recommend watching it. Just be aware that this isn't a new The Matrix movie, but instead a film about the actual saga.""Rating: C-",Notr

I'm no specialist in CGI effects, and fighting scenes, but the the first half of the movie is Tarkowski level, with clues and referrals to ...discover them....everywhere, and the second half an ode to freedom, which is harder to get the older you are, as Don Juan said, when describing to Castaneda the enemies of the man of knowledge. All in all I found it brilliant an deeper than many movies, at the Matrix One level. Thoroughly enjoyed it!",Notr
761,"Even among sci-fi movies, The Matrix trilogy holds a hallowed position. Watching the trilogy, you get a grand unifying sense of deeper truth and philosophy similar to what binge watching Lord of the rings or Harry Potter movies brings.This absolute failure of an attempt at a money-grab however, is on the same sci-fi level as 'Alien Vs. Predator' or 'Universal Solider' and watching it feels as such and definitely doesn't feel like a continuation of the previous three movies, despite it force-feeding us scenes from the previous movies every few minutes.Just to be clear, the second and third movies in the trilogy get a bad rap for little reason, they had a lot of philosophical undertones without being too on the nose, and were visually attractive as well.This 4th movie is so so poorly conceived and even more badly executed that you have to wonder how the same director wrote the previous trilogy.Too on the nose, too trying to be meta without succeeding, too low budget.It just seems that the audience's sensibilities have far far exceeded the director's pathetic attempts at ""ideas"" which don't succeed at all.The new Morpheus, Smith and Merovingian characters are jokes forcibly written into this movie without any rhyme or reason at all. They have ~ 2-3 minutes of screen time at most without any consequence. I can see doing that to Merovingian but Smith and Morpheus?The jokes don't land, there's no character development, the action scenes are surprisingly bland and have no effect and almost every few scenes there's a flashback from one of the previous movies which gets super duper irritating very quickly.All in all, a gigantic failure and a frustrating experience.",Notr
762,"This film is really kind of a mixed bag. I feel confident about the rating that I have assigned to this film but I'm mostly going to talk about my personal criticisms.I actually really liked the concept of the story, I do think they could have done a much better job at wrapping things up, especially when you consider all the new story elements that were introduced going into this film.There are also small moments throughout the film where there is a struggle to feel naturally immersed into the tone of a scene.Sometimes a dramatic situation is unfolding but it doesn't feel convincing, I'm talking about a situation looking so unnatural that you end up getting shifted into a stage-theatre viewing perspective, becoming aware that they're actors/actresses trying to play characters, acting out a situation.Every issue I've stated above is really unique & did not exist so enormously when compared to the previous matrix movies, all of which I love & rate highly.It just feels like the matrix resurrections wasn't planned out with the care & effort that it deserved. It felt like I watched the work of someone smart who had a great idea for a story but was ultimately trying to rush their assignment during the filming stages.",Notr

I don't know how adding meta stuff makes the movie any entertaining. Action scenes too were just meh.

He understands humans, so he uses fear of the unknown against us.

But that's only because there is SO much else that this sequel does right.It's so rare that we see a blockbuster with this much unique ambition. I thought Christopher Nolan was the only one still doing that, but here we are. The Wachowski imagination isn't dead yet.The action sequences are such an improvement over the ones in Revolutions-a refreshing return to form. They feature some truly mind-bending visuals that tell the story through action, and it's always a welcome presence when so much of this complex story has to be told through characters explaining this world to us.Speaking of world-building, here they add quite a bit of fresh material to the machine-infused world of the original films. New technology and imaginative concepts breathe new life into this universe, and I'm excited to see what's done next.The acting is quite a bit better in this film than the previous ones, and the themes are expanded upon in natural, infinitely more human ways! This new story explores love and the power of the human need for passionate pursuits far more effectively than either of the previous two sequels.The film's opening chapter makes some self-aware jokes about how franchise revivals and reboots are what sell nowadays and that tired of hacks keep churning out the same bland media over and over again. But that's not what The Matrix Resurrections is-although it is flawed and falls short of achieving the original's groundbreaking nature, this film is as fresh and I could have expected a forced fourth entry in The Matrix saga to be.",Notr

Why did they have to bring Neo and Trinity back?Also, this movie rode on the back of the trilogy (too much) instead of holding up itself, the story was overthought and confusing (not in a good way).

Yahya Abdul-Mateen II stood out as absolute trash (I am being generous) with the worst writing and Neil Patrick Harris who is a fantastic actor with equal bad writing.The choreography is exactly what you would expect from a cash-grab. Remember how the actors had to learn Kung-Fu in the original? That's why it looked awesome. This shoddy product replaces it with quick cuts and fake punches.One of the worst nostalgia-cashgrabs ever, since the ""makers"" did not watch the original trilogy and the absurd amount of footage they used from the trilogy.The comedy or consistent parody towards the trilogy physically hurt and is never funny.Remember that the Neo we knew was the only ""chosen one"" who fell in love? He was also the 6th I think? Oh yea, Trinity died! And no way you can save her after the way she died!The love story was not the significant aspect of the trilogy. It was important, because it influenced Neos decision that lead to stop/halt of the cycle. But It was still Morpheus who enabled the story, while Agent Smith unknowingly gave Neo something to negotiate for the treaty. This ""love"" angle makes no sense. Making trinity to the ""One"" makes less sense.

784,"""No one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)Although I am not the best person to ask about what happened in the three previous installments of The Matrix, the new high-concept thriller The Matrix Resurrections makes some sense because writer-director Lana Wachowski (helming solo without sister Lilly) and her colleagues have crafted a saner story with a classic romance (well, maybe classic only a bit). The usual slo-mo bullets, shape shifting, and outrageous homage to virtual reality are there but framed around the reunion of Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity/Tiffany (Carrie Anne Moss).Although the duo is resurrected from their deaths in Revolutions, how the filmmakers justify the two resurrections I'll leave to sci-fi geeks who eat up this meta-commentary on virtual reality. Because of Neo's longing to reunite with Trinity, I found myself analyzing how Reeve's previously wooden responses now seem genuine. It's because he has such a low-affect anyway, that snooze is transformed into a deeply-felt emotion coming out of a place only love could make surface.For those who care at all about the history of cinema, approach Matrix Revolutions as a reboot with new takes on its own concept that itself is unwieldly and at times inscrutable. If you are into this Christopher-Nolan-like mind-puzzle, you'll delight in the twists and turns that say Lana Wachowski is leaving the previous three installments for new territory.

789,"As much as the Matrix... ""freed our minds"" with a philosophy that's so in ingulfed into pop culture over 20 years later, that it makes this sequel seem like just another movie, The Matrix is also about an advancement of visual effects that blew people's minds.I kinda knew this film would not be able to do that. The special effects on the Matrix Resurrections look no more special than any other movie I've seen in the past 20 somewhat years, so Lana Wachowskis just has to live with the fact that she invented the whole she put herself in (not a bad legacy to have)
Snice they could not beat what they did they embraced it. Like how the visual effects were an important story arch to the original movie this also makes the groundbreaking ""Bullet time"" as a major story plot in the picture, and I have to confess that may not have been the best idea because like a ton of movies that followed The Matrix, pointing out the Bullet time effect to exploit it did not really make the movie better.Getting back to the philosophy, it's not groundbreaking, its nostalgic. In that way it's fun. The fourth installment is all too aware of itself and its place in cinema history and it makes fun of it, which made the movie fun.The one part of the philosophy I did love was the upgrade on the fellowship between Neo and Trinity. I remember seeing the first matrix and thinking it was perfect until one of my teachers pointed out a flaw in which Trinity's only purpose in the film was to be in love with Neo, a perfect movie stereotype. I feel like number four has evolved their relationship beyond the common construct of love and I'll be happy to talk about that to anyone who wants to listen (and even those who don't). If Resurrections gave me anything it's that.Keanu Reeves is Keanu Reeves. We all love him and seeing him in anything would be boss. This could have been John Wick four of Bill and Ted four or Speed 3 and we would totally want to see Keanu in it. It was great seeing Carrie Anne Moss as Trinity again totally happy about that and last and certainly great, Jada Pinkett Smith reprises her role from the first round of sequels, and it all works for me. It's the best.Jonathan Groff was an actor who played an old character in a new form, and I liked what he did as that character. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is a great actor playing an old character in a new form and unfortunately for his greatness nobody in the audience is going to say they prefer his version of the character over the originator.Out of the new characters I liked one named Bugs the best, but it's not saying much. I understood the focus on the old characters over the new, but I also feel that the new characters were weak and underdeveloped.My biggest complaint: not enough kung fu in it!I said a lot and I would say more but the interesting thing about talking about the Matrix 4 is that it reveals too much about the movie. It's not going to change your life like the first one. It's like playing an 8-bit game upgraded with 16-bit graphics, but importantly it's still a great movie to watch.So, take the red pill.",Notr

We must wake up and smell the coffee - that's why they call it ""the Industry"" most of the people producing movies do it in order to gain profits.Considering this, the movie could've been much worse, the actors did their work professionally, and the writing team set out from the start to explain to whomever wants to listen why they had to do it - which is the reason the entire thing is feeling like a parody at certain moments. And if you think about it this way, you'll realize it's not all that stupid. At certain moments it's even clever. Having said that, as a whole it's still a pale shade of the original reducing most of philosophy into the simplistic cliché ""nothing is stronger than love"" - love was there in the original but then it was an added layer. One more element that made it so fascinating. In this version the clever bits feel like they were added because the entire story became way too simplistic so they added a few clever twists. And then, because the entire atmosphere shifts when we do get the darker bits, they almost feel external. Not to mention the fact you realize all too often how senseless it is. Which means - suspension of disbelief doesn't work well enough, and suspension of disbelief is probably the very key to all good science fiction.Bottom line - the main reason it's so bad is that it's the fourth chapter for a trilogy that shouldn't have had a fourth chapter. If you stop for a second or two and think about it chapter two was an in between chapter that could never stand on it own; and the third chapter never stood a chance because the buildup was so over hyped that no movie could end it properly. So the real masterpiece was just the very first chapter which was real mind blowing in all aspects of movie making. So much so that we almost forgot that it was the only real gem of the entire franchise.",Notr

793,"LIKES:The Nostalgia:
My experience with the Matrix is like many with loads of things that I remember making the movie amazing. Resurrection tries very hard to bring all that to the first installment, providing fan service and references to hopefully distract and please the already high stakes audience. Status of famous moments, classic lines littered in the dialogue, Easter eggs of props, and even classic scenes litter this movie in hopes of pulling you back into the world of computers and deception. At times, there is great awe in what they pulled back into this movie, claps and applause at the details, the shots, and the reliving of the classic movies with modern day graphics to whet the appetite as to what else will be tied into the movie. It's that foundation to an extent that makes for a good sequel, helping to erect a modern twist to the film.The Humor:
While not the classiest of the bunch, nor the most unique, Matrix Resurrections gets points for the foresight of being its own critic with the way they did the humor. It jabs at itself and finds a way to bring some meta humor into the mix in hopes of pointing out all the nuances that came with this revival, including poking at the company itself. A bold move and well timed, that irony comedy is a slight plus to the opening manner in the place of this film.The Logic To Some Degree:
The movie had a lot of gaps in code to patch through, and to some extent they were able to accomplish this with the story telling. A hybrid of old and new, Resurrections takes the time to explain (what was probably already known) and helps again bridge the past to the present with some decent explanations, some skeletal work, and some promise of the technological adaptation that this series thrives on. It's a logic that is semi-befitting of the Matrix and was the story elements I was hoping to dive more into, but it was a start.The Special Effects:
While heavily CGI based at times, the movie did manage to immerse us back into the world of the Matrix. Lots of elements from the old have been updated, with bullet time, over the top stunts, and the classic agent moves coming to life much more effortlessly. Other elements like the real world, the ship designs, and some of the new action holds more of the spectacles and I loved getting the world to unfold again with updated technology. It's the highlight of the movie for me and certainly the biggest draw to the theater for this reviewer if you needed to maximize the experience.DISLIKES:
The Villains To An Extent:
The first Matrix held a lot of promising villains for Neo to try and work around in his quest for enlightenment and truth. For Resurrections however, the antagonists are a bit meh in my books compared to the design of the old. The new Smith is just not that antagonizing and seems limited to the old form, in both performance and style, feeling like this washed out version that needs another movie to get right. All the big bad machines that once were hunting and lethal, are background noise that did not fit as smoothly into the world and felt sort of forced for the parts we saw. As for the Analyst, there is again promise and he held the most sinister aspects thanks to Neil Patrick Harris, but even he seems a bit downgraded compared to the trilogy's band of elite programs. Even the ""climactic moments"" of this character were limited, a farce of the balance that was once held between the titans of the Matrix.Missing the Philosophical/Complexity:
The first three Matrix movies were all about the layers of the movie and how deep the corruption went in the solution for liberation from the confines of the computer. Amidst the chaos of the Sci-Fi story, the movie held philosophical questions and religious references that were integrated but never overtook the story element. The balance was a fantastic, multi-tiered movie, which made you think and added mystery to the movie, further pulling us into deciphering the code and the way the plot would unfold given everything. In this film though... that intrigue and mystery is missing, all the answers laid out for you in a bland manner that is simplistic and mediocre in the new age of this world. Throw in the new approach destroying a lot of the religious context the first film held, and the very foundations that pulled me in further drop to deletion.The Lackluster Characters At Time:
Again, we held connections to the crew of the original ship and the real world as they tried to accomplish the missions to break the Matrix and stop the war. The connection to the characters added suspense to the mix and a bit of heartbreak when a character was removed from the lines due to fate's circumstance. Yet in the Matrix Resurrections, that was missing big time for me, replacing the approach with minimalistic characters who gave enough to be remembered, but did not establish the connection to really care if they survived. The disconnection again led to boring moments and a disengagement from the movie as a whole.The Nostalgia Gets too Much:
Bringing nostalgia into the mix is a wonderful tactic to reignite the spark, but when you take it too far that it gets in the way of the story, that's when it goes too far. Matrix takes all the retro ideas and blows them to too high of proportions, cramming all the patchy references and fan service to the tale that it severely disrupts the programming of a good story/movie that it could have been. It tried too hard to include too much of the old, and eventually got the point of eye rolling annoyance for me as these things can sometimes get into. To give you an example, there are literally a few moments in the opening acts of the movie that are almost straight up copies of the original, only much less coordinated, complied, or of good quality. That unoriginality and shortcuts are boring to fans like me and was carried too far for my tastes.The Action:
You might think that despite all this, there has to be enough action to offset the gaps and limitations to the story, like numbers 2 and 3 right? Nope. Resurrections action is kind of lackluster as well, missing the pizazz, quality, and again suspense that mad ethe first three movies the edgy picture that it once was. Outside of bland characters that are playing the roles, the Matrix 4's action is lowered for a few reasons. First, the action is kind of low key and ill-placed, with most of the moments either poor remakes, or short lived moments that soon get bogged down in conversation. A few moments manage to start hitting the level of the past, primarily a train scene, but this is a rare moment given the nearly 2.5 hours that was quite a shame. Second, the visuals and fight styles are a bit cheesy and simplistic as the movie progresses. Remember the past where we had nail biting moves, close calls, injuries, and uber moments of exploiting the Matrix to pull off killer moves (wall running, sword swinging, dodges with bikes, etc.)? However, this movie is again lacking, taking the promising moments and soon turning them into stale moments of simple pushing and pulling that are lazy and overdone. Third: Much of the action takes place offscreen, or we decide to pan out and have it take place in a wide simplistic shot. The scenes feel uncoordinated and absent and lack the fluidity that we once held, which again was not what the resurrection needed. Finally, the times we do see the fights, they feel artificial, and the editing is very rapid, cut away, and stitched to only further minimize the majesty of the fight. All of it felt low caliber, lost to everything this movie once cherished.The Opening Act:
My word was this the worst part of the movie for me. Resurrections is trying to get you into trying to wonder what is going on, but it get diluted into a messy Groundhog's Day approach that lost entertainment and value. It took way too long to get to any remote adventure, was so convoluted in their approach to figure out what they wanted to present and it just failed to be entertaining. No close calls, no mystery, and very sloppy versions of classic scenes did little to give me the balance we once held and had me fighting sleep as I hoped there would be the Matrix magic coming.The VERDICT:
Overall, Matrix Resurrections did not revive the movie the way I wanted it to and instead brought it back the way I expected it to happen. There is foundation to work with and potential to make some deeper movies that will explore a lot of concepts if given the right director/writer as the new story tries to find itself. Certainly there are some wow factors in special effects, promising actors, and some logic that bridges the gaps, but they can only do so much given the gaping flaws of the movie. The fourth movie does too much and seems lost in the modern and the old, diluting the quality for the quantity in this attempt to bring back the franchise that had wrapped up nicely. All the things I loved about the Matrix had been reduced to level 1-2 in terms of quality and I was bored for much of the film with no connection. All the action, storytelling, thinking, and quality science fiction that the original trilogy held is sort of gone and I kind of now only care about the story for that amazing game that could be on the horizon. In my opinion, this movie is all about watching at home, and I can't say I would be looking forward to a sequel unless they get back to the roots and reign in the wild west of ideas that this reboot is sort of in right now.My scores for Matrix 4 are:Action/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0

794,"Matrix Resurrections is very meta in two ways: it self references much of the Matrix franchise but mostly the first Matrix movie via various clips and cameos. And then it also references how the Matrix might have been like for the Wakowskis to create it: video games, spin offs, meetings with Warner Bros executives about a Matrix 4. Fortunately the meta quality works for the narrative and doesn't get confused about itself or schmaltzy like some meta movies might. While eventually the repeated clips might have you started to wonder about pandemic budget cuts I don't necessarily think it was so overdone.What really caused confusion for me was the various new tech (ally robots from the matrix world?) and how that came to be and why exactly it works beyond new marketable toys to make. And then the whole story with the new Architect and his plans and the intervention of a familiar agent. What? Why?The Matrix Resurrecrtions adds an element of reality check to the effect of The Matrix philosophy: is it eye opening, or does it cause insanity and mental breaks? What really is the consequence of introducing the idea of a binary ""real"" and ""fake"" world?I like how Resurrections brings the unease of quantum leaps to the surface. However while it also solves the conflict by introducing the idea of synthesis rather than rejection, how it gets there is unclear and relies upon Neo's quick assimilation into his old self and his old ideas. This is a problem because it was strongly established that Neo was ""bluepilled."" It doesn't quite work that he could question his perception so strongly and then revert so quickly.Matrix Resurrections is perhaps more of an epilogue to the Matrix trilogy rather than a true fourth chapter. It deals with the aftermath of the Matrix films for both the audience and the film creators. It is a lighter, funnier film, though also at times begrudging it's own creation. I appreciate the film as a meditation on The Matrix's impact and the failings of its own ideals. With its many clips the film is as much reminiscence as new content. I think it's a good film for fans to enjoy and makes no pretense at being as landmark as the first or second Matrix fils.",Notr

The action sequences are completely spoiled by the rapid cuts and close-ups of characters faces, which feels like a kick in the teeth considering what ""Matrix"" did with arguably much more limited technology at the beginning of the century.I wouldn't be this harsh with my rating, but the director has some big boots to fill when picking up such an iconic franchise. I believe there to be a lack of comprehension in what made the original ""Matrix"" as great as it still is to this day.",Notr

800,"The film is a symbol of the excessive demands of the makers. The main thing is to squeeze in as much fancy as possible, which then seems far-fetched. The film also gives no time for images and ideas to take effect. Also, no tension is created by the hectic pace.The minimalism and precision from the first part is missing. There is no Matrix atmosphere.And if a serious film has to work with jokes, then everything is clear.With a series, the missing 200 minutes of explanation could have been sorted out somehow.",Notr
801,"I am honestly not so sure what to write about that movie, and I'm not saying that in a necessarily negative way. Truth be told, I am no huge fan of ""The Matrix"" series of films. I like the first, dislike the second, and enjoy the third - however, I harbor no true love toward them. That said, I was looking forward to ""The Matrix Resurrection."" And now having seen it I can say that, while I recognize this is a middle of the road film that is, in practically every way, less than the original three movies, I can't deny that this managed to entertain me.One thing is evidently clear once the credits roll: director Lana Wachowski did not want to make this movie. The word ""lazy"" comes to mind almost immediately; from the visuals, to the action sequences, you can watch this and realize it is no longer the genre-defining series that it once was. Everything looks too bright, almost as if Lana and crew intended to make a made for television film. The action? While it isn't horrible, it isn't good. Forget wide shots, long takes, and steady cams - for some inexplicable reason the action is filmed in close-up, rapidly edited, shaky camera *heavy sigh*. Granted, it isn't as terrible as the action in films such as ""Taken 3,"" as you can still mostly decipher what's happening and to whom. However, that doesn't stop the action sequences from being a giant and noticeable leap down compared to what they were in the previous movies. My only conclusion, and certain lines of dialogue in this movie point to this deduction, is that Lana purposefully sabotaged aspects of this film as petty revenge for seemingly being ""forced"" to make it.Nothing really stands out in this movie - there is nothing as memorable as when Neo stops bullets in mid air for the first time, or fights an army of Agent Smiths for 10 minutes. All of that complaining aside though, I'll be damned if I didn't actually enjoy this. There is just something inherently interesting and thought provoking about watching a movie where people slowly discover that the world they're living in isn't as real as they once thought, and that's no exception here. Keanu Reeves is as likable as ever, and watching him act alongside Carrie-Anne Moss is most definitely worth the price of admission. The first hour or so of this movie is certainly the most compelling - however, I never once thought that the pacing dragged. I was honestly consistently entertained, even though I don't think the movie as a whole was that good. I enjoyed the more small-scale nature of the story which really empowered Keanu, Moss, and Neil Patrick Harris to chew up the scenery every time they are on screen, which is gratefully, a lot of the time. Sure, in between the acting you'll be graced with mediocre action sequences, but the good news is once those scenes are over, you'll be right back with the characters you've grown to know and love. ""The Matrix Resurrections"" does take a more character-focused approach to its story, which really did manage to keep me engaged.Listen I don't even know what else to say here - is ""The Matrix Resurrections"" worth your time? Judging by other peoples' reviews, probably not. However, if you're as easily entertained as I am, you'll probably find at least something to enjoy here. I'd say give it a shot on HBO Max - that way, if you hate it, you can simply turn it off.",Notr
802,"After seeing this with my father who saw the trilogy 16 times now, we were both satisfied. The action was cool and the plot was intruiging.

803,"I still believe The Matrix is one of the most significant films of my lifetime (not to mention, one of my best theater experiences ever). The sequels went awry because they tried to explain EVERYTHING. The action, vibes, and ideas still worked, but the details were never the point. This particular sequel worked better than the others because it was mostly a trippy fever dream version of The Matrix. What was that reflection? What does this mean? It worked best when I was confused and wondering. As a result, the first and last thirds were genuinely fun, even if the action was muddy; the middle third was a bit explain-y. Overall, though, pretty fun to hang with Neo and Trinity for a while (and forget that 3rd movie ever happened).",Notr

808,"Entertaining and very atmospheric, Morbius manages to serve up yet another helping of campy superhero indulgence despite many little flaws. I'll start off with the problems I had with this film- that mainly being its blatant editing and CGI. I know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as fitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have been rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and violence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a man acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot of films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry Morbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced for comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony would have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office gross. I know i've complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure it's messy, Matt Smith's character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very entertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that are interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to control himself. There's a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic moments, there's a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with the film's story as well as Leto on screen. In the end, I enjoyed Morbius- it is far from perfect but it was a solid superhero endeavor and I'm curious to see what they may do with this character next.My Rating: 6.3/10.",Notr

Unlike Venom, which has more recognition in general audience.This is not a bad movie. Mediocre at its best. Fun action sequences, good atmosphere for its genre and characters, but again, it's very... basic.The conflict is very predictable and overused. Somehow the runtime is too long for what the storyline trying to tell, with that being said, weirdly some moments still felt rushed.No actual character development, no memorable hero moments.

In truth I don't think any of the performances were bad per se, but they were all so bland.It didn't help the characters that the writing was so poor. They had no faith in the audience at all, spoon feeding us exposition in the most clunky ways imaginable.The action was truly dreadful. It was either in super slow-mo which exposed the poor CGI, or it was at super speed to the point you were just watching blurs.The story was so basic and formulaic. I hate to say it but I was actually bored watching it. The pacing also felt very off, as the film came to a very abrupt end, before subjecting us to some bonkers credits scenes.I can forgive bad writing. I can forgive bad action.

814,"I have to admit that I had really been looking forward to watching ""Morbius"" ever since I saw the first trailer. And having been reading the comic books, I will say that Michael Morbius is one of my favorite Marvel characters, so it was nice that the character was finally brought to the big screen.But then the movie was delayed and delayed again, and once finally out a lot of bad reviews were swarming the movie, so I was actually somewhat reluctant and hesitant about actually sitting down to watch it. But I decided to ignore the bad reviews and go see how the movie would treat the comic book character.Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless managed to put together a fair enough storyline. I will say that it was aimed more at an audience fully and wholly unfamiliar with the Michael Morbius character. And I can understand that approach to the first movie with the character, as to introduce a whole new audience of viewers to the character, and not go in on the deep end and do fan service to us whom have been reading the comic books for years.Personally I had hoped for a bit more in terms of story, but it was actually adequate enough in terms of entertainment. An origin story for a character new to the cinema screen is in its place, I suppose.I was also somewhat hesitant about it being Jared Leto to don the mantle of the living vampire, given the swing and miss performance of Joker in the 2016 ""Suicide Squad"", but then again he was amazing in the 2000 movie ""Requiem for a Dream"". Thankfully, then his performance as Michael Morbius was quite good and actually was suitable for the character from the comic books.Visually then you are in for quite a treat, given the fact that this is a Marvel movie. The CGI and special effects are quite impressive in the movie, as they are in all Marvel movies. So if you enjoy flashy CGI and special effects, then ""Morbius"" doesn't disappoint.All in all, then I will say that I was more than adequately entertained by the 2022 movie ""Morbius"", though I had hoped for a bit more in the story department. But hopefully the future will add more layers to the character and his story.My rating of director Daniel Espinosa's 2022 movie lands on a seven out of ten stars.",Notr
815,"This is an early review. There are no plot details (spoilers) here, however if you want to go in completely clean, then skip the rest of this review. Not that there is anything to reveal.The basic set up as depicted in the trailers and advertising is that Michael Morbius is a doctor in the Marvel Universe who is afflicted by a rare and gruesome blood disease. Setting out to find a cure for himself and others of his ilk, he winds up becoming a vampire and proceeds to go head first into adventures in the same vicinity of Spider-Man. This is all in the marketing material that has appeared over the past two years.Speaking of the trailer, there is zero connection to other Marvel movies nor the MCU in this film. Essentially everything you saw in the trailers does not exist in this movie. Like at all. This is studio executive meddling and false advertising at its pinnacle.In terms of technical filmmaking, this is a mess. The action is a disaster. It harkens back to the disastrous comic book entries from the days of yore, a la the horrific Fan4stic, X-Men Origins Wolverine, Thor2 and Green Lantern. It's just one messy CGI PG13 cut scene after another. I don't know if the director, Daniel Espinosa or the studio are to blame, however, given the fact that Tom Rothman, the Perpetrator in Chief of Sony, was also head of 20th Century Fox back when they were churning horrific movies, my money is that the disastrous production that is Morbius is to be blamed on Tom Rothman and his henchman suits at Sony.",Notr

It's trying to be one in the Underworld flair. Maybe too much Underworld. One of the problems is that Jared Leto cannot carry a movie. He needs a stronger lead to work off of. When he has that he's more than enough. The subtlety of the effects works for me. The bad guy Milo was a little too one dimensional and flat. Predictable. Weak writing in that regard. Not enough character development. I can see Morbius working in an ensemble MCU cast. Hopefully he will be given that chance.,Notr

That is unfair to compare it to such other films as Morbius is a fresh take on Marvel it feels. It is obvious that the delays ended up holding back what this movie could have been, perhaps what it truly should have been. It was enjoyable to watch from start to end. Loved the action sequences and CGI was beautiful. Takes a little bit to get through the more monotonous beginnings, but once you get to sink your teeth into the good parts, oh boy does it deliver. Some characters needed more development and the story what is a bit disjointed. Jared Leto is finally in a role that suits him, Morbius and Leto will only get better with more appearances. I rated it a 7/10 because a 7/10 to me means that it was an enjoyable movie regardless of whatever may be wrong with it, and I would gladly watch again. It is clear it would have been better suited as a rated R film, but with its current restrictions down to PG-13 I would say it is worth a watch at least. Don't expect to be blown away, except maybe by some of the action and CGI. I can see ratings from 5/10 to 7/10 being a fair range as everyones taste are different, but some of these other reviews I see are just taking it too far because it is not what Marvel is used to pushing.",Notr

Even if it's the first movie you ever watched, and can't compare it to any other movie, how can you think it's excellent movie?! The acting is terrible, the animations are amateurish, the plot is predictable and boring, and some of it also makes no sense. It was a complete waste of my time. I was amaze to discover that the movie as a connection to marvel and to spiderman world.I hope for the good of all humanity they don't make a sequel. I will support World War III just to prevent it.

For example, the Morbius boat is full of armed guards just to have some action scene there.Action scenes are short and full of blurred colored effects or dark effects and none of them work.Uninteresting characters. You have Morbius, a new made vampire that needs to drink human blood to live. You could explore this in so many ways, like trying to drink blood from animals, buying blood from blood bank and making needing people dying because lack of blood packs, leading to ""I will drink blood from bad people"".

Especially the CGI.The major fail is the timeline and this whole thing where they try to connect the dots in a weird/confusing way. I was baffled a few times on what the heck was going on, obviously I understood it, but it was odd.Jared Leto did an OK job, considering that I'm not a fan of his movies, and I'm someone who hated his Joker in Suicide Squad. Otherwise, all the other actors were doing ok.I see what Sony is doing, and I wanna say this: Dear Sony, LISTEN TO MARVEL!! And stop trying to act like you got it. You don't. Marvel knows better.

831,Much like venom it seems people are going to either love or hate anything from the Sonyverse. Some hate it because it's not in the MCU and still uses characters from the MCU spiderverse. Some love it for its more dark delivery and darker comedy. I actually enjoy what Sony is doing by making movies for the more vicious anti heroes while making them grounded for the most part. The MCU rarely touches on those important details. Morbius is very much like the first venom in its set up. Gives a nice origin story with some intriguing body horror and more gruesome than normal imagery for a comic book film. Definitely has some scattered plot pieces but it's serviceable. Also leaves more room for expansion in the world if the Sonyverse. Leto was great imo and still proves he's a fantastic actor. Visuals are very effective and vibrant.

833,"Morbius (2022) is a movie my wife and I recently watched in theatres. The storyline follows a doctor with a rare blood disease that is in his final days. Him and his childhood friend do their best to cope with being on their death bed. When the doctor has a breakthrough he discovers the cure is as much a curse as a gift...that doesn't prevent his friend from wanting a taste. Can Morbius find a way to save him and his friend and modify his cure or will his friend get his hands on the cure and cause all new problems?This movie is directed by Daniel Espinosa (Safe House) and stars Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream), Matt Smith (The Crown), Jared Harris (Mad Men), Adria Arjona (Pacific Rim: Uprising), Tyrese Gibson (Baby Boy) and Al Madrigal (The Way Back).The storyline for this picture is very well told with great character backstories and evolution. You can easily find yourself rooting and relating to both the good and bad guy. The action scenes are excellent and very well done. The opening boat scene really sets the tone for the movie. I liked the ""smoke"" effects around the characters and there's lots of solid kill sequences and use of blood. I did wish they kicked the gore up another level but that's more of a preference, especially when there's so many kills. I'd also say I wasn't a huge fan of how the ending was executed in the final fight. They did do a good job of tying in the multiverse to keep you aligned on when and where this takes place.Overall this is not a great addition to the marvel universe but it is an entertaining one, much like the Venom movies. I would score this a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Notr
834,A vampire film without blood. That says it all. And it clearly shows that the film has been poorly thought since the start. Not to mention that the character is probably one of the most unknown and uninteresting comic book characters.,Notr
835,3.5 out of 5 stars.Morbius is a pretty fair superhero film that may be thin on plot and decent action sequences. It does add an entertaining adaptation bringing in another character that is supposedly a Spider man villain. May not be as fun as the Venom movies. Jared Leto does a great job playing a sick Dr. Michael Morbius. Who is on a desperate search for a cure from his blood borne illness. Which one will be leading him into becoming a vampire. Adria Arjona also did great playing his love interest. Matt Smith is a bit flat with his character and also playing a villain that is one dimensional and forgettable. Jared Harris playing as Morbius mentor is also thin with his character. Along with Tyrese Gibson which the script did not give these characters anything more besides be on the hunt for Morbius.The film is very fast paced. And the script does not give much character development with any of the supporting characters besides Michael and Martine (Adria Arjona). The plot is thin and may not be as strong. The action sequences were okay. With the fast movements with the characters and editing which makes the scenes more of a chore to see than increase the entertainment value.If your looking for a quick superhero escapism in the theatres this film will be great. The direction did not do anything new to make it stand out compared to any other superhero films. There is a mid credit scene to give you a hint on where this character will be placed in the universe. The film is not great but still delivers some entertainment.,Notr
836,"Perhaps the best movie I have ever seen. Beautiful cinematography, sharp writing, deep character progression, and most importantly; a masterclass of acting.

Well get real how many vampire movies have I seen, from Dracula to Twilight and What They Do In The Shadows, I know every nuance about vampire life, and yet here the movie presumed we knew nothing.Just as the movie was starting to flag in came adult Milo, played by Matt Smith, he dominated the screen and the stark contrast between the method style of acting and Thespianism could not have been more noticeable. It was great!To me the jury is out on Jared Leto he has the look but not the charisma, he was proficient in this role but nothing more than that!I really enjoyed the CGI and the way Jared, moved, flew, glided and transformed the rest was unremarkable.I'm giving this a firm 7 outta 10, it was well worth a watch even if in conclusion it was quite a mundane origin story.",Notr

A total yawn fest, with nothing even remotely worth praising.I have watched many vampire movies, from all decades, and I cannot recall one of them that made me want to stop watching as much as this one.

This vampire film is almost without visible blood, and what little is seen is black, while the only red blood is in medical bags that are given for transfusion, like wtf. Next, I would describe this film as - super ultra fast action, because Morbius is moving so fast that the shots can barely catch it. Oh yes did I mention that as Morbius (the vampire) moves and flies he leaves behind a trace of color like say a character in a fortnite ! Wtf. Oh yes, and the movie has the dumbest ending ever, outrageously shortened.

847,"FIRST OFF: I scrolled down through some of these reviews, I understand, and agree with some of the criticisms I see about this film, others.. well I can just see you really want Spidey & Company back at Marvel & I do believe it does help cloud the judgement just a bit & I get it, now am I saying this movie is perfect? NO. Is it good? Well, no. But it's okay. To go to the extreme that this movie is the second coming of Fantastic Four (2015) is an extreme to me, and If you disagree, you are entitled to your opinion, but I will just advise you to go rewatch it again.Morbius is a cool little movie, that I see as a bigger risk than any of the previous spider-man related projects it has dropped, while I, being a comic reader for most of my life wasn't jumping for joy when it was announced, I threw my respect for trying it at least. The product was what I pretty much expected; the films' story does what it can with what very little it has to work with, it's not groundbreaking, but I will say I was able to look through it's basic dialogue, and story errors to see great performances from both leads (Leto, Smith) The CGI, I believe was worth my price of admission, and I RARELY mention that as a positive on any review, I was pretty impressed and had no reason to be. The action scenes are really cool, have some fascinating shots, and feel somehow immersive, leaving me with this feeling like I almost was there seeing him experience some of the beauty in some powers. There are a few moments that story wise you will scratch your head or ask yourself if you missed something & I believe I fault that on the runtime and I also question what may have been left on the cutting room floor as I had noticed a couple of scenes from the trailer missing from this movie, which I really hope didn't happen but I understand this is a typical studio decision, even though 2 hours is average for a blockbuster. An additional, and final criticism I do share with some is that this absolutely should've been rated R, no question about it, and it probably would've hit better, but then again the budget cut would've probably gave us worse looking CGI.At the end of the day, check it out if you're thinking about it, if you're on the fence, just don't.The real lesson is...

This film doesn't seem like it was made to be a one time outstanding amazing film, it felt more like a good solid film that you could rewatch and that it's building up to something bigger.

851,"Delayed a total of 6 times on its way to its eventual release this week around the world, Sony and Marvel's collaboration to bring its anti-hero Dr. Michael Morbius to life appeared to be one of those cursed productions that was doomed from the start and upon seeing this toothless and spineless comic book adaptation on the big screen its safe to say that the world would've been far better off had Morbius stayed delayed permanently.An incredibly inept feature from director Daniel Espinosa, who somehow keeps getting Hollywood films to make with significant budgets and name brand casts despite never actually directing a good film, Morbius feels far removed from most brands associated with the Marvel name as its $75 million dollar budget is nowhere to be found on screen as a blur of video game like CGI, amateurishly scripted scenes and poorly acted characters hog the films lifeless 100 minute runtime that can't come to an end quick enough.Failing as an origin story, with Michael's entire history set-up in one cringe-worthy flashback scene, an unnerving vampire tale and an action comic book film, it's hard to know what Morbius thought it was doing with its potentially entertaining material as Espinosa lets his leading man Jared Leto flounder in yet another high profile role that begs us to ask the question about his talent as a Hollywood leading man while he as a director ensures Morbius is nothing but an enigma of a character lost in a diabolical story that's hard to recall even mere minutes from walking out of the cinema.Sometimes with films that fail as badly as Morbius does there's snippets of what might have been found within them, moments that show not all hope was lost at all times but that's not the case with Espinosa and Leto's blockbuster that truly has no moments of escape from its grim, shaky cam filled collation of cinematic rubbish with the only slight glimpse of a better film coming from Matt Smith's villain Milo (yes that is what he is called throughout most of the film, Milo) with the well-liked one time Dr. Who at least appearing to have fun with his role while everyone else is about as enthusiastic as a bloodsucker heading into their coffin for a day time nap.Undoubtedly developed by Sony and Marvel to play a key role in the future with both Venom and Spider-Man properties, its hard to imagine how anyone will get excited coming away from this when it comes to the prospect of more Morbius being present in the biggest movie brand name going around and despite an attempt mid-credits too get audiences enthused by what may lay in store for Leto's charisma free biochemist in the near future, most will be merely rushing to the exit door to escape what is quite possibly the worst Marvel film we've yet seen.Final Say -Things never looked to good for poor old Morbius but not even the most pessimistic of pundits could've expected a film quite as bad as the one we get here, a DOA offering without purpose, intent or creativity, Marvel would do well to ensure Morbius never awakens again from a very long and hidden away slumber.1/2 a blood bag out of 5.For more reviews visit Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",Notr

853,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Morbius. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Morbius's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Vampire literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Morbius truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Morbius's existential catchphrase ""I am Morbius,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Daniel Espinosa's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

Who did they think would like this? It's slop. Cinematic slop. What kind of suicidal thoughts are these poor MCU writers having to make them write this? It feels like one of those writing exercises where you just don't stop writing until you have a page, and that's your story premise. However, most people edit them or just don't use them, if they're bad. Marvel clearly hired a stoner to write this movie. I can't say enough times how unbelievably bad the plot of this movie is.

860,"From the opening moments, it's clear this film is playing it safe-so safe, in fact, that the introduction makes Twilight's opening look like Macbeth. Morbius, a doctor-turned-vampire with an intriguing premise, is reduced to an origin story so formulaic it feels like a rejected episode of House. There's no suspense, no tension-just a guy injecting himself with bat DNA and hoping for the best. Spoiler: it doesn't work out for him-or the audience.Morbius isn't a villain; he's a tortured antihero grappling with his thirst for blood. On paper, that sounds fantastic. On screen, it's lukewarm at best. Jared Leto gives it his all, but his performance swings between cringey method acting and a vacant, fish-eyed stare. The character's moral ambiguity, a goldmine of potential, is barely touched upon, as if the writers were afraid to dive too deep and accidentally stumble upon something interesting.And then there's the action. Brace yourself. The fight scenes are a chaotic blend of cheesy PowerPoint effects and an overwhelming amount of CGI smoke. The bullet time? Overused to the point of parody, like a failed tribute to The Matrix. The result is incomprehensible, messy, and utterly devoid of impact. Is it a fight scene or a migraine-inducing music video? Hard to tell.Adria Arjona's Martine feels like a placeholder character. Supposedly the emotional core of the story, she ends up being a lifeless accessory with little purpose beyond looking pretty. Meanwhile, Matt Smith's over-the-top villain portrayal is campy enough to make you wonder if he wandered in from the set of a Scooby-Doo reboot. It's so hammy, you could make a sandwich out of it.And let's not forget the post-credit scenes, the cherry on this cinematic disaster. Not only do they add nothing of value, but they also manage to amplify the film's narrative incoherence. The clumsy nod to the Spider-Man universe feels less like an Easter egg and more like an awkward marketing stunt that nobody asked for.Morbius is the epitome of squandered potential. What could have been a gripping tale of a morally complex antihero instead becomes a B-movie smothered in lackluster CGI and uninspired storytelling. It's not scary, not funny, not engaging-it's just... nothing. In the end, this vampire doesn't sink its teeth into anything worthwhile, leaving you wondering if it even tried to.",Notr
861,"Morbius (2022) was Sony Pictures' follow-up to Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) and it was a monumental disaster, at least until Madame Web (2024) came out.Positives for Morbius (2022):
Matt Smith is clearly having a lot of fun as Milo in this movie. That's about it for positives.Negatives for Morbius (2022):
First of all, I have one question for Sony Pictures. Why is this movie PG-13, you have vampires in your movie and you don't make it Rated-R. I don't care if Sony wanted to make more money, this should've been a Rated-R movie and I've seen Rated-R movies make a lot of money in the past. Beyond that, Jared Leto as Michael Morbius is one of the most bland and boring characters I've seen in any superhero and comic book movie. You have Jared Harris, Adria Arjona and Tyrese Gibson in the movie and they don't do anything in the movie until the plot needs them to. The action is very lackluster and boring in the movie. Whenever the movie tries to be funny, it comes off as being cringeworthy and whenever it tries to be serious, it comes off as being unintentionally hilarious. And finally, the post-credit scene with Michael Keaton's Vulture is really stupid and it's clear that Sony Pictures wants to have their Sinister Six so badly even if it doesn't make any sense.Overall, Morbius (2022) is one of the worst superhero and comic book movies I've seen in my life and I am so tired with Sony Pictures and their Spider-Man Universe without Spider-Man in it.",Notr

865,"Morbius gets a lot of hate which is fair. It's not a great movie, however most people who have the strongest opinions have never watched it. The perfect thing to call this film is medicore. I've seem worse, but it has a lot to improve. The directors were to ambitious while making it and had to drop a lot of side plots, which led to a lot of plot holes and unanswered questions. One of the worst example of this is the first scene of the film. We see morbius with a group of mercanaries behind him on an island hunting for vampire bats. The island is even shown on the poster, so that means, that it will be important later in the movie, yes? Well... no. Not even once has this scene been mencioned in any way in the film. It should've been just a post credit scene, cause it certainly felt like it was. The other bad thing about this movie is the pacing. There's either too much, or not enough happening at one time. For example the flashback to morbius's childhood would seem like an really important part if the movie, and yes, it is important. Hovewer, this is probably the most rushed part of the movie. Everything is happening really fast, which makes it way too hard to understand than it has to be and makes it feel like it's been compressed. With such an important scene being so fast paced you'd think that so is the rest of the movie. It's not. Most of this film is way too slow, with 80% of the action happening in the last scenes of the movie. The action scenes are also nothing special. Most of the scenes are there because morbius is just staying offscreen doing nothing.With the whole rant i was just on, you could be surprised why I gave it such a good review. Even though it turned out the way it turned out. There are some good parts of the movie. Firstly, a lot of people have complained about how bad the cgi looks when morbius transforms and yes it doesn't look appealing, hovewer i think it could have been intentional. When morbius first transforms he is terrafied of what he became, acknowladging that he turned into a monster and this is who morbius truly is. Half human and a genius doctor, half monster, and the bad looking cgi emphasises the monster half, which is sometimes taking over the good side. The true reason why I gave it a 6/10 is because this movie has a lot of potential to grow. I mean the story is great in theory. I love the trope of a good person which has done a bad thing and they're forced to keep doing bad things to survive. Hovewer, morbius did not use this trope very well.

He should have his own mini team like the avengers.My friends say it needed more character development and more of a story to it. I persoanlly think they did develop the characters and story fairly well but yes they could have done with a little more. You don't want the movie to be too long, but I think another 20 mins of story building, built up from another 5 or 10 mins here and there would have done it.I liked the main female character, it would have been / would be nice to see their love story develop a little more.I don't like the person he met in cut scene, wtf?

868,"By any means this is not a good movie with interesting story and well-written characters. It's hard to determine, but maybe ""Morbius"" won the prize for the weakest film in SSU (Sony's Universe) and honestly it does with ease.Leto is ""okay"" in the role of Michael Morbius, the problem is that the role itself is not very well written. Matt Smith is the one who had the most fun with his role, everyone else is just there.The story is exactly what you expect to see - 90% similar to the previous two ""Venom"" movies, so there is no big mystery to unravel.The effects are pretty...how to say it...for the most part bad for a comicbook movie in 2022. Let's not forget that this movie was supposed to come out in 2020, initially before ""No Way Home"". However, I'm not sure that the people who worked on it did their job in the extra 2 years time, because...well I'll leave that to you.The main reason someone to be interested in this film is to understand how everything connects, given the easter eggs from the trailers. Well, don't expect too much, because you'll be disappointed.Morbius is another interesting character, who does not need a solo movie, only to be presented properly. Unfortunately, Sony again has surpassed themselves even after they squandered so much opportunities with the ""Venom"" movies. Honestly, I don't have high hopes for neither ""Kraven"" or ""Madame Web"". The standard is pretty low.The film is mediocre and feels like something straight from 2006, with some nasty effects and overall made just to make some dollars. Pitty. Disgrace to the character.I can say that the best...or rather the stupidest they have left for the end. I mean the credit scenes will make you shake your head and laugh.",Notr

If you can look past this though, you will see an interesting story about a man and his friend who suffered from a blood disease his entire life and just wanted to be cured. When he takes the cure and it has side effects that are horrible, he decides his friend would be better off the way his friend is for now. I would even say it is kind of sad.",Notr

871,"Morbius stars Jared Leto, Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris and Tyrese Gibson. Michael Morbius is in the process of curing his rare blood disorder when he unleashes something even more life threatening, but not to himself.This film is bad there is no sugar coating it, but I believe it's watchable. I say it's watchable because I can appreciate the simplicity and the combination of horror and marvel but what makes this movie bad is the lack of development. The film just moves from plot point to plot point without any character development. The plot moves quick and thats good but if you don't develop your characters the plot doesn't matter.The lead character in this film has very little development and it keeps him from being a compelling character. A lot of the scenes in this film feel like they were cut, as if they finished the scene and decided they didn't like it so they cut it down. Jared Leto is good as Morbius but without the development it doesn't matter.This lack of character development is not just for Michael Morbius it's for the entire cast. Which really sucks because I think Matt Smiths character Milo could've been really great. The performance by Matt was very enjoyable but there was far too little of him.They also have added a romantic relationship which again might've been good if they developed it more.There are quite a few emotional moments in this film but none of them are actually emotional and that is because the movie doesn't make the audience care.Overall this film is bad. With zero development, the film doesn't allow you to care about any of the characters involved. Without that character development it's hard to be invested in the plot.3.5/10.",Notr

874,"""Morbius"" is a superhero film based on the Marvel comic book character of the same name. Starring Jared Leto in the title role, it is one of the dullest, most boring superhero-related movies to be released in the past fifteen years.Since birth, Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has lived a life of constant physical pain due to a rare blood disease impeding his movement. As a doctor, Michael uses his medical knowledge to create a special kind of artificial blood filled with the genetic material of vampire bats in an effort to find a cure for both himself and others. After taking a sample of the cure, Michael's health improves significantly but soon he starts to display symptoms of superhuman vampirism, killing many people and draining their blood for sustenance in the process.I have no idea what Sony Pictures thinks they're doing with their Marvel properties. One minute it seems they want to keep everything to themselves with standalone films and the next they want to collaborate alongside Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe with Spider-Man. All these strange eschewed timelines make for confusing viewing for casual audiences and fans who cannot make heads or tails of where each of these films fit into which canon storyline. Like the two ""Venom"" films before it, ""Morbius"" is another attempt by Sony to introduce a Spider-Man villain by giving them their own solo film but it fails in practically every way possible.Once again, this film has fallen victim to the dreaded PG-13 rating handicap. This is especially frustrating since the main character is a vampire, a legendary creature who drinks the blood of the living for nourishment. Scenes that could have left a visceral impact on the viewer have clearly been watered down to fit the confines of its assigned rating. For example, whenever Morbius picks up someone and sink his fangs into their neck, the camera cuts away before we can be shown any gory detail. If the film were R rated, this could have been a great opportunity to demonstrate the horrific powers the main character has acquired by showing the bloody aftermath from the destruction they are causing. Instead, all these moments were merely implied or glossed over.Another thing that bothered me greatly was how unnecessarily dark the film was. No, I don't mean dark as in thematically, I mean the literally dark screen. Half the time I was squinting during the action scenes just to make out what was even happening. For moments that are inside Morbius's laboratory, it made sense for it to be dark but why did the filmmakers decide to use that exact same dim tinting during parts set outside in broad daylight? I get that he's technically a vampire and that he has an aversion to sunlight but not every single scene in the movie needs to reflect this. In a good movie like ""The Batman"", darkness is used as a storytelling element to show how the hero uses it to his advantage to hunt down his enemies. In a bad movie like this one, it only hampers the entire visual experience, making it very ugly to look at.The film also has some of the worst editing I've ever seen in a superhero movie. Everything is so chaotically paced it's near impossible to become invested in anything long term. Yet despite its breakneck speed and relatively short runtime (104 minutes), the film is surprisingly boring most of the way through. Perhaps it's the overall lack of interesting moments or the underdeveloped characters but nothing in this film left any major impression on me. It's a shame because I like the idea of a character like Morbius gaining his vampiric powers through genetic engineering instead of via the supernatural because it could have made for a more interesting exploration into potentially introducing vampires into a new Marvel timeline. But instead all we get from it is a few brief moments of exposition intercut with an arbitrary action scene saturated by a dark screen where it's hard to see anything. To add insult to injury, most of the action contains ""shaky-cam"" which makes an already badly shot movie look even more badly shot.I can't help but feel sorry for poor Jared Leto. He just doesn't seem to have much luck when it comes to appearing in superhero films. His version of the Joker in the DC Extended Universe is one many would rather forget (save for his scene in Zack Snyder's Justice League) and now I'm sure many would prefer to overlook his take on Morbius as well. To Leto's credit though, he at least looks like he's trying his best with the terrible material he has to work with, which is a task easier said than done. Sadly, there's not much here worth salvaging, as the script he has to work with is dead on arrival.Another actor who goes to waste along with him is Matt Smith as the antagonist Milo. Like Leto, Smith is also working hard to bring out as much entertainment value from his character as he can, but he is constantly bogged down by the film's worst traits. In the brief moments Leto and Smith were interacting, I could feel that there was some fleeting chemistry between them that could have made for some great dialogue scenes. But I guess the filmmakers thought the audience wouldn't care and decided to insert more badly shot and edited action scenes to pad things out.Even with my low expectations, ""Morbius"" still managed to disappoint me even more than I had imagined. Worst of all, the film isn't even bad in the cheesy fun sense; it's just a boringly forgettable experience. All the potential was there for them to have made at least a semi-decent origin story surrounding this character but without focus and passion (you know, the most important things required to tell a story in the first place) it all fell apart embarrassingly. The film is already failing both critically and commercially so hopefully this will serve as a wakeup call to the people at Sony. If you want to watch good Marvel movies featuring vampires, then watch the first two ""Blade"" films starring Wesley Snipes as they still hold up pretty well today (don't bother too much with ""Trinity"" though). As for this one, if you value your time and money, avoid it at all costs.I rate it 3/10.",Notr

The Amazing Spider-Man had good bits, and Venom was fun, but Morbius experience came across as a chore.I thought Jared Leto wasn't bad, and actually held himself back a bit (unlike say Tom Hardy who went all out with Venom).

It will make you feel a powerful range of emotions which you have never felt before. You will laugh, and you will cry. You will rage, and you will fear. You will be sick to your stomach. You will ultimately feel a satisfaction unmatched by that which you have already experienced. Morbius is more than just a movie. It's a personal experience. The characters were realistic and beautifully written. I felt like I knew them. Nay; I KNEW them. While I was watching the film, I considered them my closest friends. Their struggles, although foreign, were also relatable. As I watched them overcome their fears and their prejudices in order to save the day, they taught me that I, too, could be the hero. It made me rethink everything I thought I knew about society, heroism, and morality. This movie is truly a miracle. It cured my cancer, fed my starving children, and brought my grandmother back to life. Daniel Espinosa (the wonderful director of this film) is more than a filmmaker. He is a PROPHET. Mere words cannot express how thankful I am for the existence of his masterpiece. Thanks to Espinosa, we finally have an answer to the age-old question. God is real, and He is Morbius. 100/10 stars.",Notr
890,"Morbius Review-
Minor SpoilersPros:
1. Entertaining. This film is only 1 hour and 44 minutes long and goes by pretty fast. The first half of the movie is definitely better than the rest. I was surprised it actually has some cool parts and Dr. Michael Morbius is a kind-hearted person deep down and has elements that reminded me of Eddie Brock. I definitely need an oversized pajama shirt of Morbius's scary face on it now! His character I think has potential.2. Martine Bancroft. The main female character Dr. Martine Bancroft is a colleague of Dr. Morbius and in the comics becomes his fiancé. She brings cool female touch to the horror of this movie, I ended up liking her character.In comparison to Venom's Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) Martine (Adria Arjona) is a cooler better supporting character and a lot more loyal. Okay yes and she also has a cat (which Morbius lets hang around).3. The 2 mid credit scenes. The theater that I was in, like smart Marvel fans, stayed around for the credits and it was the moment that people cheered. I won't go into details with what they were but it was awesome! It definitely is part of the other Marvel universes.Cons:
1. The villain. Matt Smith who is supposedly a good actor in other films SUCKED in this (no pun intended). In my personal opinion he is what dragged this movie down. Jared Leto is apparently a better actor than Matt Smith, at least in this film. His character Milo has a scene that is about as cringeworthy as Venom dancing in the club in Let there be Carnage.2. A lot of CGI. There are a lot of scenes of CGI and fight scenes that kind of make the movie lame because of the floating weird aura around them as they move. When Dr. Morbius goes full vampire, as he looks in the photo, he looks super creepy and awesome but most of the time him and his villain don't look that cool, and of course very fake.3. Some things didn't add up. I was a little bit confused as to how his origin begins. There is a scene where Dr. Michael is standing in front of the bat cave with his bloody hand out, but then another seen where he's injecting himself with the ""cure"". It took me a minute to realize which one happened first and then later. Also there's another scene which I didn't like regarding him and Martine (I won't go into details for spoilers) but I understood it later. There were some scenes that definitely needed help.If you love dark perfect-for-Halloween type films you will enjoy this. It has its moments where it's like Venom, but not as cool or endearing. If you pass on it I understand, it's not Marvel's best, but for the Marvel boys, go judge it for yourself.For the record, Jared Leto is not in any way like the Joker at all in this movie. It lacks a lot but for a Halloween movie it's cool. 6.5/10.",Notr

I feel though the cgi for the faces couldve been better, but that aside it was not half bad. Everyones favourite vampire plays morbius. Jared leto. Having previouse played joker in the rival studios film he was more enjoyable in this and took on the role well. Milo his friend is played by matt smith, who I also enjoyed. Martine played by adria arjona was also someone that I thought was ok and I like the possibility of a sequal to this movie. Overall pretty good.",Notr

Do not get me wrong, I know the public doesn't agree with my opinion. But if they would just give it a chance, they would see that it is actually a 21st century masterpiece. If I could bring back the founding fathers from the dead and show them one thing from present day media, I would show them this movie.

900,"Morbius was by no means any masterpiece. It was pretty forgettable over all, especially the action sequences, which isn't a good sign for an action movie, and throughout things just happened with no to very little build up and the few characters we had got very little in terms of development or explaining their relationships, and then it just kinda ended without me being ready for it.That said I was never really bored in the theatre. It was an interesting enough premise, I understood the motivations and it kept a pretty straight line throughout. None of these actors are gonna win any Oscars for their work on this movie, but unlike some others I had no problem with any performance. Over all an OK night at the theatre and I would rather re-watch this than anything Disney/Marvel had put out post Far from home, except No Way Home, and even that isn't super good IMO, it's just special to watch because of all the returning actors.

The plot reads like a recipe gone horribly wrong: mix in a dash of blood illness, sprinkle some vampire bats, and voila! You've got yourself a recipe for disaster.The acting is so over the top that even the bats would be jealous of the hammy performances. Jared Leto's transformation into a vampire is so believable, I almost thought I was watching a documentary on ""How Not to Cure a Blood Condition."" And don't get me started on the FBI agents who seem to have mastered the art of deducing everything except how to properly investigate a crime scene.But the real star of the show? The bats, of course! They're not just your average bats; they're Michael's furry companions, and they're here to save the day. Move over, Batman, there's a new winged vigilante in town!

By the end of it you barely remember anyone's name or purpose. They are written so minimally and dull-like that by the end of it you end up not really caring that much for them.

904,"After countless delays and pushed back premiere dates, Morbius has finally hit the big screen, sadly without much interest or fanfare. Even worse, without many favorable reviews from critics. I was having second thoughts about going, but I had purchased my ticket a few weeks back. After all, for me an opportunity to take in a new Marvel film in the theater isn't something to bypass lightly. Not really knowing what I was in for, I grabbed my movie bag and venture to my favorite theater to see what's what.Other than the few trailers I'd seen beforehand, I went into Morbius cold, never having read any of the comics and being completely unfamiliar with the character. I can't say anything about how the film holds up to ""canon"" as a result. I can say that Morbius the film is a straight up origins film and for my time and money a fairly solid one at that. I've definitely seen much worse.While there's no deep dive into the character of Michael Morbius but we're given enough info (though some of it's vague) as to who he is, his motivations, and the type of person he is to make the film work. Morbius is heavily CGI, most of it well executed and effective, there is some overuse as well that becomes campy, but again nothing that's a detriment to the overall film viewing experience. The same holds true with the prosthetics as well, particularly in the case of Matt Smith's Milo (there a couple of scenes that made me laugh-out-loud when I shouldn't have).Morbius is stunningly atmospheric and has plenty of good action, nice touches of humor, and humanity. A strong cast does there best and gives it there all to their credit. Due to the runtime of an hour fort-four minutes the character development is limited but leaves enough of an impression to want to see where they go next. The ending is also anticlimactic as a result as well. Quite abrupt to say the least.Predictability/formulaic is also present, yet the film remains interesting and entertaining nonetheless. It's also clear that given the subject/plot that an R-Rated film would've been a better choice for this one than going the PG-13 route. Tempering the blood and violence to get the more kid friendly rating definitely impacted the handling of the film and toning it down didn't do anyone any favors.From my viewpoint, Morbius isn't the greatest but it most certainly isn't the worse either. I was intrigued, never bored, an entertained the entire film. Yes, there are questions I have and holes that I want filled but I'm glad I went and saw it on the big screen. I most certainly want to see what's next for the characters/franchise as well. Do you NEED to see this one at the theater? No, waiting for a home viewing will probably work just as well. But, if you WANT to see it on the big screen, I say go for it. It's a fun little popcorn flick that doesn't deserve the haterade being thrown at it in my opinion.Morbius gets a 7 from me.Oh, don't bolt right away, you get a couple of credit scenes.",Notr

But what really shocked me was the closing credits or end credits (list of the cast and crew of a particular motion picture not the ""post credit scenes""), the visual effects in those closing credits were AMAZING, I can't express how much an amazing experience those closing credits were, for the first time in my life I didn't want them to end.Finally the post credit scene, not to spoil anything I'm just gonna say they were great opening the door for something special.",Notr

We get to see a few CGI fight scenes, and while the color scheme of most of the important scenes is too dark and hard to see, I found myself unimpressed by the fake smoke that billows behind Morbius and Milo. Where's that smoke coming from? Is something burning? A movie with a shallow story and lifeless dialogue, disconnected scenes, bland characters and no message. Look at Jared's expression, he looks too naive and innocent for this role. Maybe he should have focused on changing the muscles in his face instead of his body. I don't know what Vulture is here for, but from the trailer, he seems to be a bait to get money from people.",Notr

It's like the final act of the film was never filmed.And with that everything that looked cool about the movie was cut. Vulture narrated the trailer and he's basically not in the film. Jokes are left literally incomplete.No part of this movie is memorable other than what has already been memed to death.Plus the end credits scenes are so insanely illogical and near canon breaking.As someone who was actually excited for this movie, I am not just incredibly disappointed but I've lost all hope in the Venomverse.",Notr

The ""story"" moves very quickly and I felt like I was just thrown into a scenario that I had no background knowledge of. Some good things about this movie though is the final battle.

In the last 20 minutes it looked like they wouldn't know how to end it and stuff it with action to make an excuse of it. After that the last cheesy parts were unbearable. No! I don't like that.

Jared Leto is Michael Morbius a biochemist who is always working on the latest medical discoveries and ,all of a sudden his life changes when he is affected by some rare blood.

Matt Smith on the other hand, is easily the sole standout element, completely over the top and clearly enjoying it with a dance Bully Maguire would be proud of.The CG is extremely messy and distracting, especially in the final fight which is almost completely incomprehensible. The action overall is competently shot but lacks any real weight or impact.

Vampire powers.It's basically a combination of all the superhero and Vampire movies we've already seen. Except with terrible action scenes that you can't make out for all the bats and rubble that are in the way. As well as repetitive use of annoying slow motion, and people's faces quickly morphing into a Vampire face mid sentance. Just to remind you that the film isn't boring. There's even a forced unnecessary romance in there for no reason.It could of at least been average and is almost saved by the decent villian.

Pleasantly surprised, leave your biased opinions at home and just watch it for what it is and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Big plus that it's under 2 hours so it didn't drag anything out.

to fix the part of himself that's broken.

In a last ditch effort to save not only his life, but the life of his best friend Milo (and the lives of countless other people who suffer from the same disease),, Michael creates a serum by using cells from a vampire bat, and injects the serum into himself via the spine (not exactly legal, so he does this on a cargo ship over international waters).The serum works in ways far better than Michael could've imagined. He now has the physique and strength of a top olympian athlete, and feels more alive than ever,, but Michael quickly discovers other, less spectacular side effects from the serum. He now has an uncontrollable hunger for blood.Human, blood.Now,, the real problem with this movie isn't that it's bad (really,, it's not that bad),, it's that it could've been really great if it had been written better and had better direction. It should've been rated R, for starters. The cast is really good, and it certainly had a big enough budget to be great,, it just lacks in the writing and direction, imo. If you watch it, you'll see that there is too much needless CGI, and there is also too much off screen stuff that should've been on-screen. Anyways,, I'd give it a 6.5 rating.

He like a mere mortal put on this earth saw what even cosmic being couldn't interpret.Morbius changed my life. It opened my eyes to unknown secrets of life. The journey of Dr. Morbius is relatable and I could feel myself being him in those situations (of course when reality striked, I could never be him but it felt good to imagine being as great a person as Michael Morbius). If there were ever a renaissance to occur I believe this movie would start it, and arguably it already has.So it's no surprise it instantly became the highest grossing movie of all time in the span of just 1 month. Everything about this film is surreal and artistic. Don't make the mistake of thinking that just because it's a comic book movie is generic because it's far from it. I can attest that no comic book movie would ever come close to Morbius, not even The Dark Knight.One of the best scenes to ever grace the history cinema was Matt Smith's character, Milo, dance scene. It was encompassed almost everything that is right with 21st century cinema.Words fail me now to describe the art piece I witnessed. It's a shame we had to wait 3 years for Morbius to arrive because I think if it had come before pandemic, it would've stopped pandemic from ever occurring because Morbius puts the virus to shame. It would be afraid to ever infect a crowd of Morbius devotees. Praise Morbius.I don't read comics now, neither do I watch any other movie than Morbius. I have devoted my life to Morbius.

It really isn't that bad. It does of course have flaws. It's low budget was obvious in it's many scenes of cgi, acting was cringe at times, some horrible humor and lines, and some of the cinematography was a little bizarre to me. Also, it suffered from a short runtime that made it so that characters weren't fleshed out as much as they could've been. But with all it's flaws, it was still a fun and entertaining film. The cgi may have been odd a lot of the time, but still looked like a really cool video game. Some of the effects (especially when flying or fighting) were pretty cool. The actors felt like they were dedicated to their parts, even with some weird lines. The dynamic between Leto and Smith was fantastic as well. This origin story was a tad generic, but I feel like MCU fans should be okay with that by now. Overall it definitely had flaws, but is nowhere near as bad as critics and certain MCU fans are trying to make it out to be. Give it a watch and judge for yourself.",Notr

To be honest though, most of the movie was unnecessary. It was a cool idea, but it was boring, and aside from a few cool scenes, it's completely forgettable. There's so much to keep up with and so much that doesn't make sense, so it's just killing itself from scene to scene. The after credits were rough, and let in some pretty big potholes. The fight scenes are messy, and while creative, definitely not outstanding. And the character deaths that were included to make the story more interesting were stupid and angering. This entire movie was just a mess. If there ever is a second one, there's gonna be quite a bit to clean up.",Notr

I found the first half boring and when it finally picked up it was intersting for a moment when he first changed and was trying to figure things out. Then it took an even more boring turn when the cops soon got involved and he did not want to change at all. I wanted to see him own it. Be a vampire, find yourself in it. Use it for good or bad. But running away from it was annoying. There was no feelings or chemistry in th love story. It felt thrown in. And the whole relationship brother thing didn't flow nicely either.

Yes it could've been at least 15 minutes longer with more action scenes, but for a Sony/Marvel movie they did a great job and was up to pare with their other movie Venom. I believe this movie deserves a lot better ratings then what it's receiving and I definitely believe it's worth the watch.",Notr

I thought it was going to be one of those instant cult classics: So bad it becomes remembered in movie history.Turns out, the movie is not bad at all. I was literally looking for the part that must have generated all that hate and couldn't figure it out. And I am usually a pretty harsh critic.This movie isn't a great master piece, the biggest issue being that you won't care much about the characters. The CGI is fine and the directing is fine and the writing is fine. As for the acting, I can't really tell: The main character doesn't show much personality, but I can't tell if that's on purpose or if it's bad acting on Leto's part. (There is a reason the character might be closed off emotionally.)Still, the movie is better than 90% of the Marvel junk that Disney is putting out. The Guardians of the Galaxy was an amazing movie, but its sequel was some of the dumbest writing I've ever seen. Yet it has 7.6 rating? I can only assume this is about loyalty to the characters. Similarly, ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" deserves a 5.5 with its sloppy writing, sloppy conflict creation and sloppy conflict solution. Yet it has an 8.2 currently, most likely because of the familiar faces they bring in around the second half of the movie.All in all Morbius was an enjoyable movie and a fun way of creating a vampire super hero. It won't leave you with any profound impression, but it is better than most of the super hero movies out there.",Notr

At the end it felt like a cliff hanger where none of the characters are fully developed, especially the detectives, Martine and Nicholas, even Mobius himself. Milo has the best arc.

There was this huge focus on charactever development for the first part of the movie (the part I was able to watch). And there was no emotional connection, partially due to the sound effect work, and partially due to being, well, uninteresting.Third problem. I tried to play with my phone for the rest of the film after becoming bored and kinda grossed out. But the video and sound editing were seemingly disruptive by design. I wasn't completely sure anymore, but the scenes seemed to cut into each other with the audio bleeding over from the next scene before the camera cuts.Fourth problem. The audio itself was absolutely gnarly. I didn't want to hear it.

Why would they get close to him in action and not show anything???Instead we get to see him fly around the city.The antagonist was a mess, he had no motivation, no background of being this evil guy he was portrayed as.He just woke up one day and chose violence.There were many insignificant side characters that added nothing to the story.",Notr

Snore. The problem with this movie is that it takes itself extremely seriously. It's about a biochemist named Michael Morbius who tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but instead, he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism.It hurts my heart to give a Marvel movie a bad grade because I'm normally such a huge fan, but I just couldn't get into this one. It's directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless.Marvel is magic, but Sony didn't capture it this time around.THINGS I LIKED:
I really like Jared Leto and am sincerely happy for him to be given this comic book character to bring to life. He's extremely talented and really works hard to introduce us to this interesting character.Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Tyrese Gibson, and Al Madrigal flesh out the cast and all do a fine job.The New York City scenes were actually filmed in Manchester, England. Weird, right? They had to change all of the street signs and license plates and could have saved some time if they had just filmed in the Big Apple. They also did that in the movie Captain America: The First Avenger.Marvel fans will be able to spot a lot of Easter eggs and tie-ins from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Watch Matt Smith's character carefully and you'll even spot some similarities to Jim Carrey's character in the movie The Mask.There are some cool special effects.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The plot wanders around. Snore. I just didn't care about the characters or the story.The constant beating score is heavy-handed and exhausting.There's some action, but mostly a lot of smoldering anger and talking.Lots of CGI and not much we haven't already seen a million times before.So much exposition.The characters are thin and underdeveloped.Spiderman? Venom? They both capture the whimsical humor needed to balance out the serious drama. Morbius completely forgot about that successful formula.The movie isn't that long but feels like it. I was bored within minutes.The fighting and action scenes are just a big jumbled mess so that you can't really see what's happening.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

Not the fault of the actors, they did well, however the script, made no sense, it made absolutely no sense, there was a total absence of character development here.

When there are scare scenes they do look scary if they are effective.Now my negatives. Matt Smith's performance in the movie can be over the top and weird seeing in a movie like this, I only believed that him and Morbius were friends.The villain was predictable and the movie has plot holes leading to scenes that don't make sense, even the ending was a little confusing.The action scenes moved too fast and were hard to see, especially with all the CGI they have for the looks of the vampires. Only rarely you will get a clear shot, but it's mostly shaky cam.The mid-credit scenes are confusing when it comes to the Spider-Man universe, and it made me wonder why they are doing all of this to something already setup and without any motivation in why it is happening.I would re-watch this to see if I can understand it more in what it is trying to do in connecting with other Marvel universes.But I found this movie mostly mediocre.

Their friendship can truly be felt as if it two real friends were going through turmoil.The soundtrack of Morbius were like the final bells ringing the end of school, every sound and each song is carefully crafted to convey the most captivating emotion, each symphony forcefully releases dopamine from my mind and I can not get enough of this film. To match this, CGI constructed to such perfection that it brought tears to my eyes every single instance Morbius would 'morb out' and go savage on his enemies, his ability to carefully plan out strategies and execute them flawlessly, clearly connotes an ability that would rival the likes of Thanos.Narrative, never in my existence have I sat through 104 minutes of pure bliss, everything makes sense, everything happens for a reason, and everything has consequences.

This movie tried to balance the two and missed the mark by a little. It's not a huge miss but I would have liked to see more of the beginning and definitely more of the action. And it was clear who was going to be the bad guy right from the start. Not a huge deal but not a surprise when it was revealed.What I didn't like was the smokey colors that trailed after them when they were ""moving fast"". I guess that was there was to highlight they were fast moving. It's certainly not that they become misty when moving or at least I do not remember that.My one big issue that will be mainly for the part 2. Is Morbius' bite could make other people become pseudo vamps like him without his powers. They did not indicate this happened to any of the previous victims. Only one of them woke up and if they try and make that person powerful that will be a big let down. In fact, the origin of that one would be different than the original origin of that character. But who knows...With the multiverse thing going on they could have had different stories that lined up with this.That's the real reason they did the multiverse...That way they can redo anything they want and say ""hey, it's not the same"".

The acting was actually pretty decent; I'm not saying it was awesome, but the actors did the best with what they were given and much scenery was chewn.The problem is that this would have made an awesome 1990s B-Movie: The SFX were pretty good, but too heavily dependent on the CGI when practical effects, including prosthetics, would have done better. The lighting was good, but too geared towards spooky and atmospheric when realistic lighting would have been much more effective.There were some stand-out effects, such as the trails and the echolocation effects, but this was more of a throwback to the early SciFi movies (before it was Syfy) and was more appropriate to something from the Asylum than the MCU.The writing was hardcore 1990s, however. The science had nothing to do with anything in the real world; the Technobabble knob was set on high and they did not hold back. You should not use anything you see here to help someone, including the legal stuff.

If you like Marvel movies and you aren't a self hating nitpicker, you will like this movie. Could've been better but still good. The special effects weren't bad. The acting was high quality.

1009,"The first half hour of the movie, well, the story starts with a good plot, good reasons why dr. Morbius leads him to do what he does, however, as the movie progresses it gets worse, until he crashes. An exaggerated use of cgi that clashes with the aesthetics of the film, the character development is empty, the basic motivations, the dialogues practically a couple of sentences in one scene, a couple of sentences in another... the beginning of the film, i was enjoying it, but when it was over, I didn't know what to think... I don't know if many scenes were removed in the edition, or because of the problems of the pandemic it was not possible to record everything that was wanted, but this film lacked in many scenes, lack of development of the characters, it lacked a better integration of the logic of how the elements of the film worked... in general it is an entertaining film, but it becomes ridiculous at times. I feel sorry for the final result of this one, because Jared Letto's performance is quite good, but the others are bad, especially the female partner of Dr. Morbius, a basic action, with simplistic motivations and without deep development of these. Honestly, I think it could have been a good movie, but it just wasn't. Maybe in the future the director's cut will come out and we'll see what we deserved, but for now it's just one more of the bunch... I recommend going to see it if there isn't much else to do, and you don't go with a critical attitude, but if you want to see one good movie, better stay home.",Notr

There is no resemblance here to a superhero, and even if there were, story is abandoned in favour of makeup and special effects and a repulsive visage.

1020,"This will be a relatively generous rating and review. The main reason being, that it really was not any worse than 'Venom', and it was better than 'Venon: Let there be Carnage'. A 6.5/10 would seem about right.There's not much to make this origin story stand out. What would have been nice is if they made Michael Morbius have a Greek accent, or at least have a larger portion of the film take place in Greece, instead of New York, which is the setting for almost every other comic movie. Even in the beginning, why don't they have young Morbius, who is in Greece, speak Greek? Other than that I thought they stayed pretty true to his character, and that Jared Leto actually did an alright job.Lots of complaints about the CGI, but again, it seemed no worse than the CGI in 'Venom', and in some ways it was probably better. It's problem was an over abundance and over reliance. All the action is CGI, and so the movie is completely saturated with it. Perhaps with this type of character it may be hard to avoid, but that seemed to be one of it's main issues.This movie also didn't seem overly necessary. It's a story that could have easily been part of Spider-Man film, and didn't necessarily seem like it needed to be a stand alone. Not to say that's a bad thing, we've just seen these origin stories told in pretty much every other Spider-Man film. Brilliant scientist involved in an experiment that goes wrong and gets turned into some kind of monster... this happens a lot.What was good? The acting seemed good, even if the characters lacked depth. And... I liked the closing credits; not the post credit scenes, but the actual initial credits design and music. Am I reaching now?Not much else to say. It's by no means as bad as the reviews say, but I get it. It's just kinda bland and generic, but still provides entertainment, so I suppose that's the end goal.",Notr
1021,"I'm not sure what the magic touch that Marvel has is, but whatever it is, it's certainly not rubbing off on Sony when they try and make a film without them. Two disappointing ""Venom"" films are followed by this one about Spider-man's Vampiric sometime foe, sometime friend that looked like a shaky proposition a long way out. That it's not as bad as some reviews have made out is about the best I can say.Having been born with a debilitating and life limiting blood condition, Doctor Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has spend his life trying to find a cure. Coming to believe that the answer lies in the DNA of Vampire Bats, Morbius tests his experimental serum on himself. Though he is cured, even given superhuman abilities, his rational mind is only sated by the consumption of blood - human or synthetic. Struggling with his curse, he refuses to give the cure to his long-time friend and benefactor Milo (Matt Smith), but when he takes it anyway, Milo finds he has less qualms about taking a life.It's not awful, but it's not good either. Like it's ""Venom"" stablemates before it, it is a CGI heavy superhero film that feels behind the times. Not investing enough in the story of the film and assuming that brand name recognition and a tiny bit of spectacle will be enough to get people in. Leto's sleepwalks through the role a bit, though Matt Smith, and Jared Harris as their defacto father get a bit more to do. Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal appear as two special agents, but their contributions to the plot are so limited they could have been cut entirely. In fact, they do just disappear from the film after a while.To get slightly more specific about my problems with the plot, I feel like Morbius and Milo fall out too quickly, once they're both Vampires. That the romantic relationship was unearned and the less said about the post credits scenes and their baffling look into the future the better.I feel like Sony could do with a little more quality in their creative teams, maybe a few more gambles with types of directors and writers their choosing for their projects.

1024,"Morbius (2022) :
Movie Review -Marvel means superhero. But is it completely true? Can Marvel be something different too? Yes, it can be. Can it be something related to vampires? Yes. Here's Morbius to give you all the answers. You see, this concept of failed experiments (of scientists or doctors) or side effects of experiments is way too old in Hollywood. James Whale made some iconic films like Frankenstein (1931), ""The Invisible Man"" (1933) and ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935) with this formula in the horror genre. George Waggner followed Whale's footprints and made ""The Wolf Man"" (1941).Those early experiments were shocking to the audience in that era because Hollywood was establishing new genres then. But the same stuff became old and cliched with films like ""Hallow Man"" (2000), ""Spider Man"" (2002), ""Hulk"" (2003) and a few others. Some films used the formula of a failed experiment to show the good guys, while some used it for the bad ones. Spider Man 3 came with that Venom thing, which showed us two characters being haunted by the same supernatural power, and recently we saw a Malayalam superhero flick, ""Minnal Murali,"" (2021) with the same thought. Marvel's Morbius is quite similar to these two films. But it has a damn boring plot and a predictable twist that just doesn't survive.In the film, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease with the help of his girlfriend and fellow doctor, Martine (Adria Arjona), but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead. He is blessed with enormous powers, but he doesn't know how to control them. Is it a gift or a curse? His surrogate brother, Milo (Matt Smith), shows him the other side of this new invention, which creates differences between them. Who will win in the end? A good vampire or an evil one? The second half of Morbius provides you with all the answers, and believe me, there is nothing unpredictable or new here.Marvel films are usually not dark, but this one is an exception. I don't need to explain what happens when Marvel tries something dark and intense. The fans don't expect them to make such films. They just want entertainment and larger-than-life characters with screaming heroic acts, not a story. With Morbius, Marvel fans get neither of them. Morbius is not a superhero film, actually. It just ends up being a superhero flick, somehow. A vampire drama is nothing new for us. From ""The Golem"" (1920), ""Nosferatu"" (1922), ""Dracula"" (1931), and many other well-known horror films and TV shows (in every industry across the world), the idea just doesn't change. Then how can Morbius be an exception? It just happens to be dropped in the wrong universe and at the wrong time, that's all.Jared Leto has been impressive in the last 5-6 years, with some good acting credits to his name. So, Morbius was a simple task for him because VFX did the majority of the work for him. Well, this is not just the acting-driven role he deserves, but he's fine with whatever acting-loaded scenes he has got. Matt Smith is surprising, though. His character comes as a surprise, and that's still digestible, I should say, but his performance too comes as a surprise, and that's a pleasant surprise, I must say. The gorgeous looking Adria Arjona hasn't got too many long scenes, but whenever she appears, she makes sure that you notice her presence. Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson's support is strictly okay.Morbius is full of colourful visuals. It looks unnecessary and illogical as the colour themes and that foggy smoke behind the vampires don't really make any sense, but don't know why, the screen appeal carries it through. It doesn't bore, and that's too much, but the screenplay does. Also, the fighting scenes are shot from close angles - putting a lot of strain on your eyes for some time. Nevertheless, a few of them are brilliantly shot, and indeed, they entertain you. However, a little more practical sense would have only helped.Morbius' mediocrity is not limited to the writing, but also reflects on Daniel Espinosa's outdated vision. Come on man, I mean, it's 2022, not 1982 to show so much repetitiveness on screen. Espinosa's directional techniques drain all the blood out of Morbius' body. Somehow, the soul survives due to Marvel's comic tale. Rest, it's a strictly below-average show saved by some breathtaking action sequences and somewhat pleasant visual effects. Don't expect anything more than that, not even a penny, because if you do, Morbius will suck all your blood during those 106 minutes. Overall, an underwhelming Gothic tale with uneven Marvel stamping all over. SKIP IT!RATING - 4/10*",Notr

1053,"The Make Up/Effects at Points:
When they are investing and putting effort into the movie, the effects are not bad in Morbius. While not really achieving what Disney has perfected, there are times where the pale, emaciated figure of Morbius is rather shocking to see and I applaud the ability to make his disease look realistic. Once the vampiric powers start to arise, there are times where the effects are looking pretty cool, and hold some edge of cool for me in the way they designed the transformation features. Seeing his eyes transform into this blind like state was my particular fate, but other eye color changes, the warping of the face at times, and even the cool finger effects of his claws were elements I thought were done well for this film. It's again not the most unique or jaw dropping experience we've ever seen, but it works for me.The Special Effects:
Again, there is a lot of room for improvement, but at times Morbius manages to shake some things up for using technology to make some moments pretty cool. At the lower level of likes is the dash like speed force he has, managing to be actually fast, but not too slow-motion madness like Snyder likes. As more powers arise, there are some cool moments that help make you feel like you are in for the ride (like a virtual coaster), and the sonar is pretty cool in those opening moments. My favorite involves the use of critters, and the nice use of lighting and sound effects to really give you that element of dread, darkness and superhero abilities that we love to hear/see in the theater.The First Part of the Story:
There is a nice opening to this movie as the first act unfolds for Morbius' place in this crazy mixed up universe. A nice touching moment between the two main characters, some engaging medical drama moments that match other searches for the cure, and some other set ups got points for engagement for me in this film. If only that quality could have been kept for much of the film, but that opening showed great promise for this series.The First Action Scene:
It's not the most put together scene, but I did like the angle they took with the first fight on the boat. Morbius' dive into his powers leads to a predator like moment that held some dynamic angles and approaches to taking on the extras. A few first-person moments, mixed with fleeting glimpses of him in the shadows felt like a hardcore Batman Begins scene that works with this savage nature of Morbius' tale. It showed promise for the rest of the film, but that did not quite pan out.The Acting:
It's not the best by far, but there were moments where the actors were able to salvage some of the movie with performances that could have been capitalized on. Ariona is stunning on many levels, a combination of beauty, smarts, and spirit that makes for a more interesting supporting character for this film. She held a lot of the logic and goodness of the city, but always had the ability to challenge the rules that made her perfect to help with Morbius' plans. I'm going to skip over the other top billed actor due to their low involvement, but Matt Smith as Milo had moments that would have worked had they reigned some of the writing back. Smith's non intense moments do have some heart to it, and that first act again shows the promise of a complicated character. When he is forced to go to other extremes, there are times his mannerisms are perfect for the role, and other times a little too much. Still, I enjoyed the performance he brought to some degree. Leto is of course the star of the film, and he tried to do as much as he could with what he was given. Leto's first act is strong, and his second act is not bad, but there is just some missing direction or planning that gets lost to the weaknesses of the movie. Overall, there is some decent and good chemistry, but it's lost to a lot of other things in this movie.DISLIKES:The Weaker Acting Moments:
I never expect Oscar roles in these movies, but I've had enough quality to know stronger acting roles in a superhero movie. Morbius has a lot of shorthanded acting moments, many being cheesy, flat, or just ludicrous with the material given. As the movie progressed, the acting quality continued to worsen until it was just a messy finish that was humorous at times and lacking on others.The Writing:
I don't know what's up with the dialogue, but the movie's quality in lines also degrades over time. That strong start, engaging dialogue with realism and panache are practically absent at the end, and things just become very simplified and cut to be almost not needed by the end of the film. Other lines and attempts to be clever find their marks, but most are straight misses for this reviewer, lost to all the over-the-top visuals and lackluster second and third acts that have too much in them.The Comedy:
Is very limited for me to be honest. The movie's jokes have become stale from the multiple trailers that they have very little bite to them unless you have missed those trailers. Other jokes are very forced on you, and for me (and most of my audience members) did not generate too many intentional laughs. I hate to say that, but I just did not laugh as much as I have at other superhero movies in this film.The Action:
Sony used to be awesome with their superhero action, giving me those high-flying Spiderman moments that to this day still get me stoked for what they did. However, Morbius' darker atmosphere offered some chances to tear into the fighting again as he explored the nature of his powers. While some of these effects did accomplish this, much of the action was lame for me, quick bouts of overexaggerated moves that were over before they started. No coordination, no titanic displays of powers, just a few quick blurs into slow motion snarls don't make for the most entertaining battles for me. Throw some choreography, a bit of fun moves, and some other tropes and this could have worked. And as a plus, drop the Snydervision antics down a peg if possible.The Visual Effects: The Other side:
Some things look awesome and others are showing the limitations of Sony's group and the impact on budgets. I can't say it's the worst, because they can still do better than me, but the cheesy visuals dilute the vampiric mode they were striving to design. During the creature moments, prosthetics could have helped with this, while also tightening up the CGI to not look so fake and artificial. It's nothing that destroys the movie for the most part, but Disney again has proven their merit in this element.The Story:
This is the weakest element of the movie for me, and the part that I think weakness many of the other elements mentioned above. Morbius' first act actually is not bad, a little predictable, a few extra cut moments, but sets the stage for ethical dilemmas that will be tested in the coming hour and a half. And then comes the second act where suddenly things pick up pace, lots of elements are pushed in, action scenes get muddy, and build up/testing is rather low, dropping all that preparation. The movie tries to fight quality and speed at this point, and the thing that suffers is suspense and character utilization, which is very poor in this movie. Big name actors, and roles get various levels of showing up on screen, most of which feel very weak to the promise being made. Once the third act hits... the movie is rushing to not only wrap up this chapter with an ""exciting"" climax, but also set up for the next movie if they get greenlit. Unfortunately, this failed miserably for me and felt like a sweep under the rug. Unlike Venom, the after credits scene could not redeem the ending, and even these scenes don't quite make sense or have the punch I think was envisioned. Had the story been balanced and not as much crammed in, perhaps all these dislikes would be likes.The VERDICT:
Morbius is indeed one of the weaker installments of the Marvel series, and it all comes down to planning, writing and balance, which this movie lacks. Sure, there are moments that do work for me, the first act in particular being the strongest part, alongside some effects and fighting do work for me. The acting does its best with the material, but it can only do so much with what it was given, which is not much at times. Where the movie fails though is that the visual effects are lacking at times, alongside mundane action sequences that utilize little of the imagination Sony once held for their hero flicks. It's really the writing and story though that just have everything collapse, a rush mess that seemed to take hits with each delay, including the hasty wrap up and teasers that they are trying to lure you back in with for the sequel that may come. It's too much in one movie and it really pales in comparison to a lot of other things in this category. Thus, the effects may be the only worthy theater visit quality, while I give a strong nod to seeing this at home if you can.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Horror: 5.5
Movie Overall: 4.0-4.5.",Notr
1054,I'm not sure why this got slated as much as it did! I really enjoyed it. Yes there are better Marvel films out there but there are much worse ones too! I enjoyed this far more than The Eternals for example which bored me to tears. I also preferred this to Venom but know a lot of people loved that.I'm not usually a great fan of the Universal films side of Marvel as they don't seem to be great but for me this was done well and I hope that more films will come from it. This has been hinted at with the end credit scenes and I liked what they hinted at so fingers he returns in the Blade movies when they come out.,Notr
1055,"It seems there is a bit of a bandwagon against this film. It is not a great film but it is watchable.It starts off well but then drifts along, doesn't really go anywhere and then the ending is a bit weak.If you like marvel films I would watch it but with lower expectations.",Notr
1056,"I wonder why all the hate, and awful reviews of this movie? This was actually really good! Most of the bad reviews I read sounded like haters of either Jared Leto, or of the genre. If Marvel wants to try some horror to pull in new viewers, it works. I just watched it, and I don't watch ANY superhero flicks. Just not my thing. I don't hate on them, I just don't get the pull. Plus, it's really difficult to put together a good vampire, werewolf, or monster flick without worn out tropes and it coming off as cheesy and cliche. Anyhow, I liked it and I hope Marvel does more! Its also another movie that proves you should never trust online opinions, and just watch it for yourself.",Notr
1057,"I have been a fan of Marvel films since I was a kid and I always try to look for the good in them first, simply because I don't enjoy disliking them. When a superhero story is told very well, they're some of my favourite stories out there. When Sony began to branch out their Spider-Man universe and make villain films, I was very worried. I had some fun with both Venom films, but neither were great by any means. Well, the latest Sony/Marvel villain film, Morbius, has just hit the big screen, and it's not good, which is saying a lot coming from me.Trying to cure himself of a rare condition, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) discovers that there may be a cure hidden in the blood of bats. After injecting himself to find out, he morphs himself into some kind of vampire. From here, he begins to lose control, creating casualties along the way. His best friend Milo (Matt Smith) also has this condition, so I'm sure you can guess where the villain storyline comes into play here. So now that you have the just of the premise, let's dive in.Firstly, I'm not going to ignore the elements that worked for me overall. I'll admit that this is the best I've seen from Jared Leto in a while and the chemistry he shared with Martine (Adria Arjona) was absolutely a highlight of the film. The tone suits what's going on and I enjoyed the look of it overall, but the tone and slow pacing eventually grind the film to a halt on a few occasions. I'm also all for a darker hero/anti-hero story in the Marvel universe because we haven't had much of that, but there just wasn't enough of a good story being told to back that up. There was an effort here, it just didn't work for me.So, why didn't this film work? Well, I was instantly turned off by the first scene, as the discovery of the bats is literally the opening sequence. Just a couple of scenes later he's already injecting himself and the cure begins to work. It's almost like the first act of the film was condensed to five minutes. Moving along, there are many scenes of dialogue that drag on, while the important plot points seem to be brushed over as bullet points. Morbius is so focused on getting to the good stuff, but it's sacrificing its characters in the process. On top of not really caring about what was going on, the finale just felt like another CGI fight that lasts for about 20 minutes. Those sequences can be tolerable or even great if they're part of a good film, but I just found myself rolling my eyes this time.In the end, Morbius is a film that takes place in the same world as Venom (maybe?) and Spider-Man (maybe?), but I was too confused with the conclusion of the film to really know where it takes place. I'd almost say it takes place in its own world. Morbius is a movie that clearly feels tampered with in post-production, and not in a good way. I do like Jared Leto as this character so I will gladly sit through a film that includes him, but I really don't care to see a series of films based solely on Morbius. Once the credits rolled I had no desire to recommend it to anyone and I can't see myself revisiting it, unless necessary. Morbius, even with low expectations on my part, sadly disappointed me.",Notr
1058,"Remember Venom (2018)? Remember how it had characters with almost no distinct traits or charismatic screen presence?

I will not watch it again.I wouldn't waste your time but there are a lot of mixed reviews on here so it is personal preference by the looks of it.

It's not going to break many records (if any), but it was enjoyable to see a relatively unknown Marvel character come to the big screen. The visuals were more B+, Jared Leto did great, I didn't care for Tyreses character, and the villain was a throw away, but the battles were fun and the story was decent. I liked the Easter eggs and cameos and I'd be happy to see Morbius again in future movies. I gave it a 7/10 and am happy I saw it.",Notr

The build up to the finale was great, the execution could have used another pass through the editor.Tl;dr it's fine, but the ending isn't polished.",Notr

I simply also have no words to describe the validity and awesomeness of this film, just as this film has no end. Not literally, this film has no end, no end to its awesomenes and genius. The screenwriters left us with no end in principle, so that we would be speechless (which happened to me too), forever trapped in the abyss of the time continuum in the endless temptation of this film, until we become one with it, until we become ""MORBIUS""!! ! This movie is a typical example of CINEMA, which doesn't need a sequel to satisfy our hunger for more viewing of new scenes. And I liked the song that says ""have s*x"" the most.

1065,"As a Marvel fan, I must word my disappointment, for the movies and series they are producing nowadays are ever so dull. Yet that doesn't apply to Morbius. It's immensely more enjoyable than most marvel movies. I watched it in sync with (thor, iron man 2 and 3, captain America civil war, thor love and thunder, the avenger's age of Ultron, and all marvel new series.) and it hands down outshone them all. The story is captivating yet the writers didn't handle it properly. And to be fair the cast merits a round of applause for their remarkable performances considering what they had to work with. Especially Jared Leto and matt smith. They were both beyond amazing, I believed every sentiment they conveyed. Jared is a wonderful actor who lures you in with his realistic and original ways. Not to mention that he's a lot like Morbius in real life which deemed him a perfect fit.The movie could've been a blockbuster if they had given it the same attention they usually bestow upon other marvel movies for they pale in comparison if not for the sometimes poor CGI and rushed writingThe reviews are utterly driven by unreasonable hatred and personal preferences that are irrelevant to the movie and its events.",Notr

The first half isn't terrible, but the second half just drags on and on while limping to its lackluster climax. There's a lot of unintentional comedy too.Add in the blatant copying of scenes and music from Batman Begins, and this film really irritated me.

I would have preferred prosthetics instead of the CGI faces because they looked really good for the first half, then turned so obviously fake by the second half, it was laughable. The CGI ""blurriness"" when the vampires would move looked terrible. I know it was suppose to represent the bat radar, but it was distracting. I also thought the detectives were pretty pointless to the story and could have been written to make some type of contribution for the climax of the movie.

The premise of the film sees a doctor try to cure himself of a blood disease but accidentally infects himself with Vampire Blood.Main Character
Jared Leto plays Michael Morbius and I really didn't like him in this role. He is obviously a good actor but between Morbius and The Joker, I think he should stay away from comic book roles for the rest of time. I don't think he is helped by other things going on but he is really bland and there is just no reason to care or support Morbius and that is a shame.Supporting Characters
Matt Smith plays Milo and he is so over the top that it is really cringe, but he is clearly really enjoying his screen time and giving it his all and he is the only person who can actually say this. His dynamic with Leto isn't particularly good but Smith has so much charisma that I couldn't stop watching it.Adria Arjona plays Martine Bancroft and is basically here just to give a romance for Morbius. She is a talented actress but she offers nothing here and she is one of the duller characters that you will meet in any comic book film.Jared Harris plays Emile Nicholas and I think he was okay here but he barely has any screen time. He feels like he is just a plot device for the story but I feel like Harris could have been a better part of the film and how he is used is a disappointment.Tyrese Gibson plays Simon Stroud and this might be the most offensive performance in the film. Gibson is mainly known for his energetic role in The Fast & Furious films but here he is so boring and monotone that it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him and he felt really out of place.Story
The story is all over the place. The ideas presented here could have worked but they tried to do them all together which meant they didn't work. The focus should have been more on the relationship between Morbius and Milo and I mean it should have been written a lot better but it has a romantic story and seeing Morbius against the police. The plot doesn't make much sense and is another low point for the film.Script
The script is also pretty bad, the drama didn't make me care about anybody in this film and the humour is super cringy. The blend of the two isn't handled well and the writing of the plot just makes no sense and it fits this films rubbish tone.Style
Now there are a few decent action scenes and I enjoyed the fact that it pushed the envelope for its 12 rating which I do appreciate. But a lot of the CGI is rubbish and some of the action scenes are lacklustre. The films pacing is all over the place too, it felt really long even though it is actually a normal length film.Overall
Overall, Morbius is a pretty terrible film that lives up to the expectations that I have been told. No good things come from this film and should be avoided at all cost.Rating - 2/10.",Notr

I'm not sure why the mid-credit scene was even needed, as it made the already incohesive story more incoherent.

1091,"Morbius: A Vampire with a scientific origin story. It fits into the MCU, there are a few clues buried in the film so pay attention, no need to wait for mid-credits teasers. A tale of mortality, Morbius and his ""brother"" Milo have a chronic blood illness, they meet as 10 year olds in a clinic run by Nicholas. Morbius vows to ensure that they grow into cranky old men together. Morbius is cranky anyway, 25 years later he turns down a Nobel Prize at the Stockholm ceremony because his invention of artificial blood was only a by product of his ongoing search for a cure for the blood disease. Milo's wealth funds the research laboratory run by Morbius but they both realise time is short as does Martine his co-researcher. An experiment splicing vampire bat genes with his own goes awry transforming Morbius into a Vampire and putting Martine at risk.Some great combat scenes, especially aboard the freighter where the clandestine experiment is being carried out, Morbius picks off his victims among the gangways and pipes. The tearing out of throats etc is a bit restrained and often off camera to ensure a lower age rating for the film. The opening sequence involving Morbius encountering a cave full of vampire bats is spectacular. While generally impressive the CGI is a bit ropy but not in the usual sense: Vampires move swiftly leaving coloured ropes or tendrils in their wake. The vampire nemesis of Morbius is truly savage, like the Joker at times with his grimaces. Jared Leto is best when he plays Morbius in his debilitated state or as a Vampire, less so when Morbius is an enhanced human. Jared Harris is Nicholas with Matt Smith as Milo and Adria Arjona playing Martine; all put in convincing performances. I get the impression that some crucial scenes may have ended up on the editing room floor during so I await a director's cut. Directed by Daniel Espinosa from a screenplay by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. 7/10.",Notr

So many iconic lines and action sequences, I couldn't help but cry tears of joy. Jared Leto as Morbius (not venom) is goated. What can this man not do? When Morbius said ""where there's a will, there's a morb"" i felt that in my soul. Full standing ovation from my fellow morbheads for the rest of the third act. This is Sci-fi at it's peakest. I expect a full sweep at the Oscars.",Notr
1096,"As I write this review, Morbius has a 5.2 rating on IMDb. I definitely think that's way too low! If you're a big fan of the MCU, then be sure to watch this movie. Yeah facts are really good. But the plot twist is pretty generic: what does a good guy do when he gets powers that make him a bad guy? There's not a lot of originality as the answer that question but the movie isn't. ""bad""! Just understand that it is almost 100% origin story so don't expect a big complex plot or narrative. I like the two leads, especially the ""bad guy"" - but who IS the ""bad"" guy!? : )
Not sure if the movie did well enough that we'll see a sequel, but this character deserves to be given another story, so that we see him become Morbius!",Notr
1097,"If you read articles about 'Morbius the Living Vampire', you'll doubtless be reminded how it was one of the biggest flops of 2022. It only made a few squillion dollars profit instead of *loads* of squillions of dollars profit. In the high-flying world of big-budget mainstream films, of franchise 'universes', a mediocre performance is unforgivable.The film itself I found to be okay. The pacing dragged somewhat in the middle, which made me question why it was given 104 minutes of runtime instead of something leaner. The acting from Jared Leto as the title character Michael Morbius is good, supported by a surprisingly flat turn from Matt Smith as his pal Milo - although it's curiously wonderful to hear the former Doctor Who say 'ar*ehole.' We also get your typical husky, strutting, growling cop, and there are a few other sundry characters we never really get to know.Michael conducts a series of blood experiments to cure his malady and that of his friend. It's no spoiler that he becomes vampirised, but isn't fazed by daylight or crucifixes and looks smashing with his shirt off.Overall, the film is average, but with some very good set-pieces. It looks spectacular, of course, in the way that all mainstream films do. Possibly the reason it is perceived as a failure is that it tries to appeal to fans of superheroes as well as horror hounds and ends up satisfying neither. Minus points for the CGI-fest in the final scenes; there are also a couple of tie-ins mid/post credits to the bigger Marvel Universe which will be meaningless unless you're familiar with other brands and franchises in the factory such films have become. My score is 5 out of 10.",Notr
1098,"You'd think from some of the reviews I've seen this was the worst thing ever made. Was it an amazing film and a good addition to marvel? No. But, it's not horrendous either. It has some glaringly obvious issues when you watch and the plot felt a bit soulless. But it could have been much much worse!What's the issues? For me the main annoyance I had was the writing of the film. It just seemed so disjointed at times and almost rushed. It felt like someone went ""write a marvel film you have a week"" and this is the product. The final half an hour or so really illustrated this as it felt like it would almost skip parts (won't give examples due to spoilers) and certain actions weren't explained. I feel like they needed to flesh out the plot a bit more and with it being a short film, they could have done this easily.The characters. So actually the base set of characters on face value is absolutely fine. But the chemistry between them just wasn't there. Distinct lack of character depth as well didn't help either. The romance side of the plot made absolutely zero sense and came from nowhere as there was absolutely no sexual chemistry or anything even hinting to it. The actual villain played by fellow Rovers fan Matt Smith needed more depth. He kind of just becomes a villain for no reason. Give us more! Just became hard to root for anyone really.Little niggles I want to mention. I wanted the fight scenes to be a little better. Was quite hard to see what was actually happening because it was that fast and there wasn't enough of it either. The film is basically 95% shot in the dark, which from an audience point of view it got annoying.So yeah, for me that's Morbius' biggest issues and I think what's annoyed me more is that this could have been amazing, but just fell so flat. Like it's not the worst film you'll see by any stretch, but I left feeling dissatisfied. It's average at the end of the day and that's why I'm going 5/10.",Notr

1111,"Yeah it's just as bad, maybe even worse than everyone's saying. It's a film farted out by Sony as a shameless attempt at starting their own marvel universe by picking an unknown character and quickly dumping out a crappy film to capitalize on the Batman hype. I am being 100% truthful and honest with you this movie had barely any effort put into it at all, it just feels like a complete cashgrab, this is the superhero movie equivalent of a straight to VOD late career Bruce Willis movie.Okay, let's start with the positives.... uhhhh.... I guess the production design was okay? It wasn't really shot all too poorly, I think? I mean there are indeed some really flat shots and ugly sequences but it's not all bad, and that's where the list of positives end.Now let me be clear: I hate writing super negative reviews because it feels like I'm bullying the people who worked on this, movies are hard to make and all, but I have next to no sympathy for studio cashgrab movies they had the budget to make it good and took the easy way out, I do feel bad for Jared Leto and Matt Smith, I love Matt, and I want him to be in better stuff, but he's awful in this. I have a really hard time blaming Leto and Smith for their bad performances because it honestly doesn't entirely feel like their fault, rather it feels as though the writers are to blame. The script is dinosaur dung incarnate, I have no idea how someone proof read this and said ""yeah that's good,"" Morbius and Milo have 0 character whatsoever, no defining character traits, no development, no depth, not even a motive, no that's not a joke they have no motive whatsoever. Milo was crippled as a kid and he was bullied as a kid now he wants vampire powers so he can walk and kill people who aren't crippled? I say this as a question because that's what I thought his motive was until it just changed at the middle, he just becomes a bad guy who wants to kill Morbius for some unspoken reason; I assume it's because Morbius didn't give him the serum when he asked for it, but not only is this poorly conveyed to the viewer, but it's such petty drama and makes his character look like a giant child.Morbius is just a doctor guy I honestly don't know what his goal even is or who he's supposed to be, he has a love interest but the romance is soooo forced, him and his lady friend share 3 scenes together, kiss, and that's it. They have 0 reason to be together at all, and the woman who plays his lady friend was a bad actress as well. There's two detective characters who they keep cutting back to but they're completely pointless, in fact, they just forget about them by the end of the movie. The ""jokes"" in this movie were hilarious, so hilarious in fact, that whenever they said a joke, NOBODY in my theater laughed. I think I heard a guy cough once. And talk about cliche, holy crap this movie follows that marvel formula to a tee, even ending with that same goddamn giant cgi epilepsy fight, but this time it's so unbelievably lame and uninspired, and there's no reason for it to happen at all. The cgi was terrible, it might've been worse than Venom, it feels so tryhardy, like this movie really wants you to think it looks cooler than it actually does. Some really goofy stuff happens in this movie as well but it's so far and few between that it makes it so you can't even watch it in the same way as Venom. Characters will die and it makes no impact at all because they aren't fleshed out in the slightest, and don't get me started on Morbius's powers, he can like glide on wind or something, he can't do it when he needs to fly off a building but he can fly... in front of a train? What? And even though he says he has ""bat sonar"" it's just super hearing, like do the writers even know what sonar is? The ending in this movie was horrible sequel bait nonsense, it was completely unsatisfying and just stupid this whole movie is so stupid and it doesn't even know it.Do not waste your time or money viewing this piece of trash, it is boring nonsense from start to finish, it not a so bad it's good movie like venom, more of a so pathetic it's dull type of movie.",Notr

The list is now called Morbius and some other films you might like here and there. Certified Fresh on RT is now changed to 'Roughly 1/4 as good as Morbius'.Agatha Christie was asked what it was like to be named a Dame of the British Empire and she said, ""pretty nice, but I won't live long enough to see Morbius, so everything else pales beside that.""James Hetfield was asked how he felt to walk out on stage in front of 1.3M fans. He said, ""man, we were Morbin'!""I can say I have seen this movie over 150,000 times. That's in my imagination, but it's the same thing.

1113,"Morbius is about Dr. Michael Morbius who looks for a cure for a rare blood disease that he and his best friend are suffering from only that the cure he makes turns him into a vampire. Morbius did not have a great story. It is engaging but unfortunately it really falls flat. The movie does have some great special effects and CGI use. But the thing that was upsetting was that there were so much stuff in the trailer that got people really hyped then the movie came out and it had none of that stuff which wrecked the movie. The main villain is not at all scary, menacing, intimidating or terrifying he was pretty lame but funny! The side characters also had nothing to do in the movie it's like the Director didn't know what to do with them so they are kinda just there.Jared Leto takes on the role of Morbius and I am not a fan of him at all but he does to a good job playing Morbius playing the sick man who has hope for a cure then playing a man that is scared of what he became well also playing a monster. Matt Smith plays Morbius's best friend and main villain he does make him charming and funny but not much else. Tyrese Gibson plays a cop who has nothing to do in the movie he is just there.

The references to MCU movies are forced and cringy. Also, misrepresented. The post credit scene is idiotic.It has zero re-watch value.

It's been years since I read a comic book so honestly I didn't even know who this character was. And almost certainly I wasn't going to let other reviews influence mine. But sometimes, if rarely, I am with the geneal concecus on this picture.I'll start with ultimately why this movie was doomed to fail. And it falls solely in the lap on the screenwriter and director. The story is a convoluted shambles, every scene and line of dialogue that could of potentially set up the development of these characters has been grossly overlooked, it's so rushed. For instance, when our main character is coming to terms with his new found 'powers' after spending his whole life in excruciating pain, he learns what his body can do (heightened strength, speed, climb walls etc) and accepts this within 60 seconds.You put that in comparison to say Spider-Man/Batman who arguably take whole movies to come to grips with their abilities. The whole movie instead spends it's time and effort on its action sequences, which I'm sorry look dated by decades, it looks awful.While not being remotely as entertaining as 'Venom' which in itself is not terrific they both share one similar problem, and that's opting out of the R rating. What makes these characters on paper at least interesting is the level of violence they can afflict, and since that can't be translated on screen, the battle is already lost.I didn't particularly want to mention the performances because believe it or not, that's the least of the movies problems. But while Leto is more than committed to stay in character, lose or gain weight, and pretty much do anything he can to look the part, he just doesn't have the ability or range to deliver a mesmerizing performance. I don't by any means think it's his worst performance, in fact, by his standards it's alright, but he's not a leading man. And trying to force something to work doesn't mean it will.Obviously there will be no sequel, shame that the passion that goes into Marvels principle movies doesn't get put into these. But for all intents and purpose, this spin off world they have created, is dead.",Notr

1119,"This could have easily been a three hour movie and I wish it had been. While there are glimpses into Michael's past, they are not highly developed. In fact, I'd venture to say that Michael is post antidotal for 80% or more of the movie. While this direction allows for more action, it's less emotional and less exciting due to the lack of character development. There is no journey between any of main character's childhoods and career. It's more of a flashback per se. I would have liked to have seen more of the struggle in condition and in experimentation. How Michael arrived at his treatment is explained in seconds and is the only trial viewed. Something along the lines of I am Legend would have been nice. All of that aside, the visuals were phenomenal. The stage, costume, and locations were all satisfying. While some have criticized the special effects, the CGI is well executed; though, it isn't ground breaking as it's very similar to the style seen by Nightcrawler in the X-Men franchise or perhaps, Jumper. While the movie is action packed with a few intense moments, it does suffer from a bit of predictability. Overall, it's a decent film thats quite enjoyable for a Friday night flick. I would also say it flirts with an R rating, so don't let the PG13 rating scare you away too far.",Notr
1120,"I'm tired of comic book movies, and only watched this as my local was showing it for next to nothing (so basically they were practically giving tickets away to get people to watch this, not something that I've ever known before to happen to recent releases). They made up for the difference with me buying a big popcorn!From the off, I'll concede that I'd heard how poor this was from the reviews and so went into it with low expectations, maybe it was the popcorn that was all I wanted. Anyhow, I've watched it and in truth I don't think it's as bad as critics are making it out to be but also not that great either. It's - meh!This is a vampire-esque movie where our antagonist is cursed with vampire superpowers and out to stop his old friend who goes too far wit the serum that caused their new condition. The problem for many is that Jared Leto has unfairly and wrongly become a whipping boy. I think he's a great actor, but is now lumbered with some of lesser rated roles (such as in Gucci and Suicide Squad) being held against him. Give him a break, he's actually good in this film, he's NOT the problem.For me the problem is that this is really should be a darker horror film but tones down and is a mish-mash to be more of a comic book film, and that tone takes away from what it could have been. Also Matt Smith as the antagonist hams it up, and despite him being British, I have no clue what his accent was all about! Really terrible!This film is a fine popcorn movie, but the negatives can't be dismissed. It will be fine for most as a one-off viewing but definitely not for little kids even though it is a Marvel movie! Give it a go for a one-off, just keep your mind open.",Notr

In reality, he's quite a talented and diverse actor but the script for the movies is what let's him down. Side note, Joker should never have been in Suicide Squad, he is not part of it. Morbius is nice easy to watch short Marvel film. Nothing spectacular, but also nothing as boring and pretentious as Eternals. The movie has an easy to follow story, some light bits of comedy, a love interest, and some fight scenes like any other Marvel movie. You don't need to invest too much into this to enjoy it.

1125,"""It's not as bad as you heard"", is certainly the very definition of damning something with faint praise, but that is exactly the right thing to say about the 2022 Sony Comic Book Film Adaptation of MORBIUS.Starring Jared Leto, MORBIUS follows the origin story - and first adventure - of Spiderman villain Morbius who, inexplicably, becomes the hero in this story.While, ultimately, not a good film, there are some good things happening here, so let's begin there.The lead performance by Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius is - very surprisingly - somewhat grounded in reality. Leto is not one to be subtle in his character choices (see HOUSE OF GUCCI) but in this one, he is (somewhat) reserved. It would have been easy for Leto to go over the top with this character, but he wisely chooses the opposite route...and it works. The always watchable Jared Harris (CHERNOBYL) is on-board in the ""mentor"" role while Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal bring some humor to the proceedings as ""Agents"" who are chasing after Morbius. The rest of the cast are benign - neither adding nor detracting from the proceedings - with the exception of Matt Smith (LAST NIGHT IN SOHO) who's character is so badly written that he flounders under the weight of the absurdity of what his character is tasked with.Trying to overcome the ridiculousness of the story is the Direction by Daniel Espinosa (the Denzel Washington action flick SAFE HOUSE). He moves the action along quickly, never really lingering on the absurdities of the events going on (and there are PLENTY of absurdities to avoid - more on that later) and Espinosa actually has an artistic vision of what he wanted to accomplish visually in this comic-book film, freezing many frames when the picture on the screen looked like a page from a graphic novel. It's a smart choice for a film that can only be described as dumb.And dumb this film is. I kept feeling any sense of common sense and reality slip away as this film - written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless - quickly devolved into the absurd and ridiculous. One does have to suspend belief when watching Comic Book films (how else are we going to believe that a man can turn into a human spider) but in this case, the suspension is mighty - it is one of the dumbest films ever made (in terms of plot and situations) and that is saying something. The makers of this film really stretch the term ""go with me here"" as Morbius is constantly chasing and evolving and being chased in the most absurd ways throughout this film with special effects that add to the absurdity of the proceedings. To be fair, this film never falls into the ""so bad it's good"" range, it hovers just above that line.The end credits scenes start to setup a ""Sinister Six"" Spiderman film, so there is some hope for this - it would be interesting to see Leto's Morbius team up with some other Spiderman villains (who's names would be a spoiler), provided the script is better. There's no way that it can be worse.MORBIUS is not a bad film - it just will insult your intelligence.Letter Grade: C4 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Notr
1126,First of all the special effects are good! I do not understand the negative reviews of this movie and conversely it probably helped me to enjoy it more.

The story is basic, the plot and the characters could be further developed, but the director preferred to keep everything simple. There are some gaps in the story of the movie. As it progresses they explain it to you but you feel that some details are missing to give it a little more flavor in the climax moments of the movie.Jared leto was an incredible performance. You can't ask for less from an excellent actor. Despite the bad reviews they have of the famous places, Morbius is a project that well worked can open schemes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Blade vs. Morbius showdown would be unique in the CINEMA.",Notr

I don't know everything about multiverses, but I like superhero movies because of the classic dilemma of how to stay 'human' meanwhile being different, and how to keep a stand towards things like temptation.

If the screenplay was more focused on troubled dr. Morbius, and let the actor(s) do what they do best, act, that would certainly deliver the whole different movie. With some movies, its better not try to please all the audience, some may be left to adults, and not to cut all the blood and gore so the children can watch it. That way you get sterile CGI movie, but it still wont appeal to kids since they, luckily, still don't know the struggles about major life transformations and decisions which main character needs to endure.

To be honest, the movie wasn't really that bad but it just didn't make sense and left more to be desired for in terms of complexity.This feels almost like an unfinished movie or like a script that was based on several different iterations of editing, there were so many details that left me confused and not understanding how/why things were taking place. The plot is more like something that you would see in a VERY early super hero movie where things don't need to make sense, they just need to be surmounting the viewers expectations. I found myself laughing at how absurd parts of the plot were when I was explaining the movie to those who had not seen it.Save yourself the time and don't watch this movie.",Notr

I also saw The Batman recently.. and I actually found Morbius much more enjoyable to watch. Batman was pretty cheesy to me.So I was pretty shocked afterward to see how poorly rated the movie is. Yes the movie ended too soon.. it felt like it didn't have much of an ending. However I just took that to mean that it's a simple origin story setting up future movies. Admittedly that is a lazy approach but it's better than feeling like the movies being stretched too long with useless filler.. which I find the case with many films.So if you want to see a really fun movie with exceptional sound and visuals, Morbius fits the bill for me. Just don't expect a masterpiece or a profound story.. it's clearly intended to be the first of many of the character (although given the abysmal ratings maybe that won't happen as they intended)",Notr

The characters are really a hit or a miss, some of them make unbelievably bad decisions. The pace is good in the first two acts, however in the final act the movie is shaken by re-recordings which becomes evident as there are scenes out of place. Not to mention the dialogue...
The action is weak: strange effects, sloppy editing, terrible choreography and unnecessary slow motions, joined by an unoriginal soundtrack.Generally performances were good Jared Leto is far from being the movie's problem and Matt Smith is wronged by lack of character development (villain).Althoug enterteining this film suffers from poor writing, sloppy editing, post production issues and the need to rush everything to promote future projects (same old mistakes). Sony continues to produce failure after failure...",Notr

They should have gone with a ""R"" rating. This would have given it the edge this movie needed, without going too far into horror. Instead, they go with Ole faithful ""PG-13"" and it sucks some of the life out of this one. It doesn't take too long for Morbius to become Morbius and the special effects are GREAT. With that being said, there is something missing. A great antagonist. It felt forced, like they HAD to go the way they did. And that makes for a more predictable flick.

The visual effects were a poor spin on The Matrix with disorientating focus reminiscent of the worst Michael Bay styling.The story was wasn't very interesting. The vampires didn't even look as good as Buffy The Vampire Slayer.The first maybe ten minutes made a familiar but not unwelcome attempt to ground the transformation with sci-fi detailing but it farcically descended in to fantasy in a way that way really jarring. If it had the humor and fun of a usual Marvel outing maybe this would have been fine but with it's self serious tone it just came off as lazy.I really don't even think die hard Marvel and comic book fans would be in to this.It did make want to watch Blade though to take the taste away.",Notr

It told the story of Dr. Michael Morbius and how he ended up like he is, I thought it was good at doing that. I can say this is not Leto's best, I feel he could have done better to add to the character, in fact all the acting was a little bland, like nobody was into it. So maybe it could have been better with a different director, sometimes you can feel when a director just doesn't get the best out of the actors, I felt that. With that said, it was still an enjoyable movie for me, and I think non comic book fans with zero expectation will enjoy this even more. Some people were expecting way too much out of this movie and probably wouldn't be happy unless Spider-Man showed up. I mean we are talking Morbius, and I thought this was better than the last Venom which just blew the Carnage appearance. This movie had little to work with and did better.This was a fine set up movie for Morbius, obviously there is more to come, maybe a movie in alternate universe with an Andrew Garfield Spider-Man and Tom Hardy Venom.

Yes, you cannot compare it to movies like Black Panther, Avengers or even any Spider-Man MCU movie but it is an entertaining movie. I would say it's better than a lot of those mediocre superhero movies. Yeah the post-credits don't make sense but that's not the movie right. I like the acting by both Matt Smith and Jared Leto, their chemistry is great. Jared Leto gave his all. The acts are not that well differentiated but the fight sequences are great especially the slowed ones, it just feels like an immersive experience. I like the way the powers of vampires are portrayed. The movie feels like a typical superhero movie with a backstory and a proper conclusion. I don't know what the fuss is all about. Though yeah if you expect an avengers level movie you will be disappointed a lot but you know not to expect that it's a low-budget superhero movie. I hope my opinion makes you alteast try you watch that on an ott and not on the cinema. But well let's see what Sony can do.",Notr

It's a cookie cutter plot for an origin story. That's not bad. It's just that the Marvel audience has had two decades experience with origin stories... it might've been better not to be so lazy and to serve up a more unique way to tell the story. I'm not sure that I can point to things that are bad.

However for a standalone movie it wasn't bad, but because people dont know Morbius I think it would of helped if they had cameos of others like blade etc. Or they should of had him introduced into someone else's movie first like how Black Panther was introduced in the avengers movies.

1166,"Not sure why this movie got such low reviews. I read a lot of them and simply disagree with many of the hyper-criticisms. The movie is reasonably well paced, acted, and plotted. I think that when rating movies these days, there is a strange split between rating canon and rating the value/experience of the movie on its own merits. I tend toward the latter. As I have aged, I have found that unless I'm solely specifically looking for canon in my movies, I find that enjoying the movie mostly untethered to other expectations tends to lead to the best experience - this is such a movie.The focus is more on character experiences rather than straight up over-the-top continual fireball/lightning bolt duels that you get with most comic/superhero movies. The special effects were interesting even if totally CGI. For instance, one thing that I liked is the random bullet-time slow speed moments in some of Morbius' fights where the scene looks like something straight out of a comic book action freeze frame. I like the overall ambiance of it and other such creative flare moments that pop up. As for the plot, yah, you can probably tell where the movie's going before it gets there but somehow it still works out to an interesting explorative trip.Having said that, if you're a HARDCORE comic goer or follower of the specific comic Morbius looking for a movie with ULTRA gore; are completely focused on constant arguments about what is canon and whatnot with the character; are focused on the absolute cutting edge newest of the new special effects (ones that are less than like five minutes old); want 10 plot lines with 10 different random superheroes characters thrown in throughout; ...then this movie might not be for you. However, if you are just a regular movie-goer (or relaxed comic fan) that wants to see a good movie for the evening without unnecessary over the top undue complications and an interesting theme with a logical regular conscious flowing plot line of one main character, ...then definitely give this movie a shot. It's a good night out regardless of any light flaws it might have.",Notr
1167,"It is very, very hard to understand. The producers spend millions upon millions of dollars. They are businesspersons. They are not visionaries. They are not artists. They are investors who hedge bets based on the advice from people with extensive experience and doctorates-entire thinktanks that are paid millions of dollars to make sure that the investors are taking the smallest, most negligible risk possible. How then and why do massive failures happen? Let us think of Kevin Costner. Just because he pulled Dances with Wolves out of his puckering arsehole, everyone was absolutely convinced that Water World, Wyatt Earp, and The Postman would be the next greatest, best, and biggest money-making movie ever. I cannot help to wonder, after these three, if they had made one more. Fields of Dream Corn, for example. I never thought it would happen again. But then they did it. They created Morphius, a film that hit all the right categories but did not realize that whole is always more than the sum of the parts. There is no problem with the acting. There is no problem with the cinematography. There is no problem with the special effects. There is no problem with the basic storyline. The directing is above average and more than enough gets the job done. The producers smiled at themselves and congratulated the thinktank for doing such a superb and supremely awesome job, and I am sure they salivated as they confidently waited for their project to pay off. But the movie was horrible, and it was the one of the greatest failures in cinematic history. Why? It was because the machine, and the cogs that make up the machine, had not heart, for this is who they are, and like Morphius's nemesis in the movie, who they have become.",Notr

As always it was comic lovers of him saying it was bad because it wasn't like the comics. Which shouldn't matter in a movie.So I finally seen the movie and I have to say, it was not as bad as I thought it would be. Leto did a great job in his role. However the movie didn't really give me any emotions while watching. Even after the end I was like ""Hmm"" and that was it.It felt out of for a Marvel movie. The story wasn't all that appealing. As with the same reason I didn't care about the comic, vampire stuff is just always the same. The pacing also felt really off too. The only things that I even cared about were the credit scenes. If Morbius never appeared again I probably wouldn't even remember he existed in a movie.While vampires are kind of repetitive, I still am looking forward to Blade. Who is WAY more interesting then Morbious seems to be. I am curious how the two may fit together in the MCU given they both have the same vampire theme going.Again, Leto's acting was great.

1173,"Morbius, the third entry in Sony's own Spider-man Universe, is a comic book movie out of the 90s Sam Raimi Spider-man era, like Daredevil or Ghost Rider.Sony's unsophisticated approach leaves Morbius out of sync with modern blockbuster expectations. It adapts the bare minimum from its source material and instead the script draws a lot from horror films we've seen before.Jared Leto, in his first leading man role in a blockbuster, shelves his headline-making method acting and plays it straight to a script that gives him nothing interesting to do, rendering a bland and humorless experience.To say a few good things, the Morbius CGI make-up is well done as it allows the vampire look to change in various states of thirst. It visually shows Morbius' struggle controlling his thirst.Michael Morbius and Milo's story begins in a promising manner. The character dynamic is borrowed from Park Chan-wook's Thirst, where a reluctant vampire creates a bloodthirsty vampire. However, Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless' script never follows this friendship in earnest. The middle portion remixes ideas and scenes from other movies in a box-ticking manner, such as David Cronenberg's The Fly and Blade.The script sinfully ends abruptly after its climax and is missing a satisfying resolution. Yes, Morbius defeated the villain but how does he truly come to terms with becoming a vampire? The movie provides no answer.Finally, in the film's most cynical move, it immediately teases what's next with its two after-credit scenes. The first scene was expected but poorly written. The second scene made no sense at all and was like a studio exec puppeting the actors to say whatever he wants like Rick Moranis playing with action figures in Spaceballs.If Sony chose to bring Tom Holland's Spider-man back into this Sony universe, I'd be scratching my head on how he would fit in with this roster of villains in tone. By giving each villain a solo outing, they've all become anti-heroes.Sony's Venom movies, which are oddball buddy comedies, fared much better and can be enjoyed in a guilty pleasure trashy way purely from the silliness of watching Tom Hardy argue with himself. Ultimately, what sinks Morbius into being a dud is it's a lot of ""been there, done that"" and doesn't put anything interesting on the table.",Notr

I sometimes just sit and think about it for hours and actually feel myself in deep, really deep in myself. This film got me out of a depression and it has been really supportive ever since.

1177,"In October of 1971, the anti-hero then villain Morbius was debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #101. This is when the world was introduced to Dr. Michael Morbius who over the years has developed quite the following, even when teaming up with Spidey, Blade, Dr. Strange and many others but eventually returning to his darker roots. This introduced the world to one of the most brutal killers that ever graced the MARVEL pages, from 1974-75 he would get his own book and over a period of 16 years would be a guest in various books up until 1993. The summer of '93 ""Rise of the Midnight Sons"" crossover story arc which ran for 32 issues reintroduced the world to his vampiric charm.Now we fast forward to 2022, where superheroes are a dime a dozen but still have the going power to fill seats. As Vampire films are a popular sub category in the horror genre, it seems that Morbius will fit right in as a multifaceted superhero feature, sadly only as a PG-13 entry and running at 104 minutes. After my first initial viewing, I was excited to see one of my favourite characters come to life on the big screen but, after a second watch I did notice not one or two but several discrepancies that bordered on ""camp"". I also had some issues with his origins and even a slight bit confusing post scene which I will address without taking anything way from the film itself.Dr. Michael Morbius, is played by noneother than the multi-talented indie film favourite Jared Leto who is in his first ever big budget starring role. Leto who is also a vampire enthusiast, also plays the dual role of a producer in the film as well. Another star of the film is noneother than ""The Doctor"" himself, Matt Smith (Doctor Who & The Crown) who plays Morbius' best friend ""Milo"". Jared Harris known for his roles in such TV and Film hits as (Sherlock Holmes and The Crown) plays Dr. Emil Nicholas who helped raise and care for both ""Milo"" and Morbius during their early years. Adria Arjona plays his fiancée and lab assistant, Martine Bancroft. The film starts out with a much older Morbius in South America seeking the cure for his illness, which involves a plethora of vampire bats and a blade across the palm. Its a quick intro, which I personally thought should have been placed elsewhere in the film. We are then introduced to a young Michael Morbius, sick and bedridden. This is also where his life takes a turn when he meets his new bed fellow ""Milo"", who becomes his best friend. During this time, we begin to see the brilliance that young Morbius has even though his illness is a major influence he pushes on through the bullying and the isolation. His friendship with ""Milo"" blossoms until he is taken to a school for the gifted, the two stay in touch as Michael continues learning and slowly becomes a highly respected and Nobel Prize-winning biologist specializing in the field of human and animal biology with a medical degree in hematology. By this time, he has been introduced to the beautiful and equally brilliant , Martine Bancroft who works alongside him trying to find the cure that is slowly killing both Michael and ""Milo"". As the story drives on, a cure seems to be close at hand ergo we sync back up to the opening sequence and are now all caught up with the origin of how and why.Now, once the action kicked in...the Vampire in me smiled and began to get invested. The CGI was done well, although I am a fan of practical effects I feel that they nailed the look and the mannerisms of Morbius as ""The Living Vampire"". The Venom-isque fighting scenes were cool to see but I think they relied too much on the CGI for the vampire sequences and should have focused more on Leto's performance and allowed the audience to see where he wanted to take us the viewers. Something else that as a horror fan that I personally got a kick out of was the ""easter eggs"" from different classic vampire films that were placed throughout the film. I think the villain even though he was created especially for the film, was a bit too campy. He did have his moments and had a cool vampire look.I personally feel the backstory was rushed, especially the childhood and the exclusion of certain characters and the addition of others was in no way needed and honestly it felt like the writers really didn't get or like the original source material. This is a dark story, it always has been and trying to make it a PG-13 when SONY and MARVEL's Deadpool had a Rated R, so why would a horror not be? The film took two years to film and they had members of Ridley Scott's team and the team who worked on the CGI for the Avengers films and it shows that there was heart put into it. And I honestly loved this film but it just rushed altogether and ends a bit short.As I said before the end post scene that included Michael Keaton is overtly confusing (as Leto himself publicly hinted at the Sinister Six) as the original members were subdued and ""converted"" in ""Spiderman - No Way Home"". As all comic book fans know Morbius himself had NOTHING to do with the Six, so I suppose we will have to see exactly what SONY has in mind. They also poke fun at Venom at one point in the film, which was fun but weird. Its so fast, if you don't listen for it you could miss it. I personally would love to see a ""Midnight Suns"" Trilogy if they could team up again with MARVEL and grab some loaner characters that would make for a awesome story arc.All in all, I enjoyed sinking my teeth into this incarnation of one of MARVEL's Anti-heroes. I have already pre-ordered my copy and you should too. Its great fun and a worthy addition to the Spidey-Verse collection as well as your horror movie Vampire collection, I mean let's face it Jared Leto makes for one badass and sexy vampire.",Notr

I think the main criticism I can give this movie is that it's just boring, the movie isn't long but it just seems to drag, the action is there but it's not great and the story just seems to drag and is a utter mess. Even with Matt Smith someone who I like even he couldn't shine in this movie. Unfortunately it's not a great movie and it's disappointing what sony is doing with the Spider-Man universe, although I liked the Venom movies this just isn't good. I was intrigued that they brought Adrian Toomes in the credit scene we'll see what that brings.",Notr
1181,"This movie is not trying to be what it's not. It's a fun comic book flick about an ambiguous hero, and it knows it.The visuals are great, the story is not perfect, but engaging enough. I loved the costume choices for the characters, the overall mood - eerie at times, thrilling, curious. Great showcase of Morbius's powers! Remarkable acting from Matt Smith, as well as from other actors. The touch of horror was just perfect - it wasn't too scary, but it was enough to make you twitch.I loved it. It was fun!",Notr
1182,"Critics didn't like it. I did. 'Morbius' tells the story of brilliant scientist Michael Morbius, who suffers from a rare blood disease.Morbius (Jared Leto) befriended Lucien/Milo (Matt Smith) from a very young age when they both were in the same hospital with the same blood disease. From this young age, Morbius was a promising young man, who ensured Milo he would one day find a cure. The character set-up was good enough for me to root for them and understand why they did what they did later in life.Desperate to found a cure and become 'normal', Morbius' methods are unorthodox, to say the least, as he pushes the boundaries of what is considered acceptable for the sake of science. Morbius succeeded in finding a cure, with blood taken from vampire bats. However, it turned out to be a curse, as the cure would be short-lived with the effects wearing off after just a few hours. And it turned him into a vicious blood-craving vampire.'Morbius' is an entirely new take on the vampire genre. Maybe we should call him the new generation Batman - ha-ha-ha!! Many scenes reminded me of 'Batman', and I had to convince myself this was actually a vampire movie and not a 'Batman' entry.The storytelling made the film feel more realistic than most vampire movies. Opposed to killing, Morbius doesn't want to drink human blood, but just how long can he resist? Find out for yourself! With action, adventure, drama, suspense, fantasy, horror and even time for romance, 'Morbius' was an exciting - yet very different - superhero movie. I also enjoyed the lack of humour, considering this is a Marvel movie and they so love adding humour!The antagonist turns out to be Morbius' own best friend. This character ended up so similar to other Marvel villains that there was nothing really remarkable about him. Nevertheless, he was still an evil villain.The visual effects and make-up were fantastic. My only criticism were the finale. The climax is your typical Hollywood superhero, over-the-top, CGI laden, create-as-much-havoc-as-possible cliche. I felt this could have been toned down and would have been more effective in the process. Regardless, I still enjoyed 'Morbius' very much.",Notr
1183,"I suppose this movie could have been descent, it at least could have been something, because I do recognize that unlike the Venom movies, the tone isn't all over the place and the gore feels appropriate and this movie does have actual themes (albeit dull ones). This movie could have gotten a 4/10 from me but it was just ruined by the antagonist.Milo the Vampire is an entirely made up character just for the purposes of this movie. He is at least partially based on Hunger from the comics. I don't know a lot about this character but I'm assuming that he was written at least decently and Milo in this film is written terribly. He goes from being a totally normal and otherwise nice guy to being a bloodthirsty psychopath who wants to have complete dominion over the world. You might say that his dosage of Michael's vampire serum could have caused this but this just isn't the case. In this movie we see that as long as vampires are given blood they stay the same as they would be normally. Milo's justification for killing people is nonexistent, he literally has access to artificial blood and deliberately chooses not to drink it, preferring to murder and eat innocent people instead. He even kills people without drinking their blood. Again, this all would have made sense if he was already a bad guy before he gets the serum, but he wasn't. He is very clearly just a normal dude. Superhero movies need to stop ignoring the villain's motivation, it is an extremely crucial part of the film.",Notr
1184,I truly am sad that this film was done the way it was. Everything was less than average for 2022. The story telling and CGI were the worst part of the film. Someone who worked on The amazing spiderman 2 must've worked on Morbius because it has very similar flaws which reminded me of The amazing spiderman 2 the whole time I was watching. Really sad.,Notr
1185,"Compared to some of the reviews, I actually really liked Jared Leto as Morbius. He is an odd character which he plays well, but it also feels like he doesn't get any room to truly act. I also think Morbius himself is actually a really cool character that could have a great story to tell. This is just not it..This movies suffers from either terrible writing or terrible editing. Probably both. The story starts of rather good but as soon as Morbius is introduced it all just becomes a mess. The Milo story makes absolutely no sense and tyrese Gibson as an FBI agent? That was probably one of the worst ideas ever. And the FBI that just kinda accepts Morbius having a lust for blood? Like it is just a normal day. The action scenes feel rushed, In these scenes you can see how cool Morbius could have been. Actually, everything feels rushed. Maybe this movie and this character just really suffer from not having an R- rating. Maybe then they could have done more with the story.I hope Leto will get a second chance in a second movie with a WAY better story.In my opinion they should only have focused on Morbius himself. Maybe like this:Morbius finds a cure. At first he feels great, even becomes a bit cocky. Starts to enjoy life and starts drinking and finally goes out. Doing things he never could. But then strange things start to happen. Just little things. He wakes up without knowing how he got to his bed ( maybe the alcohol) then the next morning he wakes up with his jacket missing, then he wakes up with blood on his clothes.Meanwhile you hear about a killing spree on the news. Morbius finds it horrible but doesn't think anything of it. Then his behavior starts to slowly change. He is becoming more agitated and aggressive, ( his alter ego starts to scratch the surface) but people around him just see it as cocky and arrogant. Then one day a little girl is brought into the hospital. She is a survivor of the killer. Her parents are both dead and she won't make it either. Morbius has to threat her and is horrified by what he sees and hears. She looks familiar, but he just dismisses it.Right before she dies she recognizes something about Morbius that her attacker also had. Maybe a ring or a necklace or something. She starts to scream and then dies in horror. Morbius is horrified by what happened and suddenly starts to get flashbacks.Then he starts to research her attack and he finds out her parents also look familiar. He starts digging deeper and learns that al the victims look familiar and he starts getting more and more horrific flashbacks.Eventually he finds out what really happened and is overcome with guild. That's when he needs to learn more about his alter ego and how to control its needs. And eventually fuse with his alter ego for something heroic.No villain is introduced yet. Morbius is the villain of his own movie.",Notr
1186,"I honestly thought it was a really good film. It did often feel a bit lacking in real character development or storyline. There were a few characters i really expected them to do more with and when they didnt it was frustrating. Obviously because of all of this, i do understand its negative reviews but with that said i was still completely captivated. The acting was great. The effects were interesting. Would definitely watch again...in fact i would genuinely love to see a sequel if they fleshed it out properly with some meaningful side and background characters and maybe a bit more depth for morbius himself. Overall i gave it 7/10 because despite a lot of lacking areas, it was a really good movie and a fun watch. I hope they take it further and not let this be the last we see of morbius.",Notr

1188,"I went and saw ""Morbius"" in theaters today despite the less than mediocre reviews. The movie had a great amount of potential yet lacked in execution. The plot and effects were subpar, but I still found enjoyment in the world the movie takes place in and the drive morbius has for finding a cure to his disease. Despite being a marvel villain origin movie, it lacks the feel of one. ""Morbius"" is more of a light take on the thriller genre. I feel that ""Morbius"" needed a better sense of direction or purpose as it could be all over the place at times. I feel the movie came to a quick conclusion not letting many events develop into what could've been. Overall seeing this movie was a decent experience, but not a memorable one. I didn't feel any sort of attachment towards any of the characters as I don't think they had a very strong presence or importance. ""Morbius"" is not a movie I would necessarily recommend to anyone that isn't interested in the movie.Concept: 4/5

1192,"""What hunts at night and drinks human blood?"" Near the end of the 20th Century two young boys, Milo and Morbius, are at a Greek hospital suffering with a rare and terminal blood disease. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) later becomes a scientific genius and using vampire bats he finds a cure, however there is a rather strong side effect - he becomes a vampire with superhuman powers! Not wanting to miss out Milo (Matt Smith) also takes the serum but he becomes evil with it. My TV guide described this as a Dark Marvel superhero fantasy but I think that action/horror is a better description. It started off reasonably interesting but by the halfway mark I had started to become bored, I was also fed up with the constant barrage of CGI effects, which incidentally were of poor quality. Most of the story is set in New York City but many of the buildings and accents were unconvincing, it didn't surprise me to discover afterwards that the film was made in England. There are some mid-credits scenes at the end, not being a Marvel fan they meant very little to me other than suggesting a possible sequel (groan). Leto looked good as Morbius, Matt Smith is a very good actor but he couldn't help save this rubbish.",Notr

Some of them seem to have a personal vendetta against Jared Leto and it is clearly influencing their ratings of this movie.If you had fun with The Last Witch Hunter or Gods of Egypt (same writers) then you'll probably have some fun with this movie too.The story isn't trying to be art, it's only try to be entertainment. And lets face it, half of the Marvel movies (at least) are totally unremarkable and uninspired. The only real difference between this movie and those is that Morbius (the character) doesn't have millions of rabid fans who blindly buy tickets and praise everything with his name on it.",Notr

Much green screen written all over it. Sure you would think it's too Batman, but only because of the bat scenes. Otherwise it can hold on its own. I only wish it was a longer film with more action scenes to go with it. I truly hope Morbius 2 is going to happen soon. I will be the first in line.",Notr

Studios clearly too involved in the film, feels like the films missing an hour.Should have stayed a horror film as it was leaning into during the beginning but then just dropped it for an action movie.Character has no real downside to ability especially compared to his comic origins.The action is a jumbled cgi mess of random slo-mos and distortion effectsR rated would have given ability to save this mess but studios chickened out.",Notr
1197,"I was looking forward to Morbius so much! I love vampire movies and I love superhero movies: what could go wrong? Well, pretty much everything... The story, the action (or lack thereof), the main character, the villain, the side characters, the CGI, the script, the lack of a real plot; literally everything was so poorly done, it was sad to watch.The story was completely lackluster: scientist gone awry because he has a rare disease that he will fix by splicing his DNA with bat DNA. Sure. You gotta come up with something to kick off the whole vampire shtick, it's a forgivable flaw. But then the vampire looks ridiculous! Everything looks so computer animated that Pixar would be jealous. O yeah, he moves so fast that he leaves a cloud of colorful farts behind. Why? Nobody knows! It just looks absurd, nothing to do with vampires and to top it off, it isn't remotely scary. In short, you have a main character and a predictable villain who are supposed to look super badass and be scary, but instead they might as well have worn a tutu and a tophat.One of the main shortcomings was that nothing made sense. Every single character just does something out of nowhere for the sake of absolutely nothing. All the characters are flatter than a coin. A villain being bad just for the sake of being bad. A romance that is super forced and without any use in the story. The presence of mercenaries on a boat in the middle of the fricking ocean, that only has two scientists on it. Come on! Seriously, why would you literally bring professional killers on a boat when you need no defense from anything or anyone? And why would they instantly turn on you when there is no money to be made from that? How do you know all these mercenaries in the first place when you're just a scientist? At least TRY to come up with some motive!Also forgivable, because we are going to see some awesome vampire rampage right? Guess again: the actual action is 100% abscent throughout the film. They tried (and failed) to cover up this weird choice by an overload of Matrix-like slow motion scenes, dodging a few bullets even. That's about as much action you will get to see in that 1,5 hour of your life that you wasted. It is completely baffeling that they chose to make a vampire/superhero movie while leaving out any realistic fights. Are they trying to cater to children and not allowed to show actual violence? Especially if nothing else interesting is going on, at least make it entertaining!The story is downright superficial and feels as if the writers didn't even care about their own movie. It's as though superhero movies nowadays just use the same old tired formula and throw a lot of money around to make yet another disappointing movie devoid of any real feeling. As long as it bring in the cash, I guess. It is just such a waste of money, time and effort, when it has so much potential to actually be something so awesome and instead becomes something so soulless and unremarkable.",Notr

Overall, one of the worst movies ever created with how much money was put into this and the output they got as there is not a single good thing to say about this movie (and I really hope nobody has to go through the struggle of having to see it, even for the meme).Terrible Direction (I do not understand how someone could do this bad of a job at directing, it was as if every scene was off and there was no consistent tone of style the director wanted to go for), Very Bad Acting (Pretty Bad to Bad from Jared Leto (A performance that had so many questions overall with what he was doing as it was very over-the-top/forced and not well executed (but he did show moments where he is someone who can act (its just that that was not the majority of the film))), Terrible to Very Bad from Matt Smith (His performance was just borderline annoying and really did not help with being the foil/villain to Morbius, it was just hard to believe overall cause of how questionable it was), Bad from Adria Arjona (She did have some range of emotion, but this did not save her from giving a phone-in performance that really did not play that much to the story at all as a love-interest), Pretty Bad from Jared Harris (His performance was actually the best because of how bad everyone else was, he really just was a neutral character that did not provide any value with what he did), Terrible to Very Bad from Al Madrigal (He just did not match the tone of the movie because he tried to be funny when it was serious and vice versa, and because of this his performance just felt so off and was hard to watch at times (so this bad performance maybe just a by-product of the movie being bad and inconsistent)), Very Bad to Bad from Tyrese Gibson (He just lacked any effort as it felt very phoned-in and effortless when he was trying to be serious and find truth), Terrible from the rest of the cast), Terrible Story (There is just so many jumps and assumptions made to the audience that the story does not come together at all (this can be especially be seen as Morbius just knows he has these powers without even showing us how he got them); also, there is just so many plot holes and boring moments that the writing really shows how bad it is), Terrible Screenplay (The dialogue is horrible and so unnatural that its borderline laughable that someone actually wrote this; also, the attempts at humor were so bad as it just left awkward silence rather than having the audience laugh; moreover, the character writing is terrible as you do not care about any of the characters introduced in this movie), Bad Score (it is just so poorly used and written as serious themes play during comedic moments and vice versa; also the score is just so loud at times that you can barely hear the dialogue), Terrible Cinematography (It felt like a fan made movie with how shaky and amateur the cinematography was), Bad Sound (It was so poorly mixed that I could barely hear the characters as times), Bad Editing (the actual different cuts and transitions between scenes was so poorly done it felt like this movie was made in Windows movie maker), Terrible Visual Effects (it was over-saturated throughout the entire movie and just felt extremely cartoony at times), Plot Structure was really poorly laid out as it spent no time in its exposition and developing the character to where once the climax comes the audience is just so confused with how Morbius got his powers and developed as a character; also there is no exposition as the movie just ends on a cliffhanger, Pacing was incredible fast and mismanaged to the point where the movie is incredibly short and there are so many questions left when the movie ended (if the movie was good I would have wanted to have seen like 30-40 more minutes, but I would not wish anyone to see 30-40 minutes more of this movie), Build to climax is nonexistent as we just get there with no background with how we are there; climax was horribly executed as we find out we were in the climax after the movie ends; also the actual fighting and over-saturation of CGI made it so boring and hard to watch, Tone was incredibly inconsistent as the moments where it was meant to be funny it tries to be serious and vice-versa (it was as if the director had no idea what type of movie he wanted to create), This movie is not bad to where it is funny it is just bad to where it is just so interesting how it even go made.",Notr
